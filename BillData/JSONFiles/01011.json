In affirming human life\nbegins at conception, the unborn are granted the right to due\nprocess under Section 1 of the 14th Amendment which\nexplicitly states, ``No state shall make or enforce any law\nwhich shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens\nof the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person\nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;\nnor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal\nprotection of the laws.'' The Life at Conception Act allows\nfor constitutional protection for the unborn that they not\n``be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due\nprocess of law'' afforded under the 5th Amendment.\n[Page H503]\n</pre>", "cosponsors": {"count": 166, "countIncludingWithdrawnCosponsors": 166, "url": "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/1011/cosponsors?format=json"}, "introducedDate": "2021-02-11", "latestAction": {"actionDate": "2021-04-23", "text": "Referred to the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties."}, "number": "1011", "originChamber": "House", "originChamberCode": "H", "policyArea": {"name": "Civil Rights and Liberties, Minority Issues"}, "relatedBills": {"count": 1, "url": "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/1011/relatedbills?format=json"}, "sponsors": [{"bioguideId": "M001195", "district": 2, "firstName": "Alexander", "fullName": "Rep.

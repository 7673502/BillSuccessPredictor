To make all Laws which shall be necessary and\nproper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and\nall other Powers vested by this Constitution in the\nGovernment of the United States, or in any Department or\nOfficer thereof.''\nLongstanding Supreme Court precedent recognizes Congress as\nhaving plenary power over immigration, giving it almost\ncomplete authority to decide whether aliens may enter or\nremain in the United States.\nIn exercising its power over immigration, Congress can make\nlaws concerning aliens that would be unconstitutional if\napplied to citizens. Demore v. Kirn, 538 U.S. 510, 522 (2003)\nCongress has sole authority to authorize aliens for work--\nthe executive branch does not share such authority with\nCongress.\n[Page H4343]\n</pre>", "cosponsors": {"count": 10, "countIncludingWithdrawnCosponsors": 10, "url": "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/5062/cosponsors?format=json"}, "introducedDate": "2021-08-20", "latestAction": {"actionDate": "2022-11-01", "text": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship."}, "number": "5062", "originChamber": "House", "originChamberCode": "H", "policyArea": {"name": "Immigration"}, "sponsors": [{"bioguideId": "G000565", "district": 4, "firstName": "Paul", "fullName": "Rep.

Section 8, clause 4, (the Naturalization Clause)\ngives Congress sovereign control over immigration. In Chirac\nv. Lessee of Chirac (1817), the Supreme Court affirmed that\nthe Constitution grants Congress Plenary power on immigration\npolicy. Further, in Galvan v. Press (1954) the court found\n``that the formulation of policies [pertaining to the entry\nof aliens and the right to remain here is entrusted to\nCongress has become about as firmly imbedded in the\nlegislative and judicial tissues of our body politic as any\naspect of our government.''\nFinally, in Sessions v. Dimaya (2018), when discussing the\naggravated felony definition in section 101(a)(43)(F) of the\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), Justice Neil Gorsuch\nissued an opinion stating, ``Congress remains free at any\ntime to add more crimes to its list. It remains free, as\nwell, to write a new residual clause that affords the fair\nnotice lacking here. Congress might, for example, say that a\nconviction for any felony carrying a prison sentence of a\nspecified length opens an alien to removal. Congress has done\nalmost exaclty this in other laws . . .''\n[Page H4251]\n</pre>", "cosponsors": {"count": 27, "countIncludingWithdrawnCosponsors": 27, "url": "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/4760/cosponsors?format=json"}, "introducedDate": "2021-07-28", "latestAction": {"actionDate": "2022-11-01", "text": "Referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship."}, "number": "4760", "originChamber": "House", "originChamberCode": "H", "policyArea": {"name": "Immigration"}, "relatedBills": {"count": 1, "url": "https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/117/hr/4760/relatedbills?format=json"}, "sponsors": [{"bioguideId": "G000565", "district": 4, "firstName": "Paul", "fullName": "Rep.

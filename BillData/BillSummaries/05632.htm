 <p><b>Long-Term Care Pharmacy Definition Act of </b><b>2021</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a statutory definition for <i>long-term care pharmacy</i> under the Medicare prescription drug benefit. </p> <p>Currently, there is no statutory definition.

Additional requirements are set out in CMS guidance relating to the Medicare prescription drug benefit; pharmacies are also subject to regulations and guidance from other agencies (e.g., packaging requirements from the Food and Drug Administration).<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p> <p>The bill defines a long-term care pharmacy as a state-licensed pharmacy that is able to provide enhanced pharmacy and clinical services to individuals who have certain comorbid and medically complex chronic conditions and who reside in skilled nursing facilities, nursing facilities, or any other applicable setting (as determined by the CMS).

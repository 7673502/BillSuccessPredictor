 <p>This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to establish a program to treat amounts paid by U.S citizens or business entities to move their inventory, equipment, and supplies from China to the United States as items of expense, deductible in the year in which they are incurred. The cost of this expensing allowance shall be paid for with tariffs collected by the United States on goods manufactured in China. </p>

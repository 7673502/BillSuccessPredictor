 <p><strong>Accountability for Online Firearms Marketplaces Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill removes the federal liability protection that a provider of an interactive computer service (e.g., a social media company) receives for content provided by third parties (sometimes referred to as Section 230 protection) if the provider operates an online firearms marketplace. <em>Online firearms marketplace</em> refers to an interactive computer service that (1) facilitates firearm-related transactions, (2) advertises or otherwise makes available proposals for transferring firearms, or (3) makes digital instructions for programming a three-dimensional printer to make a firearm.</p>

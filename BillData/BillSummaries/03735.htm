 <p><b>E-Filing Standards Improvement Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies requirements for electronic filing of tax returns. Specifically, it requires the Internal Revenue Service to issue an e-filing receipt to taxpayers who submit returns electronically that indicates acceptance or rejection of a return. If a return is rejected, the filing receipt must provide information for resolving the issue causing the rejection. The taxpayer shall be allowed 15 business days to correct and resubmit the return electronically. </p>

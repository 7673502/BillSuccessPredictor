 <p><b>LNG For Allies Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises the approval process for applications to export natural gas. Specifically, the bill expedites the approval process for certain U.S. allies, such as Taiwan and Ukraine. However, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission may not grant expedited approval for applications to export natural gas to any nation that is (1) designated as a state sponsor of terrorism, or (2) designated by acts of Congress from such expedited approval for reasons of national security.</p>

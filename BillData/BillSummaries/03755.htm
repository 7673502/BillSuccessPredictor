 <p><strong>Women's Health Protection Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill prohibits governmental restrictions on the provision of, and access to, abortion services.</p> <p>Specifically, governments may not limit a provider's ability to </p> <ul> <li>prescribe certain drugs,</li> <li>offer abortion services via telemedicine, or</li> <li>immediately provide abortion services when the provider determines a delay risks the patient's health. </li> </ul> <p>Furthermore, governments may not require a provider to </p> <ul> <li>perform unnecessary medical procedures,</li> <li>provide medically inaccurate information,</li> <li>comply with credentialing or other conditions that do not apply to providers whose services are medically comparable to abortions, or</li> <li>carry out all services connected to an abortion. </li> </ul> <p>In addition, governments may not (1) require patients to make medically unnecessary in-person visits before receiving abortion services or disclose their reasons for obtaining such services, or (2) prohibit abortion services before fetal viability or after fetal viability when a provider determines the pregnancy risks the patient's life or health.</p> <p>The bill also prohibits other governmental measures that are similar to the bill's specified restrictions or that otherwise single out and impede access to abortion services, unless a government demonstrates that the measure significantly advances the safety of abortion services or health of patients and cannot be achieved through less restrictive means.</p> <p>The Department of Justice, individuals, or providers may bring a lawsuit to enforce this bill, and states are not immune from suits for violations.</p> <p>The bill applies to restrictions imposed both prior and subsequent to the bill's enactment.</p>

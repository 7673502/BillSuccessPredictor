 <p><strong>Promoting New and Diverse Depository Institutions Act </strong></p> <p>This bill requires federal banking agencies to study the challenges faced by entities attempting to become chartered depository institutions and to develop a strategic plan to assist in the application process. The strategic plan must (1) promote the chartering of minority depository institutions and entities that could be certified as community development financial institutions, and (2) describe actions to increase the number of depository institutions located in underserved areas.</p>

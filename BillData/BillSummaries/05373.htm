 <p><strong>Valley-Wide Noise Relief Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill permits airports to implement partial or total mandatory nighttime curfews if they had a voluntary curfew in place before the passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 and meet other requirements. (That act imposes stringent requirements on airports seeking to implement night curfews and other types of noise rules or restrictions.)</p>

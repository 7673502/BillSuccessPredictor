 <p><b>Keeping the Lights On Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill allows an eligible employer a payroll tax credit equal to 50% of a limited amount of qualified fixed expenses paid by such employer in a calendar quarter. <i>Qualified fixed expenses</i> include a mortgage, rent, or a utility payment. </p> <p>An employer is eligible for such payroll credit if the employer was carrying on a trade or business that had not more than 1,500 full-time employees or not more than $41.5 million in gross receipts in 2019. The employer's business must have been suspended in a calendar quarter due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) and have experienced a significant decline in gross receipts due to that pandemic. </p> <p>The credit may not be claimed by the federal government or by any state or tribal government, or by U.S. possessions, but may be claimed by tax-exempt organizations. </p>

 <p><strong>Conservation and Innovative Climate Partnership Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Agriculture to award competitive grants to land-grant colleges or universities for raising public awareness, conducting workshops, and providing technical assistance to increase agricultural producers' voluntary adoption of conservation practices (e.g., alley cropping) and innovative climate practices (e.g., carbon sequestration). Grantees must carry out activities in partnership with at least one other entity, such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service, a land-grant college or university, a state entity, or a nonprofit organization.</p>

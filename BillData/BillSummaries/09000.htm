 <p><b>Hydrogen for Industry Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish grant programs to support the use of hydrogen in energy. Specifically, DOE must establish a grant program for projects that demonstrate the uses of hydrogen in heavy industry (e.g., steel, cement, glass, and chemical manufacturing). It also directs DOE to establish a grant program for (1) carrying out projects that demonstrate the end uses of hydrogen; (2) constructing a new commercial-scale facility that will use hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock; or (3) retooling, retrofitting, or expanding an existing facility to enable the use of hydrogen as a fuel or feedstock in industrial end-use applications of hydrogen.</p>

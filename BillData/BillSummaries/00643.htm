 <p><b>Stop Greenlighting Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants Act</b></p> <p>This bill prohibits a state from receiving certain federal law enforcement grants if it takes certain immigration-related actions. Specifically, a state may not receive such grants if it (1) issues a driver license to an individual who does not have proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful presence in the United States, or (2) prohibits a local or state government entity or official from sharing immigration enforcement information with the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

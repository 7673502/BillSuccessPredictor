 <p><strong>Prompt Approval of Safe Generic Drugs Act</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve certain applications to market a drug even if the drug's labeling lacks certain safety information.</p> <p>Specifically, an abbreviated application for approval of a generic drug shall not be ineligible for approval solely because the drug's labeling omits safety information that is protected under another drug's exclusivity protections. Similarly, a drug that is approved under this bill shall not be considered mislabeled for lacking such safety information. </p> <p>Generally, an abbreviated application, for the purposes of this bill, is one that (1) uses required information from studies not conducted by the applicant; or (2) seeks approval of a drug that is, for drug approval purposes, a duplicate of an already-approved drug.</p> <p>For any drug approved under this bill, the FDA shall require the drug's labeling to include any safety information that is necessary to assure safe use.</p>

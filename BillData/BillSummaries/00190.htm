 <p><b>Leave Ethanol Volumes at Existing Levels Act or the LEVEL Act </b></p> <p>This bill revises the renewable fuel program, including the renewable fuel standard (RFS). </p> <p>Under current law, the RFS specifies the minimum volume of renewable fuel, such as ethanol, that must be contained in gasoline sold in the United States. The RFS annually increases until 2022 when a minimum of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel must be blended into gasoline. The bill decreases the volume of renewable fuel that must be contained in gasoline to 7.5 billion gallons each year. The bill also revises the RFS to eliminate separate volume requirements for the following renewable fuel categories: advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, and biomass-based diesel.</p> <p>In addition, the bill revises requirements concerning waivers from the program. Petitions for waivers from requirements under the renewable fuel program may not be brought by a person who is subject to the requirements of the program, nor by the EPA on its own motion. </p> <p>The EPA may not authorize the sale of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, unless the gasoline was registered under the program and lawfully sold in the United States before this bill's enactment. </p> <p>The EPA must study the effects of gasoline that contains greater than 10% ethanol, including the effects on consumer products, such as nonroad vehicles.</p>

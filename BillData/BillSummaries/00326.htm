 <p><b>Saving the Civil Service Act</b></p> <p>This bill nullifies the executive order titled <i>Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service</i>, which was issued on October 21, 2020. The order places executive agency positions that are of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character, and that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition, under a new schedule in the excepted service (Schedule F) instead of the competitive service. The order also requires any such positions in the excepted service to be reclassified to Schedule F.</p> <p>The bill also specifically prohibits positions or appointments in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service from being converted to the excepted service, and prohibits certain noncompetitive appointments that were reclassified or made under the executive order from subsequently acquiring competitive status.</p>

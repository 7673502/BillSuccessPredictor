 <p><b>Defund Planned Parenthood Act of </b><b>2021</b></p> <p>This bill restricts federal funding for Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc. or any of its affiliates or clinics for one year.</p> <p>Specifically, it prohibits funding those entities unless they certify that the affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not provide funds to entities that perform, abortions during that year. If the certification requirement is not met, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture must recoup any federal assistance received by those entities.</p> <p>However, the bill's funding restriction does not apply to abortions performed in cases of rape or incest or when necessary to resolve a physical condition that endangers a woman's life.</p> <p>The bill also provides additional funding for community health centers for the one-year period. These funds are subject to the same abortion-related restrictions and exceptions.</p>

 <p><b>No Abortion Bonds Act </b></p> <p>This bill denies a tax exclusion for the interest paid on state and local bonds that are used to provide a facility owned or used (for any purpose) by an abortion provider for more than 30 days during a year in which interest is paid on the bonds. </p> <p>An entity is not considered an abortion provider solely as a result of performing abortions if (1) the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or (2) a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself. </p> <p>The Department of the Treasury may exempt certain hospitals from being considered an abortion provider by making the name of the hospital available on Treasury's public website. </p>

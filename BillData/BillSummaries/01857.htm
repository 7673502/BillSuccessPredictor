 <p><strong>Protecting Access to Safe and Effective Medicines Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill provides statutory authority for the existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) practice of defining <i>active ingredient </i>more narrowly as <i>active moiety</i> in certain situations, such as when determining whether a new drug is entitled to a market exclusivity period or providing priority review of drugs for treating rare pediatric diseases. </p> <p>Generally, the FDA defines <i>active moiety</i> as the core molecule or ion in a drug responsible for the relevant physiological or pharmacological action. By contrast, the FDA defines an <i>active ingredient </i>as a component in a drug that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect. The FDA's existing practice of interpreting <i>active ingredient</i> as <i>active moiety</i> in certain situations, as statutorily authorized by this bill, tends to exclude some drugs from market exclusivity.</p> <p>The bill replaces references to <i>active ingredient</i> with <i>active moiety</i> in various statutes authorizing FDA activities.</p>

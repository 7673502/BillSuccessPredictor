 <p><strong>Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill revises requirements for milk provided by the National School Lunch Program of the Department of Agriculture (USDA).</p> <p>Currently, schools participating in the program must provide milk that is consistent with the most recent Dietary Guidelines for Americans; USDA regulations require milk to be fat-free or low-fat and allow only fat-free milk to be flavored. The bill removes these restrictions and instead permits schools to offer students whole, reduced-fat, low-fat, and fat-free flavored and unflavored milk.</p>

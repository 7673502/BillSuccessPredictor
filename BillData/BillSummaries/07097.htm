 <p><b>Telehealth Treatment and Technology Act of 2022 or the 3T Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill allows a health care professional to provide, subject to scope of practice and other requirements, health services in any U.S. jurisdiction based on that individual's authorization to practice in any one state or territory.</p> <p>Additionally, the bill provides certain related powers to health care professional regulatory bodies, such as medical boards. Specifically, a regulatory body may investigate and take disciplinary actions against a professional who provides services pursuant to this bill to a patient in that body's jurisdiction. <p>The bill also requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to revise applicable privacy regulations to allow providers to use any nonpublic-facing communication product to provide telehealth services after the COVID-19 emergency ends. (Typically, communication products used to provide telehealth services must comply with federal privacy standards for personal health information. However, during the COVID-19 emergency HHS exercised enforcement discretion to allow for the use of noncompliant communication products, including applications such as Apple FaceTime, Zoom, or Skype.) <p>

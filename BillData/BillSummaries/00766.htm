 <p><strong>Taking Account of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act or the TAILOR Act </strong></p> <p>This bill requires federal financial regulatory agencies to (1) tailor any regulatory actions so as to limit burdens on the institutions involved,&nbsp;with consideration of the risk profiles and business models of those institutions; and (2) report to Congress on specific actions taken to do so, as well as on other related issues. The bill's&nbsp;tailoring requirement applies not only to future regulatory actions but also to regulations adopted within the last seven years.</p>

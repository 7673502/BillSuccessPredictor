 <p><strong>Burn Pit Registry Expansion Act</strong></p> <p>This bill expands the scope of the Airborne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Registry of the Department of Veterans Affairs by including burn pits located in Egypt and Syria under the definition of <i>open burn pits</i>. The registry allows certain veterans and service members to document their exposures and report health concerns related to exposure to toxic airborne chemicals and fumes caused by open burn pits (areas used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment) while serving in certain locations.</p>

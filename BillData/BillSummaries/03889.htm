 <p><strong>Providing Choice for Social Security Retirees Act</strong></p> <p>This bill allows an individual to claim a delayed-retirement credit for Social Security retirement benefits in a partial lump sum.</p> <p>Under current law, an individual's Social Security retirement benefits are increased by a&nbsp;two-thirds of 1% for each month in which the individual, after attaining full retirement age but prior to attaining age 70,&nbsp;delays claiming those benefits. The bill allows an individual who delays claiming&nbsp;Social Security retirement benefits to instead opt to receive a smaller percentage increase (one-half of 1%) for each applicable month,&nbsp;plus a one-time lump sum payable at the time of the individual's entitlement to the benefits. The amount of this lump sum shall equal the sum of the present values of one-sixth of 1% of the amount of the individual's monthly benefits for each month in the individual's life-expectancy period.</p>

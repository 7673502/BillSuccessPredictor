 <p><strong>Keep Kids in Schools Act</strong></p> <p>This bill prohibits a local educational agency (LEA) from obligating federal COVID-19 relief funds during any period when one or more elementary or secondary schools served by the LEA do not provide full-time, in-person instruction. This prohibition does not apply with respect to a school that does not provide full-time, in-person instruction due to following quarantine or isolation guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

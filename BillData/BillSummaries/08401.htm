 <p><b>Transit Oriented Development Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill increases the low-income housing tax credit for buildings in transit-oriented development areas. The bill defines a<i> transit-oriented development area</i> as a designated area located within 1/2 mile from a rail, bus, harbor, or waterway station and zoned for high density. It also provides for an increase in the credit for buildings in high cost areas in non-contiguous states (i.e., Alaska and Hawaii) and U.S. possessions. </p> <p>The bill directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development to study cost-of-living differences throughout the United States based on geographic location and proximity and accessibility to transit.</p>

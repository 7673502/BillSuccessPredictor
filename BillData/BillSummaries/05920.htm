 <p><b>Veteran Entrepreneurs Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill allows a business-related tax credit&nbsp;of 25% of up to $400,000 of the&nbsp;franchise fees paid or incurred by an eligible veteran&nbsp;for the purchase of a franchise. The bill reduces the amount of such credit if the veteran does not own 100% of the stock or capital or profits interest of the franchisee.</p> <p>An <em>eligible veteran</em> is a person who served in the active military, naval, or air service; was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable; and who pays or incurs a franchise fee in connection with a franchise agreement with a franchisor. </p> <p>The veteran may elect to transfer the credit to an eligible franchisor in exchange for a discount in the franchise fee commensurate with the value of the credit. </p> <p> The Small Business Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs must provide information about the tax credit allowed by this bill to veterans service organizations and veteran advocacy groups.</p>

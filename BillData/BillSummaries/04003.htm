 <p><strong>Work Without Worry Act</strong></p> <p>This bill modifies eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits for individuals who have a disability that began before age 22.</p> <p>Under current law, these individuals may obtain SSDI benefits based on the work record of a retired, disabled, or deceased parent. However, an individual with earnings after age 22 that exceed a specified monetary limit (i.e., constitute substantial gainful activity) permanently loses eligibility for such benefits.</p> <p>This bill allows individuals to retain eligibility for such benefits regardless of the amount of earnings after age 22. Additionally, individuals who apply for SSDI benefits on a parent's record and also independently qualify for Social Security benefits on their own record will receive the larger of the two benefit amounts.</p>

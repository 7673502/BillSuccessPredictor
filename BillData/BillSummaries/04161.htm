 <p><strong>Noise Mitigation Repair and Replacement Program Act</strong></p> <p>This bill makes some airports that previously received certain federal grants for noise mitigation eligible to apply for additional grants to repair and replace sound insulation and otherwise carry out noise mitigation efforts. The bill specifies the circumstances under which an airport may apply for additional grants, such as when increased aircraft noise would have afforded a different level of noise mitigation than was provided under the original grant.</p>

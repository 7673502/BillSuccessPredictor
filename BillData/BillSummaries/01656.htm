Such treatment may be furnished at a VA medical center, DOD medical facility, or through health care provider under the Veterans Community Care Program or TRICARE health insurance program.</p> <p>The bill also requires the VA and DOD to update the <em>VA/DOD Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) for the Management of PTSD </em>to ensure that information about stellate ganglion block is included.<br> </p>

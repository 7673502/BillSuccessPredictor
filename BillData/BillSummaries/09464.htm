 <p><b>Secure Space Act of 2022</b></p>   <p>This bill prohibits the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from granting licenses or access to U.S. markets for non-geostationary orbit satellite systems to certain producers or providers of communications equipment or services. Specifically, the FCC may not grant a license or market access to an entity that produces or provides equipment or a service that the FCC determines poses an unacceptable risk to national security or the security and safety of U.S. persons (e.g., Huawei Technologies Company and China Mobile International USA Inc.). </p> <p>Non-geostationary satellite systems are comprised of satellites that do not maintain a stationary position but rather move in relation to the Earth's surface; they may be used to provide broadband and other telecommunications services.</p>

 <p><b>Transparency for Confucius Institutes</b> <strong>Act</strong><strong></strong></p> <p>This bill requires an institution of higher education (IHE) that participates in federal student-aid programs to enter into a program participation agreement if a Confucius Institute operates on the IHE's campus. (Confucius Institutes are Chinese government-funded centers for language education and cultural programming at IHEs.)</p> <p>The agreement must be entered into with the Office of Chinese Language Council International (i.e., Confucius Institute Headquarters, Hanban) and be made publicly available online. </p> <p>Among other requirements, the Confucius Institute must be physically located apart from the IHE's own Chinese language, history, and cultural programs.</p>

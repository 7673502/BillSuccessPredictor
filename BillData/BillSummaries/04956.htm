 <p><b>Leadership in Global Tech Standards Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a program that supports the participation of U.S. small businesses in meetings and proceedings of standards development organizations to develop voluntary technical standards.</p> <p>To carry out this program, the SBA must award grants to small businesses for the reasonable costs of participation in standards development organizations.</p> <p>These grants may only be awarded to small businesses that (1) demonstrate technical expertise in key emerging technologies and technical standards (e.g., artificial intelligence), (2) commit personnel with such expertise to regular participation in global bodies responsible for developing standards for those technologies, (3) agree to coordinate between the public and private sectors to ensure protection of national security interests in the setting of global standards, and (4) provide a plan detailing the relationship between the above activities and the proposed standards to be adopted.</p>

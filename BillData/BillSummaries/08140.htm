 <p><strong>HBCU Research, Innovation, Security, and Excellence Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a pilot program to increase capacity for historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) that are designated as high research activity status to achieve and maintain very high research activity status. High research activity status (known as R2 status) and very high research activity status (known as R1 status) are classifications by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education.</p> <p>DOD must award grants to support research activities in the areas of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) and critical technologies. DOD may expand the program to other HBCUs beyond those that are classified as high research activity status if DOD determines that the program can support such an expansion.</p> <p>DOD must annually establish a list of research areas for STEM and critical technologies for which grant applicants may seek funding.</p>

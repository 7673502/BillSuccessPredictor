 <p><b>Energy Poverty Prevention and Accountability Act </b></p> <p>This bill addresses energy poverty (i.e., insufficient access to affordable energy) in at-risk communities. An <i>at-risk community</i> is a community that is low-income, minority, rural, elderly, or Native American.</p> <p>The Department of the Interior must report on (1) barriers to the ability of at-risk communities that live on or near federal land or tribal land to access reliable and affordable energy, including how the presence of adequate energy transmission infrastructure affects such access; and (2) actions that it and the Forest Service may take to reduce such barriers. In addition, certain executive actions may not be carried out until Interior conducts energy poverty studies for such actions.</p> <p>The Congressional Budget Office must report on how a bill or resolution will affect the cost of energy for at-risk communities.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must (1) analyze federal energy and environmental laws and regulations, and state renewable portfolio standards, to determine how such laws, regulations, and standards affected electricity prices, home heating prices, gasoline prices, motor vehicle prices, natural gas prices, and household appliance prices in at-risk communities; and (2) develop criteria to determine whether an at-risk community is experiencing energy poverty.</p> <p>The Office of Management and Budget must review and publish each applicable energy regulation to determine if any regulation imposes, relative to the general population, disproportionate costs on at-risk communities.</p>

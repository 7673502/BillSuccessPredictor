 <p><b>Forage Fish Conservation Act</b> <strong>of 2021</strong><strong></strong></p> <p>This bill addresses the management and conservation of forage fish. </p> <p>The Department of Commerce must issue a definition for the term <em>forage fish</em>. It must consider certain factors in defining such term, including whether a species covered by the definition (1) is at a low trophic level; (2) is generally small to intermediate-sized; (3) occurs in schools or other dense aggregations; (4) contributes significantly to the diets of other fish, marine mammals, or birds; and (5) serves as a conduit for energy transfer to species at a higher trophic level.</p> <p>Commerce must also establish guidelines to assist regional fishery management councils in (1) developing a list of unmanaged forage fish areas and prohibiting the development of any new forage fish fisheries until the potential impacts of such fisheries have been assessed; and (2)	setting annual catch limits for forage fish fisheries that assess, specify, and reduce such limits by the diet needs of other fish species and marine wildlife. </p> <p>The bill adds shad (American shad and hickory shad)	and river herring (blueback herring and alewife)	to the list of managed stocks for the New England and Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council.</p>

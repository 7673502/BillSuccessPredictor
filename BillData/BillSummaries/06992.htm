 <p><strong>Countering Russian Terrorism Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of State to designate Russia as a country where the government has repeatedly provided support for international terrorism. (Generally, such a designation imposes various penalties, such as limiting the country's eligibility for U.S. foreign assistance and arms exports.)</p>

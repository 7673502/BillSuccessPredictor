 <p><strong>Flood Insurance for Farmers Act of 2022 </strong></p> <p>This bill revises the National Flood Insurance Program to allow exemptions of certain agricultural structures from flood-proofing or elevation standards while receiving coverage under the program. The bill also provides for optional umbrella coverage for commercial, residential (including multifamily rental units), and agricultural property to be made available to all applicants with multiple structures on the same property.</p>

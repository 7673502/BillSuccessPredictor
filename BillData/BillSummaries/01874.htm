 <p><b>Expand Navigators' Resources for Outreach, Learning, and Longevity Act of 20</b><strong>21</strong><b> or the ENROLL Act of 20</b><strong>21</strong></p> <p>This bill makes several changes to the navigator program for health insurance exchanges (a program&nbsp;through which entities receive funding to provide education and enrollment assistance). Specifically, the bill addresses certain funding decisions and regulatory actions taken by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS). </p> <p>For example, the bill increases funding for navigators in federally facilitated exchanges (FFEs) beginning in FY2022. (The CMS decreased annual funding for FFE navigators for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 program years.)</p> <p>The bill also counters guidance issued by the CMS regarding navigator criteria by requiring FFE navigators to be chosen without regard to&nbsp;how the entity provides information about association health plans or short-term, limited-duration insurance. </p> <p>The bill also reinstates certain requirements that were removed by the CMS in 2018. Specifically, the bill requires (1) at least two navigators in each FFE, including at least one community and consumer-focused nonprofit group; and (2) that navigators be physically present in the state where the exchange is located. </p>

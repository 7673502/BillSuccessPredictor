 <p><strong>Stop Enabling Repeat Violence and Endangering Our Communities Act or the SERVE Our Communities Act</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the Bureau of Justice Assistance to make grants to states and local governments for mentoring, transitional services, and training to help offenders successfully reintegrate back into the community after incarceration. To be eligible for a grant, a state or local government must take steps to prevent repeat offenses by violent offenders and allow a state court or magistrate to consider the danger an individual poses to the community when determining bail or pretrial release conditions. <br> </p>

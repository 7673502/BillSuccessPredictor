 <p><strong>Climate Agricultural Conservation Practices Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Natural Resources Conservation Service within the Department of Agriculture to consider climate benefits, such as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, in reviews or revisions of its conservation practice standards.

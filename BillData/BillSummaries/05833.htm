 <p><strong>Equine Tax Fairness Act</strong></p> <p>This bill modifies the tax treatment of gains and losses from the sale of depreciable property used in a trade or business to eliminate <em>horses</em> from the definition of <em>livestock</em> (thus making the 24-month holding period requirement for livestock inapplicable to horses and allowing horses to be treated as capital assets subject to the existing 1-year holding period requirement for long-term capital gains). </p> <p>The bill also makes permanent the 3-year recovery period for the depreciation of race horses.</p>

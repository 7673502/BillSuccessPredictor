 <p><b>2020 WHIP+ Reauthorization Act</b></p> <p>This bill expands the Department of Agriculture's Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) to include coverage for losses of crops (including smoke-tainted wine grapes) due to wildfires occurring in calendar year 2020. Under current law, the program provides disaster payments to agricultural producers who suffered crop, tree, bush, and vine losses resulting from hurricanes, wildfires, and other qualifying natural disasters that occurred in the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.</p>

 <p><strong>American Safety And Fairness through Expedited Removal Act of 2022 or the American SAFER Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill expands the classes of non-U.S. nationals (aliens under federal law) who are subject to expedited removal (i.e., removal from the United States without further hearing or review).</p> <p>Specifically, the bill nullifies a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2004/08/11/04-18469/designating-aliens-for-expedited-removal" target="_self">2004 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) rule</a>&nbsp;that generally limits expedited removal to certain situations, such as for non-U.S. nationals encountered within 14 days of entry into the United States without inspection and within 100 miles of a U.S. international land border. </p> <p>The bill also (1) prohibits DHS from implementing a rule that limits expedited removal based on how far a non-U.S. national was from the border when encountered or apprehended, and (2) modifies the relevant statute to state that expedited removal authority applies regardless of where the non-U.S. national was encountered or apprehended. </p>

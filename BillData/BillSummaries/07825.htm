 <p> <b>No Funding for Sanctuary Campuses Act</b></p> <p>This bill makes an institution of higher education (IHE) that is a sanctuary campus ineligible for federal student-aid funds. In general, a sanctuary campus is an IHE that has a policy of restricting its personnel from cooperating with federal officials in enforcing the immigration laws or that harbors or provides educational benefits to aliens who lack a lawful immigration status. </p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security must transmit to the Department of Education and publish in the Federal Register notice of a determination that an IHE is a sanctuary campus.</p>

 <p><b>Tradeable Performance Standard Act</b></p> <p>This bill establishes the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Reduction Program, which creates (1) targets to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from cogeneration facilities (e.g., combined power plants), electric facilities, and thermal energy facilities; (2) a system to allow such facilities to achieve the targets through a voluntary emission trading program; and (3) a thermal energy reporting program.</p> <p>By 2030, such facilities must reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 60% of 2019 levels. By 2040, the facilities must eliminate the emissions.</p> <p>Facilities that emit more than the targets must purchase emission allowances from those who emit less. The bill provides for the distribution, trading, and tracking of such allowances. The bill establishes civil penalties for facilities that do not meet the targets and do not submit enough allowances.</p> <p>Finally, the Environmental Protection Agency must establish a thermal energy reporting program. Under the program, thermal energy facilities must provide information about the fuel used to produce thermal energy and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with such production. Further, thermal energy facilities must submit information to demonstrate their compliance with this bill.</p>

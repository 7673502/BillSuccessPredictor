 <p><b>Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II</b></p> <p>This bill revises requirements under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program for the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant in San Diego, California.</p> <p>Currently, the plant must meet standards established under the NPDES permit program for the primary and secondary treatment of wastewater discharged by the plant into marine waters. The city of San Diego may apply for permit modifications, which offer alternatives to certain secondary treatment standards. </p> <p>This bill eliminates the need for the city to obtain a separate permit for such modifications. Instead, the city may apply to obtain the permit modifications under the main NPDES permit if the plant meets certain conditions, such as the implementation of a pretreatment program.</p>

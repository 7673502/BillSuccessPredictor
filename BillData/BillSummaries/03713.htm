 <p><strong>Space Infrastructure Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security to designate space systems, services, and technology as a critical infrastructure sector. Under current law, <em>critical infrastructure</em> means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p>

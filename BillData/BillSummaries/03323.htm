These advances are secured by assets such as mortgages and other loans. </p> <p>Specifically, the bill allows FHLBs to provide advances that are secured by (1) loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, and (2) certain loans made in response to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and guaranteed or insured by the federal government. </p> <p>The bill also expands the availability of advances to certain community development financial institutions and credit unions.

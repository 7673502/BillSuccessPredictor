 <p>This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to issue guidance on minimizing the use of firefighting foam and other equipment that contains perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances, commonly referred to as PFAS, to minimize the risk to firefighters, other first responders, and the environment, without jeopardizing firefighting efforts. PFAS are man-made and may have adverse human health effects. A variety of products contain PFAS, such as nonstick cookware or weatherproof clothing.</p>

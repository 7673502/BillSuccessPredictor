 <p><b>Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 20</b><strong>21</strong><br /><br />This bill makes it unlawful to manufacture, sell, or distribute crib bumpers or inclined sleepers for infants.&nbsp;Specifically, inclined sleepers for infants are those designed for an infant up to one year old and have an inclined sleep surface of greater than 10 degrees. Crib bumpers generally are padded materials inserted around the inside of a crib and intended to prevent the crib occupant from becoming trapped in any part of the crib's openings; they do not include unpadded, mesh crib liners. </p>

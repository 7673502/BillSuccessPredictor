 <p><strong>Canadian Trucker Freedom Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill provides asylum or refugee status to certain Canadian nationals involved in protests and waives certain requirements.</p> <p>Specifically, asylum or refugee status shall be available to a Canadian national who (1) engaged in nonviolent protest; (2) suffered certain harm, such as reputational harm, from their involvement in such protests and the government of Canada's invocation of the Emergencies Act; (3) continues to be subject to such harm; (4) requests asylum or refugee status at a port of entry or U.S. consulate; (5) consents to and tests negative for COVID-19; and (6) did not unlawfully enter the United States. </p> <p>Under this bill, such an individual may receive asylum or refugee status without a credible fear of persecution. (Generally, current law requires an individual applying for asylum or refugee status to be screened for credible fear, and their application is rejected if no credible fear is found.)</p>

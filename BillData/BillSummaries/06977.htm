 <p><b>American Gas for Allies Act</b></p> <p>This bill deems the exportation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for allied countries to be consistent with the public interest for purposes of the National Gas Act during the next three years. Thus, the bill allows such exports to be expedited during that time period. In order to be expedited, the LNG export must be for (1) a member country of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or (2) any other foreign country if the Department of State determines that the export of LNG to that country would promote the national security interests of the United States.</p>

 <p><strong>Medical Care Equity Act</strong></p> <p>This bill allows a tax deduction for the unreimbursed Medicare-based value of qualified charity care (i.e., physicians' services furnished without expectation of reimbursement, including medical screenings and treatment for emergency medical conditions and labor-related treatments).</p> <p>The bill also specifies that a physician is not liable under federal or state law for harm caused by an act or omission of the physician, or attending medical personnel supporting the physician, if the act or omission (1) occurs in the course of furnishing charity care, and (2) was not grossly negligent. The bill preempts laws of a state or locality that are inconsistent with this exemption, unless the laws provide greater protection from liability for a defendant.</p>

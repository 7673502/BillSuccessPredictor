 <p><b>Protect America's Paper for Recycling Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable resources to revise the definition of <em>municipal solid waste</em>. </p> <p>The bill specifies that municipal solid waste does not include paper that is commonly recycled and that has been segregated from other solid waste, or solid waste that is collected as part of a system that does not provide for the separate collection of paper that is commonly recycled from residential solid waste. The bill includes exceptions for incidental and residual waste.</p> <p>In the case of a facility that produces electricity both from municipal solid waste and other solid waste that is not a qualified energy resource (1) the facility is a qualified facility if it otherwise meets the requirements for qualified facilities, and (2) the credit only applies to the portion of the electricity produced from municipal solid waste.

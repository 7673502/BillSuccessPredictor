 <p><strong>Making FHA Work for Borrowers with Student Debt Act of 2021 </strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to modify its treatment of student loan debt for purposes of determining eligibility for federally insured mortgages for single-family homes. Specifically, the FHA must calculate a borrower's student loan debt obligation as the monthly payment required in connection with the loan or, if no monthly payment is required, 0.5% of the outstanding balance of the loan. Currently, the FHA calculates a borrower's student loan debt obligation as 1% of the outstanding balance of the loan. </p>

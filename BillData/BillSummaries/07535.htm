 <p><strong>Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act</strong></p> <p>This bill addresses the migration of executive agencies information technology systems to post-quantum cryptography. Post-quantum cryptography is encryption strong enough to resist attacks from quantum computers developed in the future.</p> <p>Not later than one year after the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued post-quantum cryptography standards, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall begin to prioritize the migration of agency information technology systems to post-quantum cryptography.</p> <p>Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this bill, the OMB shall submit to Congress a report on</p> <ul> <li>a strategy to address the risk posed by the vulnerabilities of agency information technology systems to the potential capability of a quantum computer;</li> <li>the funding necessary to secure such information technology systems from the threat posed by adversarial access to quantum computers; and </li> <li>a description and analysis of ongoing coordination efforts with international standards development organizations and consortia to develop standards for post-quantum cryptography, including any federal Information Processing Standards. </li> </ul>

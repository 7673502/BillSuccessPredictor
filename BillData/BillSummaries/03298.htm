 <p>This bill revises the emergency relief program of the Department of Transportation to require that a project for the permanent repair or construction of a repeatedly damaged facility includes feasible and economically justifiable betterments (including protective features) to increase the resiliency of such facility. The emergency relief program provides funds for emergency and permanent repairs on federal-aid highways and roads that have suffered serious damage because of a natural disaster or catastrophic failure from an external cause.</p>

 <p>This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to limit chromium-6 in drinking water. Specifically, the bill directs the EPA to publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for chromium-6, which must include a filtration requirement. Adverse health effects associated with exposure to chromium-6 include some types of cancer. Chromium-6 occurs naturally and it is also produced by industrial processes. It is used in coating to protect metals from corrosion, stainless steel production, wood preservation, and textile dyeing.</p>

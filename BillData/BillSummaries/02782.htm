 <p><b>Woman's Right To Know Act</b></p> <p>This bill specifies requirements for&nbsp;informed consent that health care providers must obtain before performing an abortion procedure.</p> <p>Providers must present a woman seeking an abortion with an authorization form at least 24 hours before performing the procedure. The form must (1) include specified information concerning gestational age, associated developmental characteristics,&nbsp;and medical risks; (2) disclose penalties&nbsp;that&nbsp;providers may face for failing to obtain the requisite informed consent; and (3) include an affirmation that the individual signing the form understands the information. The form must be signed and witnessed in person and retained in the medical file.</p> <p>Providers do not&nbsp;have to obtain such consent if, in reasonable medical judgment, obtaining it would pose a greater risk of death or substantial physical impairment of a major bodily function, excluding psychological or emotional conditions, of the pregnant woman.</p> <p>The bill also establishes civil penalties for providers who do not comply with these requirements.</p>

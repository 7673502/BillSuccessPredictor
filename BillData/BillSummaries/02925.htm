 <p><strong>Freedom for Families Act</strong></p> <p>This bill prohibits using federal funds for facilities used to detain noncitizen families and addresses related issues.</p> <p>Specifically, no funds made available may be used to operate or construct a family detention center, whether operated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or a contractor. This prohibition shall also apply to funds made available before this bill's enactment.</p> <p>Funds obligated to operate such centers must instead be used for implementing and developing nondetention programs that are community-based and consistent with international best practices.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may place an apprehended noncitizen family into such a nondetention program if DHS makes an individualized determination that doing so will facilitate the family's compliance with immigration laws. The programs must provide to participants a legal orientation and meaningful access to counsel. </p>

 <p><b>Territorial Tax Parity and Clarification Act</b> </p> <p> This bill modifies the income source rules that apply with respect to the taxation of capital gains from certain personal property sales in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI).</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires capital gains income earned by a USVI resident to be considered USVI source income regardless of the tax rate imposed by the USVI government. (Under current law, a similar rule applies to other U.S. territories, including Guam, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Puerto Rico.)</p>

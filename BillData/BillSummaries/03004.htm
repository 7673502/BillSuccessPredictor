 <p><b>Jobs Now Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Labor to carry out a two-year pilot program to award grants to general local governmental units or community-based organizations to retain, employ, or train employees who provide a local government unit with a public service (i.e., job creation). At least 50% of grant funds must be used to retain employees who&nbsp;would otherwise be laid off due to budget cuts. </p> <p>Labor must encourage grantees to use grant funds to retain, employ, or train veterans, individuals with disabilities, individuals receiving unemployment benefits, or dislocated workers.</p>

 <p><b>Interregional Transmission Planning Improvement Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to issue a rule to evaluate the effectiveness of planning processes for projects concerning electric energy transmission across regions.</p> <p>The rule must address (1) the effectiveness of existing planning processes for identifying interregional transmission projects that provide economic, reliability, operational, and public policy benefits, including reductions in carbon emissions; (2) changes to such processes to ensure that efficient, cost-effective, and broadly beneficial transmission solutions are selected for cost allocation; and (3) cost allocation methodologies that reflect the multiple benefits provided by interregional solutions.</p>

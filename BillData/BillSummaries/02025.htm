 <p><b>Litigation Funding Transparency Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires lawyers for plaintiffs in certain lawsuits to provide the court and other parties in the lawsuit with any agreement that entitles an outside business (i.e., a business that is not a party, class member, or counsel in the lawsuit) to receive payment contingent on the lawsuit's outcome. The lawyers for the plaintiffs shall also provide the identity of the outside business.</p> <p>Specifically, these requirements shall apply to any class action or multi-district litigation (i.e. related civil cases pending in different districts that are consolidated for pretrial proceedings).<br /> </p> <p style="margin: 0in; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"> </p>

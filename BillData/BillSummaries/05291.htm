 <p><b>Democracy in Design Act</b> </p> <p>This bill requires the General Services Administration (GSA) to ensure that the construction and acquisition of federal public buildings (e.g., agency office buildings) adheres to the principles of the report titled <i>Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture</i>. </p> <p>The report was published by the Ad Hoc Committee on Federal Office Space on June 1, 1962, and serves as the policy directive for the GSA's Design Excellence Program within its Public Buildings Service. Among other principles, the report prescribes against the development of an official architectural style for government buildings and encourages the government to avoid excessive uniformity in building design.</p> <p>The GSA must issue such regulations as necessary to implement the amendment made by this bill and to establish minimum standards for the construction and acquisition of public buildings in the United States.</p>

 <p><strong>Justice for Vaccine Victims Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill terminates the COVID-19 emergency and requires an investigation into adverse events associated with a COVID-19 vaccination. The bill also repeals federal income tax deductions for certain state, local, and foreign taxes paid by an individual.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must terminate the COVID-19 emergency within three months of the bill's enactment. The bill also removes, within three months of that termination, liability protections that apply to the administration or use of certain medical countermeasures (e.g., vaccines) during the public health emergency.</p> <p>Additionally, the HHS Office of Inspector General must investigate adverse events associated with a COVID-19 vaccine that are reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. In carrying out the investigation, the office must ask specified questions of (1) each individual (or the individual's survivors) who reported an adverse event, (2) each manufacturer of a COVID-19 vaccine distributed in the United States, and (3) a sample of health care providers. The office must report its findings and recommendations, and the report must include, among other matters, transcripts of all interviews with individuals, manufacturers, and health care providers. The office must also report on the costs of carrying out this investigation.</p>

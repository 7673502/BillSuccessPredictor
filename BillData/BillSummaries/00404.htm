 <p><b>Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act</b> <b>of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill addresses certain driftnet fishing. Driftnet fishing is a method of fishing in which a gillnet composed of a panel or panels of webbing, or a series of such gillnets, is placed in the water and allowed to drift with the currents and winds for the purpose of entangling fish in the webbing.</p> <p>Currently, the use of large-scale drift gillnets with a total length of 2.5 kilometers or more is prohibited in the United States.	The bill expands the definition of large-scale driftnet fishing to prohibit the use of gillnets with a mesh size of 14 inches or greater. This expanded prohibition does not apply within the U.S. exclusive economic zone for five years.</p> <p>The Department of Commerce must conduct a transition program to facilitate the phase out of large-scale driftnet fishing and to promote the adoption of alternative fishing practices that minimize the incidental catch of living marine resources. </p> <p>Commerce must award grants to program participants.</p>

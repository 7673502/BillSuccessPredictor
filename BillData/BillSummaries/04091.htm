 <p><strong>National Flood Insurance Program Consultant Accountability Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to terminate certain contracts under the National Flood Insurance Program on the basis of detrimental conduct to the program by a covered entity (an attorney, law firm, consultant, or third-party company that provides certain services under the contract). Specifically, on such basis, FEMA may terminate a contract between a covered entity&nbsp;and a Write Your Own company (a property and casualty company that writes and services federal standard flood insurance policies in its own name).</p> <p>FEMA shall establish a process for a covered entity to appeal such a termination.</p> <p>Neither FEMA nor a Write Your Own company is required to make an early-termination payout to a covered entity with respect to a contract terminated under the&nbsp;bill.</p>

 <p><strong>Securing Systemically Important Critical Infrastructure Act</strong></p> <p>This bill sets out a process to designate elements of critical infrastructure as systemically important. <em>Critical infrastructure</em> refers to the machinery, facilities, and information that enable vital functions of governance, public health, and the economy.</p> <p>Specifically, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) must establish a methodology based on objective criteria to designate critical infrastructure as systemically important. In developing the criteria, CISA must consider, among other factors, the scale of the potential effects of a disruption to the infrastructure on domestic security, the economy, health, or safety.</p> <p>Using the methodology, CISA must make a preliminary designation and then provide an opportunity for the infrastructure's owner or operator to share additional information. A preliminary designation becomes final after 30 days unless, on the basis of additional information, CISA determines the infrastructure does not meet required criteria.</p> <p>The bill also requires CISA to</p> <ul> <li>maintain a list of systemically important critical infrastructure,</li> <li>prioritize systemically important critical infrastructure in its programs and activities,</li> <li>report on various matters related to the designation process, and</li> <li>assess processes for and benefits of enhanced risk management coordination between the federal government and the owners and operators of systemically important critical infrastructure.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must prioritize the security clearance applications of owners and operators of systemically important critical infrastructure.</p>

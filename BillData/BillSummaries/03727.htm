 <p><strong>Fair-Value Accounting and Budget Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Congressional Budget Office to provide certain fair-value estimates of federal loan and loan guarantee programs. Under the bill, the <em>fair value </em>is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair-value estimates generally use private-market interest rates to estimate the cost of a loan program rather than rates based on Treasury securities.</p>

 <p><b>Public School Green Rooftop Program</b></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a grant program for installing and maintaining green roof systems on public elementary and secondary school buildings. <i>Green roof</i> refers to a layer of vegetation that is planted over a waterproofing system or to a waterproof management practice that is installed on a roof and may support plant growth.</p> <p>Specifically, DOE must award grants to public elementary and secondary schools, local educational agencies, and partnerships with nonprofit organizations to (1) pay the costs of planning assistance for green roof systems on school buildings (e.g., assessing structures, conducting financial and engineering analyses, and receiving cost estimates), and (2) install green roof systems on these buildings.</p> <p>Additionally, a grant recipient must complete the installation of a green roof system within four years of receiving the grant. A grant recipient that completes this installation requirement shall receive additional funding for maintenance activities, such as conducting routine inspections to monitor the condition of the green roof.</p>

 <p><b>Ensuring Access to General Surgery Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to study access by underserved populations to general surgeons.</p> <p>Specifically, HRSA must study (1) whether the health professional shortage area designation under the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program accurately assesses adequacy of access to general surgeons, (2) whether another measure would be more accurate, and (3) potential methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas. (The NHSC provides scholarships and student loan repayment awards to primary care, dental care, and mental health care providers who agree to work in areas that HRSA designates as having a shortage of those particular types of providers.)</p> <p>HRSA must also publish data comparing the availability and need of general surgery services in urban, suburban, and rural areas.</p> <p>On the basis of its study, HRSA may establish a methodology for designating general surgery shortage areas and make such designations. If any designations are made, HRSA must publish a list of general surgery shortage areas.</p>

 <p><strong>Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2021</strong></p> <p> This bill directs the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to implement a demonstration program for the establishment or preservation of limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled housing. Limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled housing (e.g., a housing cooperative) restricts the initial and resale price of shares of stock or membership interests in a residence so that the shares or interests remain affordable to families of certain incomes. </p> <p>Specifically, HUD may assist nonprofit organizations to establish or preserve such housing through providing (1) mortgage insurance; and (2) grants for predevelopment costs, monitoring fees, technical assistance, gap funding, and intermediary financing. </p> <p>Housing receiving such assistance must be governed by a board of directors elected by members of a limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled housing corporation with voting structured equitably among all members. </p> <p>A limited- or zero-equity resident-controlled housing corporation may sell corporate shares in such housing to an eligible household for a purchase price that ensures dwelling units in the housing will remain affordable for at least 30 years to households earning less than a certain income. </p>

 <p><b>Small Business Succession Planning Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Small Business Administration (SBA) to establish a program to assist small businesses with developing and implementing business succession plans. The bill also provides a tax credit for a business that establishes a succession plan or that successfully carries out such a plan.</p> <p>A business succession plan identifies who will assume the ownership responsibilities of a small business upon the owner's death or retirement, and it includes an operational description of the small business to ensure the continuation of operations.</p> <p>To carry out the program, the SBA must develop and make publicly available a toolkit to assist small business with succession planning. Further, it must train resource partners on the toolkit, educate small businesses about the program, and ensure that each SBA district office and each resource partner employs someone to counsel small businesses on using the toolkit.</p>

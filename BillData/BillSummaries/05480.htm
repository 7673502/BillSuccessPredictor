 <p>This bill places certain restrictions on employer-based vaccination requirements.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill prohibits the Department of Labor from issuing an emergency temporary occupational safety or health standard that requires employers to ensure their employees receive a vaccine.</p> <p>In addition, the bill expressly applies the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) to occupational health and safety rules issued by Labor. Currently, RFRA prohibits the government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, except in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest when using the least restrictive means.</p>

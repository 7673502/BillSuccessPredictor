 <p><strong>Consumer Financial Choice and Capital Markets Protection Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill allows a money market fund, under specified conditions, to elect to operate using a different method of valuation than&nbsp;is otherwise required. A money market fund that elects to do so shall not be subject to specified&nbsp;requirements related to the imposition of liquidity fees. (A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in liquid, short-term assets.)</p> <p>Current law limits the provision of certain&nbsp;federal assistance directly to any money market fund. The bill requires disclosure of this limitation on federal assistance in a money market's&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;and sales literature.</p>

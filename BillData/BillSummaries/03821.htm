 <p>This bill provides funding to expand the Department of Agriculture's Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) to include coverage for losses of crops (including losses due to high winds or derechos) occurring in 2020. Under current law, the program provides disaster payments to agricultural producers who suffered crop, tree, bush, and vine losses resulting from hurricanes, wildfires, and other qualifying natural disasters that occurred in 2018 and 2019. </p>

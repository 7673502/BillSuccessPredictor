 <p>This bill directs the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to carry out a loan repayment program for certain specialty medicine physicians who provide care in rural communities with shortages of such physicians. Physicians must agree to a period of obligated service and, for each year of such service, HRSA must pay one-sixth of the principal payment and interest on eligible loans up to a maximum cap of $250,000. <br /></p>

 <p><b>Vaccinate More Americans Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill allows health care providers to disregard federal, state, or local laws or guidelines that prioritize COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) vaccinations for essential workers and other at-risk groups when necessary to prevent the expiration of a vaccine dose.</p> <p>If a dose cannot be administered to a member of a prioritized group before it expires, a provider may vaccinate an individual in a lower priority group.</p>

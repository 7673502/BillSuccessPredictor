 <p><strong>No Taxpayer Funding for Vaccine Passports Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill prohibits the use of federal funds to develop a system that requires proof of an individual's COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) vaccination status as a condition of performing any action. If a state, territory, or locality implements such a system, it loses eligibility for specified COVID-19 relief funding.</p>

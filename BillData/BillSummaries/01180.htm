 <p><b>Accurate Workplace Injury and Illness Records Restoration Act</b></p> <p>This bill expands the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to cite employers for workplace safety violations and requires OSHA to issue a rule on record keeping related to workplace injuries.</p> <p>Under current law OSHA may cite employers only during the six-month period following a violation. This bill provides that, for a violation that occurs over a period of time, the six-month period does not begin until the violation has ended.</p> <p>The bill also requires OSHA to issue a rule on maintaining records of workplace injuries and illnesses. Congress nullified a similar rule on April 3, 2017.</p> <p>In the rule required by the bill, OSHA must clarify that an employer's duty to make and maintain accurate records</p> <ul> <li>is an ongoing obligation,</li> <li>continues for as long as the employer is required to keep records of the recordable injury or illness (typically five years under current OSHA rules), and</li> <li>does not expire solely because the employer fails to create the necessary records when first required to do so. </li> </ul>

 <p><strong>Puerto Rico Air Cargo Industry Empowerment Act</strong></p> <p>This bill modifies foreign civil aircraft regulation with respect to air cargo in Puerto Rico. Current law prohibits foreign civil aircraft from exchanging cargo in the United States unless the aircraft is specifically authorized to do so or the exchange occurs in Alaska. This bill applies air cargo regulation to Puerto Rico in the same way that it applies to Alaska. Thus, the bill allows foreign civil aircraft to stop in Puerto Rico and exchange cargo with other air carriers.</p>

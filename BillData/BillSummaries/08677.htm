 <p><b>Infrastructure Modernization Project Related to the OVerall Enhancement of Nursing Homes Act or the IMPROVE Nursing Homes Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to establish a grant program to support the conversion of traditional nursing facilities to small-house nursing facilities (i.e., facilities that offer private rooms for up to 12 residents in separate buildings or areas). Grant funds may be used to convert facilities but not for facility operation; grant recipients must agree to provide person-centered care that supports certain resident flexibilities and to operate such facilities for at least 20 years.</p>

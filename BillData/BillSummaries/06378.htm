 <p><strong>Local Control Act</strong></p> <p>This bill imposes requirements on the placement in a state of a non-U.S. national (<em>alien</em> under federal law) without lawful immigration status.</p> <p>Specifically, before such an individual may be settled in, housed in, or transported to a state or political subdivision within a state, the Department of Homeland Security must notify the office of the governor of that state and the office of the chief executive of the political subdivision. No federal funds may be used for the proposed settling, housing, or transporting if (1) the state governor's office does not approve of the action, or (2) the political subdivision in question has a law or resolution prohibiting or disapproving of such an action. </p> <p>These requirements shall not apply to the use of federal funds to transport or detain such an individual for civil or criminal law enforcement purposes.</p>

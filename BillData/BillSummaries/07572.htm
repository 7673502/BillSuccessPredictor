 <p><strong>University Centers for Growth, Development, Prosperity (GDP) Act</strong></p> <p> This bill requires the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to establish in each state a university center at an institution of higher education that must, to the extent possible, collaborate with economic development districts, provide technical assistance and business development services to area businesses, and conduct research and analysis relating to economic development. In selecting such centers, the EDA must prioritize Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and other minority-serving institutions.</p>

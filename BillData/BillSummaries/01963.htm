 <p><strong>Child Care Choices Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill requires states to prioritize the availability of child care certificates over grants or contracts when providing federally supported child care assistance to families. A child care certificate is a voucher provided directly to a parent who may use the voucher only as payment for child care services.</p> <p>The bill also prohibits states from setting differential payment rates based solely on the type of child care or type of provider.</p>

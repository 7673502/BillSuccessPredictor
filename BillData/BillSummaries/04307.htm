 <p><strong>John Tanner Fairness and Independence in Redistricting Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes requirements regarding congressional redistricting, including that redistricting plans must be developed by an independent redistricting commission.</p> <p>A state that has been redistricted after an apportionment of Representatives may not be redistricted again until after the next apportionment, unless the state is ordered by a court to conduct a subsequent redistricting in order to comply with the Constitution or enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p> <p>Each state must establish an independent redistricting commission to develop redistricting plans that meet specified criteria. If such a plan is not enacted into law, a state's highest court may select a plan developed by the state's commission. If the state court does not select a plan, a U.S. district court must develop a plan.</p> <p>The Election Assistance Commission must make payments to states to carry out redistricting.</p>

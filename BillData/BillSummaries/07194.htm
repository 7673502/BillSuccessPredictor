 <p><b>Employee Rights Act</b><br> <br> This bill makes various changes with respect to the collective bargaining process and labor relations.<br> <br> For example, the bill permits an employer to refuse to collectively bargain with a union within 90 days prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement if the employer receives evidence that the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit do not support the union.<br> <br> The bill requires support from a majority of the employees in the bargaining unit (not just a majority of the employees voting) when electing union representation. The bill also requires unions to provide bargaining unit employees with the right to vote by secret ballot, including when voting whether to engage in a strike or refusal to work.<br> <br> Further, union dues, fees, assessments, and other contributions may be used for only collective bargaining or contract administrative functions.<br> <br> Additionally, the bill establishes a process for nullifying executive orders that the Office of Management and Budget determines are likely to result in an employer ordering a plant closure or mass layoff.</p> <p><br> </p>

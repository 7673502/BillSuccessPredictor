 <p><strong>Planning for Aging Veterans Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill addresses the long-term care of veterans, including by implementing policies for the administration of state homes.</p> <p>First, the bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a strategy for the long-term care of veterans.</p> <p>The VA must develop a standardized process for entering into sharing agreements between state homes and VA medical centers. A<em> state home </em>is a home established by a state for veterans who are disabled by age, disease, or otherwise and incapable of earning a living because of such disability. The term also includes a home that furnishes nursing home care for veterans.</p> <p>Under the bill, the VA must furnish prescribed drugs and medicines to veterans who are catastrophically disabled and for whom the VA is paying a per diem for nursing home or domiciliary care in a state home. Generally, veterans are <em>catastrophically disabled</em> if they have a permanent severely disabling injury, disorder, or disease that compromises the ability to carry out the activities of daily living.</p> <p>The VA must monitor any contractor it uses to conduct inspections of state homes, including by reviewing inspections, reporting deficiencies, and publishing inspection results and any planned corrective actions on a public VA website.</p> <p>The VA must implement a two-year pilot program to provide geriatric psychiatry assistance to eligible veterans at state homes.</p> <p>Finally, the VA must work with public housing authorities and local organizations to assist aging homeless veterans in accessing existing housing and supportive services.</p>

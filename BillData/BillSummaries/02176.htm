 <p><b>Ensuring Access to Domestic Mineral Production Act</b></p> <p>This bill limits the authority of the Department of the Interior to withdraw federal public lands from mineral exploration.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill prohibits Interior from making such a withdrawal until a study has been completed that demonstrates that the proposed withdrawal will not result in any negative impacts to national security by limiting access to critical minerals.</p> <p>In addition, the bill requires Interior to obtain the approval of Congress before withdrawing federal public lands in excess of 5,000 acres.</p> <p>Before any withdrawal is initiated, the U.S. Geological Survey must conduct a mineral assessment to ensure that the minerals to be withdrawn by a proposed withdrawal do not impede the ability of the United States or its allies to procure a secure supply chain of essential resources needed for the U.S. economy and allied nations, including resources for national security and for U.S. energy infrastructure.</p>

 <p><b>Border Safety and Security Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to suspend the entry of any non-U.S. nationals (<i>aliens</i> under federal law) without valid entry documents during any period when DHS cannot detain such an individual or return the individual to a foreign country contiguous to the United States. A state may sue DHS to enforce this requirement. </p> <p>(Under current law, non-U.S. nationals who arrive at the border without entry documents are generally subject to expedited removal. However, if such an individual is found to have a credible fear of persecution, they are typically subject to detention while their asylum claim is being considered.)</p> <p>The bill also authorizes DHS to suspend the entry of non-U.S. nationals without entry documents at the border if DHS determines that such a suspension is necessary to achieve operational control over such a border. </p>

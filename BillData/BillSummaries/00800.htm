 <p><b>Preference for Local Veteran Contractors Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to give preference to local contractors for purposes of awarding contracts for the construction or maintenance of a VA facility or for services provided to a particular VA facility or campus. Local contractors are those who submit a bid or proposal and have principal offices or locations within a 60-mile radius of the VA facility covered by the contract. Per the bill, the VA must publish a public notice explaining why a local contractor was not awarded a contract if another contractor is selected.</p> <p>The bill also updates the order of priority for awarding contracts to small business concerns to include priority for local contractors.</p>

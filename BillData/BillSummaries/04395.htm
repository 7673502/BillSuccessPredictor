 <p><b>Payment Choice Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires retail businesses to accept cash as a form of payment for sales in amounts less than $2,000, and it prohibits them from charging cash-paying customers a higher price compared to customers not paying with cash. Such businesses are those engaged in the business of selling or offering goods or services at retail to the public that accept in-person payments at a physical location.</p> <p>The bill provides for enforcement through preventative relief and civil penalties.</p>

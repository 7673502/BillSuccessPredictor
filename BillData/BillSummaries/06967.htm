 <p><b>Chance to Compete Act of </b><b>2022</b></p> <p>This bill modifies examination requirements and other components of the federal hiring process for positions in the competitive service.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill provides that a qualifying examination includes a r&eacute;sum&eacute; review that is conducted by a subject matter expert. Additionally, beginning two years after the bill's enactment, the bill prohibits examinations from consisting solely of a self-assessment from an automated examination, a r&eacute;sum&eacute; review that is not conducted by a subject matter expert, or any other method of assessing an applicant's experience or education.</p> <p>Agencies may use subject matter experts to develop position-specific technical assessments that allow applicants to demonstrate job-related skills, abilities, and knowledge; assessments may include structured interviews, work-related exercises, procedures to measure career-related qualifications and interests, or other similar assessments. The bill also allows agencies to establish talent teams to support and improve hiring practices.</p> <p>The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) must create online platforms through which agencies may share and customize technical assessments and share the r&eacute;sum&eacute;s of qualifying applicants. The OPM must also create online platforms with information about the types of assessments used and hiring outcomes.</p>

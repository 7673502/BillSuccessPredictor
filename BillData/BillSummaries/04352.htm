 <p>This bill authorizes the Department of the Interior to take land into trust for all federally recognized Indian tribes.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill applies the Indian Reorganization Act to all federally recognized Indian tribes, regardless of when a tribe became recognized. The amendments made by this bill are retroactively effective as if included in the Indian Reorganization Act. This effectively overrules the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Carcieri v. Salazar, </i>which held that Interior could not take land into trust for a specified tribe because that tribe had not been under federal jurisdiction when the Indian Reorganization Act was enacted in 1934.</p>

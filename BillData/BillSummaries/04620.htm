 <p>This bill limits the exemption for family offices from the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) regulations applicable to investment advisers. A family office is a privately held company that manages a single family's wealth. Currently, a family office is generally not considered an investment adviser for purposes of SEC regulation regardless of the amount of managed assets, and is therefore not subject to regulations relating to duties, recordkeeping, and disclosures. </p> <p>The bill limits the exemption to include only family offices with less than $750 million in managed assets. Furthermore, the SEC must exclude from the exemption certain persons subject to a final order regarding fraudulent conduct, among other activities.</p>

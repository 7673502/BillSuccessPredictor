 <p><strong>Alternative Protein Pilot Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of the Navy to establish a three-year pilot program to offer plant-based protein options at forward operating bases. The Navy must select at least two naval facilities to participate in the program, and must prioritize facilities where livestock-based protein options may be costly to obtain or store.</p>

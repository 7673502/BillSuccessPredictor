 <p><strong>Booster Seat Safety Act</strong></p> <p>This bill addresses labeling requirements and testing standards for booster seats used in motor vehicles.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires labels on booster seats to include the minimum recommended age (4 years) and weight (40 pounds) for a child to use the seat. It also requires that a label on a car seat or combination car seat list the maximum weight and height limits of the seat, as well as a recommendation to continue using the seat until the child exceeds the listed limits.</p> <p>Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) must either establish a minimum height recommendation for booster seats or a method for manufacturers to use to determine a minimum height recommendation. Once the minimum height or method is established, booster seat labels must also contain the minimum height recommendation.</p> <p>The NHTSA must also establish a standard for side-impact crash tests for booster seats and provide guidelines for creating a testing dummy that approximates a six-year old child for such crash tests.</p> <p>Further, the NHTSA must study systems for tethering child restraint systems in vehicles and make recommendations about using or modifying tether systems to maximize child safety.</p>

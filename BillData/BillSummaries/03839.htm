 <p><b>Notch Fairness Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill increases Social Security retirement benefits for certain individuals born between 1917 and 1921, referred to as the Notch years. Currently, these individuals receive lower cost-of-living increases than individuals born in 1916 or earlier, as a result of legislative changes to Social Security benefits enacted in 1977. Under the bill, eligible individuals may elect to (1) recompute and increase their current primary insurance amount according to a specified schedule, or (2) receive lump sum payments over four years totaling $5,000.</p>

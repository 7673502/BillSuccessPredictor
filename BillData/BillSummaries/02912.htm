 <p><b>Truth in Tuition Act of </b><strong>2021</strong></p> <p>This bill requires institutions of higher education (IHEs) that participate in federal student-aid programs to provide admitted students with information related to tuition and fees. Specifically, the bill requires an IHE to provide to a student (1) a multi-year tuition and fee schedule; or (2) a single-year tuition and fee schedule and a nonbinding, multi-year estimate of net costs after financial aid is awarded. The Department of Education may waive this requirement under certain circumstances.<br /></p>

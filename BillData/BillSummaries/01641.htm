 <p><b>Promoting Infrastructure by Protecting Our Subcontractors and Taxpayers Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises the transportation infrastructure finance and innovation program to require the Department of Transportation (DOT) to ensure that the design and construction of a project carried out under the program must have appropriate payment and performance security, regardless of whether the obligor is a state, local government, agency or instrumentality of a state or local government, public authority, or private party.</p> <p>DOT may accept such payment and performance security requirements if it makes a written determination that the federal interest is adequately protected.</p>

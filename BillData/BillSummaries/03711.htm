 <p><b>Safely Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research In Vehicle Evolution Act or the SELF DRIVE Act</b></p> <p>This bill establishes the federal role in ensuring the safety of highly automated vehicles by encouraging the testing and deployment of such vehicles. A <i>highly automated vehicle</i> is a motor vehicle, other than a commercial motor vehicle, that is equipped with an automated driving system capable of performing the entire dynamic driving task on a sustained basis. </p> <p>The bill preempts states from enacting laws regarding the design, construction, or performance of highly automated vehicles or automated driving systems unless such laws enact standards identical to federal standards. </p> <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) must require safety assessment certifications for the development of a highly automated vehicle or an automated driving system. </p> <p>Manufacturers of highly automated vehicles must develop written cybersecurity and privacy plans for such vehicles prior to offering them for sale. </p> <p>The bill applies certain safety exemptions and testing standards to highly automated vehicles. </p> <p>DOT must (1) inform prospective buyers of highly automated vehicles of the capabilities and limitations of such vehicles; (2) establish the Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council to, among other things, develop guidance regarding mobility access for the disabled, elderly, and underserved populations; (3) require all new passenger motor vehicles less than 10,000 pounds to be equipped with a rear seat occupant alert system; and (4) research updated safety standards for motor vehicle headlamps.</p>

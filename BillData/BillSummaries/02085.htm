 <p><strong>Help Extract Animals from Red Tape Act of 2021 or the HEART Act of 2021</strong></p> <p> This bill modifies notice requirements in a civil forfeiture proceeding that involves the seizure of an animal involved in animal fighting.</p> <p>Specifically, the government must notify interested parties of an animal's seizure within 30 days (currently, 60 days). The notice period may be extended only if a delay is warranted after considering certain factors, including the cost to the government of providing shelter for the animal, the health of the animal and the effect of a delay on its rehabilitation, any increased risk that a delay could necessitate the euthanasia of the animal, and any psychological harm incurred by the animal's owner due to the delay in disposition.</p> <p>Additionally, the bill authorizes amounts in the Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund to be used to pay for costs associated with a seized animal, including transportation, shelter, care, veterinary services, and humane euthanasia.</p>

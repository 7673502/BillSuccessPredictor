 <p><b>Healthy Breakfasts Help Kids Learn Act of 20</b><strong>22</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide additional food (known as commodity assistance) to states participating in the School Breakfast Program (SBP). Under current law, USDA provides commodity assistance to states participating in the National School Lunch Program based on the number of lunches served. The food may also be served as part of the SBP or other child nutrition programs.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill (1) repeals a provision that prohibits USDA from offering commodity assistance based on the number of school breakfasts served, and (2) requires USDA to use a specified formula to provide additional commodity assistance for each school breakfast served.</p>

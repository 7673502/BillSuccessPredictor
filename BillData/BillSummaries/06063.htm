 <p>This bill confers exclusive jurisdiction to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma's land claim arising under the Treaty of Grouseland. The court must render judgement without regard to defenses based on the passage of time, including the statute of limitations. The United States is the only entity liable for such a claim, and monetary damages are the only available remedy. This jurisdiction expires unless such a claim is filed within one year.</p> All other claims of the tribe, including claims to title arising under the Treaty of Grouseland and the Northwest Ordinance, are extinguished.

 <p>This bill treats certain price protection payments from Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) as eligible rollover distributions (i.e., tax-free distributions from a qualified retirement plan to another eligible plan). Price protection payments are made under a price protection agreement and provide a guaranteed minimum price for shares that may temporarily decline in value as a result of loans to the ESOP to purchase shares.</p> <p>The bill treats price protection payments made after December 12, 2019, for plan years ending before January 1, 2023, as eligible rollover distributions if payments were made pursuant to a price protection agreement for distributions due to separation from service, retirement, death or disability. For plan years beginning after 2022, payments made under a price protection agreement as a result of any separation of service of a plan participant (regardless of the reason for such separation) would be eligible for rollover.</p>

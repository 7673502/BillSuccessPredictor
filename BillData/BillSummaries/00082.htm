 <p><b>Social Security Fairness Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill repeals provisions that reduce Social Security benefits for individuals who&nbsp;receive other benefits, such as a pension from a state or local government. </p> <p>The bill eliminates the <em>government pension offset</em>, which in various instances reduces Social Security survivors' benefits for spouses, widows, and widowers who also receive government pensions of their own. </p> <p>The bill also eliminates the <em>windfall elimination provision</em>, which in some instances reduces Social Security benefits for individuals who&nbsp;also receive a pension or disability benefit from an employer that did not withhold Social Security taxes. </p> <p>These changes are effective for benefits payable after December 2021.</p>

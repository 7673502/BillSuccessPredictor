 <p><b>Energizing Technology Transfer Act</b></p> <p>This bill provides support for the development of clean energy and related technology. For example, the bill requires the Office of Technology Transitions within the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a grant program for clean energy incubators that accelerate the commercial application of clean energy technologies. In addition, DOE must establish a Clean Energy Technology University Prize, under which students compete to develop business models for furthering the commercial application of innovative clean energy technologies.</p>

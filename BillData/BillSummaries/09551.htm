 <p>This bill expands the information allowed when calculating whether an acquisition or disposition of a subsidiary is significant for purposes of required financial disclosures by publicly traded companies. Currently, an acquisition or disposition is considered significant when the company's investment in the subsidiary is calculated to exceed 10% of the aggregate worldwide market value of the company's voting and non-voting common equity. Under the bill, this market value may additionally include applicable trading value, conversion value, or exchange value of all of the company's outstanding classes of stock, including preferred stock and non-traded common shares that are convertible into or exchangeable for traded common shares.</p>

 <p><b>Managing Predators Act</b></p> <p>This bill gives states the authority to manage the populations of gray wolves and to determine if the wolves are endangered or threatened species.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill permanently removes the populations of gray wolf in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wyoming from the federal endangered and threatened species list.</p> <p>In addition, the bill revises requirements for the gray wolf in any state other than Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wyoming. If the population of the gray wolf, as estimated by such state, is at or above a population goal established by the state, then the Department of the Interior may not make a determination that the wolf in such state is an endangered or threatened species.</p>

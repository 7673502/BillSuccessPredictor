 <p><b>Parental Right to Protect Act</b></p> <p>This bill makes states ineligible for funds under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act if the state's child protective services system is permitted to (1) remove a child from the custody of the child's parent or legal guardian because the parent or legal guardian is reluctant or refuses to consent to a gender-transition intervention for the child; or (2) use such reluctance or refusal as evidence of abuse or neglect.</p>

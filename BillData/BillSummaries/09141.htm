 <p><strong>Visitor Visa Wait Time Reduction Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of State to report to Congress on the average waiting time to get a visitor visa interview at each diplomatic or consular post.&nbsp; For each post where the average waiting time is longer than 300 days, the State Department must temporarily reassign personnel at that post to shorten the waiting time.</p>

 <p><b>Ensuring Sound Guidance Act</b></p> <p>This bill generally requires investment advisors and fiduciaries of employer-sponsored retirement plans to make investment decisions based only on pecuniary factors (i.e., factors that a fiduciary prudently determines are expected to have a material effect on the risk and return of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons consistent with the plan's policies and objectives). </p> <p>The bill allows nonpecuniary factors to be considered in certain situations, such as when a customer specifically requests that these factors be considered or when selecting investment options for certain participant-directed retirement plans. </p>

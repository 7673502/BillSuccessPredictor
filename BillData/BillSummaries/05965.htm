 <p><b>Clean Hydrogen Deployment Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management to establish a pilot program that supports the development of clean hydrogen as an energy source. Under the pilot program, the office must enter into contracts with entities to pay for their costs associated with the production or purchase of clean hydrogen. Clean hydrogen must be produced with at least 80% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than conventional hydrogen.</p>

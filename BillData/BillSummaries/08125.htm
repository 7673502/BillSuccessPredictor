 <p><strong>Starter-K Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill allows employers who do not provide a retirement plan to establish a starter 401(k) deferral-only arrangement for plan years beginning after 2022. The bill defines <em>starter 401(k) deferral-only arrangement</em> as any cash or deferred arrangement that meets specified automatic deferral requirements, contribution limitations, and notice requirements. Such arrangements also allow catch-up contributions for individuals age 50 and over and exempt such employers from complying with certain participation and discrimination standards.</p>

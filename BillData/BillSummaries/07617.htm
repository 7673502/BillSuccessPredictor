 <p><strong>Preventive Care Awareness Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill requires activities to promote the use of preventive health care services with a particular focus on decreasing disparities in accessing preventive services for individuals in rural and underserved communities who delayed or forewent recommended preventive services during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Specifically, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must carry out a campaign to increase public awareness about and use of recommended preventive services. HHS must also convene a task force to develop recommendations regarding preventive services during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. The recommendations must address, among other considerations, reducing disparities in health outcomes and identifying barriers to implementing the recommendations.</p> <p>Additionally, the bill allows states, Indian tribes, and territories to use a portion of their Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant funding for FY2023 and FY2024 on activities to increase patient uptake of recommended preventive services.</p>

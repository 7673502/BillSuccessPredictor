 <p><strong>Coronavirus Provider Protection Act </strong></p> <p>This bill generally exempts health care professionals and related health care entities (e.g., hospitals and medical clinics) from liability for harm caused in the course of arranging or providing health care services during the COVID-19 public health emergency. To be exempt from liability, professionals and entities must provide these services in good faith, even if a service is outside a professional's normal area of practice, or withhold these services for reasons related to the COVID-19 public health emergency. </p> <p>However, this exemption does not apply (1) if the act or omission constitutes willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the individual harmed; or (2) if the professional provides the services while under the influence of alcohol or certain drugs.</p>

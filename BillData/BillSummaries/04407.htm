 <p><b>Technical Reset to Advance the Instruction of Nurses Act or the TRAIN Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies the methodology and application of Medicare Advantage nursing and allied health education payments for hospitals. Specifically, for 2010-2019, the bill eliminates the annual cap on total payments and excludes any resulting increase from factoring into calculations for graduate medical education payments for such hospitals. (The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services recently issued guidance providing for the recalculation and correction of certain payments to account for the annual payment cap.) </p>

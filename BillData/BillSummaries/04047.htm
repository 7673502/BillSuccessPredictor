 <p><strong>Cutting Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens Act</strong></p> <p>This bill generally requires agencies to repeal at least two rules before promulgating a major rule (i.e., a rule with a significant economic impact, cost to consumers, or adverse effects on competition). Further, unless required by law, an agency may not issue a rule that exceeds the total cost of the rules to be repealed without approval by the Office of Management and Budget.</p> <p>These requirements do not apply to major rules related to agency procedures, the Armed Forces, national security, or foreign affairs.</p>

 <p><strong>Open Access Evapotranspiration Data Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to establish an Open Access Evapotranspiration (OpenET) Data Program under which the USGS shall provide for delivering satellite-based evapotranspiration data to advance the quantification of evaporation and consumptive water use. The bill defines <em>Evapotranspiration</em> as the process by which water is transferred from the land to the atmosphere by evaporation from soil and other surfaces and transpiration from plants.</p> <p>As part of the program, the USGS shall </p> <ul> <li>provide data users with field-scale estimates of evapotranspiration data across large landscapes over certain periods of time, </li> <li> enter into cooperative agreements with program partners (e.g., institutions of higher education, states, private sector entities, or nongovernmental organizations) to provide for the efficient and cost-effective administration of the program, and </li> <li> provide nonreimbursable matching funding for programmatic and operational activities.</li> </ul>

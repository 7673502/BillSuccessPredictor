 <p><strong>Rehabilitating Economic Success Through Overcoming Rural Emergencies Act or the</strong> <strong>RESTORE Act</strong></p> <p>This bill expands the Department of Agriculture's Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) to include coverage for losses of crops due to high winds or derechos, polar vortexes (including losses to dairy cooperatives due to power outages or curtailments), hailstorms, freeze, and droughts occurring in the 2020 and 2021 calendar years, with specified limitations. Under current law, the program provides disaster payments to agricultural producers who suffered crop, tree, bush, and vine losses resulting from hurricanes, wildfires, and other qualifying natural disasters that occurred in the 2018 and 2019 calendar years.</p>

Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system.</p> <p>The trials must include a control group and an experimental group that are of similar sizes and structures and represent the demographics of the veteran population.</p> <p>Data collected in the trials must be preserved to facilitate further research.</p> <p>Under the bill, participation in the clinical trials does not affect a covered veteran's eligibility or entitlement to other VA benefits.

 <p><b>Lead Elimination and Data Guidance Act or the LEAD Guidance Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency to develop guidance to help public water systems identify high-risk locations for purposes of (1) testing the concentration of lead in drinking water, and (2) replacing lead service lines. <i>High-risk locations</i> are areas that contain an environmental justice community and that are likely to have lead service lines.</p>

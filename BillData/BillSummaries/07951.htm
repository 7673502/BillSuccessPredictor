 <p><b>Telework Metrics and Cost Savings Act</b></p> <p>This bill prohibits executive agencies from reducing or otherwise limiting the level of employees who may telework below the level in effect at the time of the bill's enactment. Agencies must also report on their plans to increase the number of teleworking employees and any resulting cost savings; the Office of Personnel Management must also issue guidance on how agencies can more effectively collect data on telework use and implementation, including any cost savings.</p>

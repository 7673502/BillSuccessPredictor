 <p>This bill revises certain requirements under the Federal Pell Grant Program for students with disabilities.</p> <p>Currently, Pell Grant awards are based on enrollment status and a student must attend an institution of higher education (IHE) on a full-time basis in order to receive the maximum award amount. This bill provides an exception for a student with a disability who is receiving appropriate and reasonable accommodations for such disability. Specifically, the bill requires the amount of a Pell Grant to be calculated as if such a student is attending an IHE on a full-time basis, without regard to whether the student is attending less than full time.</p> <p>Additionally, the bill extends the period of time during which a student with a disability may receive a Pell Grant. In particular, the bill allows a student to exceed the current 12-semester limit to complete the first undergraduate baccalaureate course of study if required by the student's accommodations.</p>

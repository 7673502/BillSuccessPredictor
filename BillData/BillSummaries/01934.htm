 <p><b>Promoting United States International Leadership in 5G Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill directs the President to establish an interagency working group to provide assistance and technical expertise to enhance U.S. leadership in international bodies&nbsp;that set&nbsp;standards for 5th and future generations of mobile telecommunications (5G) technology, such as the International Telecommunication Union. The President shall also work to increase the participation of allies, partners, and the private sector.

 <p><b>Respect for Marriage Act</b></p> <p>This bill provides statutory authority for same-sex and interracial marriages. </p> <p>Specifically, the bill replaces provisions that define, for purposes of federal law, <i>marriage</i> as between a man and a woman and <i>spouse</i> as a person of the opposite sex with provisions that recognize any marriage that is valid under state law. (The Supreme Court held that the current provisions were unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Windsor </em>in 2013.)</p> <p>The bill also replaces provisions that do not require states to recognize same-sex marriages from other states with provisions that prohibit the denial of full faith and credit or any right or claim relating to out-of-state marriages on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin. (The Supreme Court held that state laws barring same-sex marriages were unconstitutional in <em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em> in 2015; the Court held that state laws barring interracial marriages were unconstitutional in <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> in 1967.) The bill allows the Department of Justice to bring a civil action and establishes a private right of action for violations. </p>

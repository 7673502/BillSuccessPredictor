 <p><b>Organ Donation Clarification Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill specifies that certain payments and pilot programs relating to organ donation do not violate the National Organ Transplant Act, which prohibits the exchange of valuable consideration for human organs.</p> <p>Specifically, it excludes additional types of reimbursements and payments related to organ donation from the definition of <i>valuable consideration</i>, such as costs for (1) dependent care; (2) certain medical expenses for up to 10 years after a donation; (3) paperwork or legal services; and (4) term life insurance policies, subject to some limitations.</p> <p>In addition, the federal government, states, or local governments may carry out pilot programs to evaluate the effects of removing disincentives or providing noncash benefits on the availability of organs for transplant, provided these programs meet ethical and other conditions.</p>

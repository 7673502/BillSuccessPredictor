 <p><b>Making College More Affordable Act</b></p> <p>This bill creates federal interest-free education loans for undergraduate students. The loans must generally have the same terms and conditions and benefits to borrowers as Federal Direct Stafford Loans. Interest on these loans may only accrue during periods when a borrower is earning taxable income, is in repayment on such loans, and is not making payments under a repayment plan.</p> <p>The Department of Education (ED) must carry out a repayment plan program for the interest-free loans under which loan payments are automatically withheld from the wages of the borrower.</p> <p>ED must cancel any outstanding balance of principal or interest due on those interest-free loans made to a borrower who has made 360 monthly payments.</p> <p>The bill also allows for a tax deduction for amounts paid on these loans.</p>

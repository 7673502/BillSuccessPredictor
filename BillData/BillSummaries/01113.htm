 <p><b>Renewable Fuel Standard Integrity Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill revises requirements for exemptions from the renewable fuel standard (RFS) given to small refineries of crude oil. The existing RFS requires transportation fuel to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuel. The bill establishes an annual deadline for petitions by small refineries for exemptions from the RFS. In addition, the bill subjects information in the petition to public disclosure requirements.</p>

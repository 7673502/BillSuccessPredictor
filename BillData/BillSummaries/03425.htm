 <p><strong>Saving Gig Economy Taxpayers Act</strong></p> <p>This bill modifies requirements for third party settlement organizations to eliminate their reporting requirement with respect to the transactions of their participating payees unless they have earned more than $20,000 on more than 200 separate transactions in an applicable tax period. A <em>third party settlement organization</em> is the central organization that has the contractual obligation to make payments to participating payees (generally, a merchant or business) in a third party payment network. </p> <p>This reverses a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 that lowered the reporting threshold to $600 with no minimum on the number of transactions.</p>

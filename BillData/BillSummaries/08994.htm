 <p><strong>Supporting Our First Responders Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to award grants on a competitive basis to nongovernmental or governmental entities that provide medical transport and emergency medical services (EMS). Grant recipients may use funds to, for example, support the EMS workforce (e.g., by providing salaries and stipends or covering certification costs) and purchasing vehicles, personal protective equipment, and other resources.</p>

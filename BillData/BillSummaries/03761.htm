 <p><b>Promising Pathway Act</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a provisional approval pathway for medicines intended for serious or life-threatening diseases, including illnesses posing a threat of epidemic or pandemic. The period of the provisional approval is for two years and is potentially renewable.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must establish a priority review system to evaluate completed provisional approval applications within 90 days of receipt.

A manufacturer that fails to comply with registry requirements is subject to civil penalties.</p> <p>A provisionally approved drug must be labeled as such.</p> <p>If a drug that receives provisional approval status is not brought to market within 180 days of the approval, the approval must be rescinded.</p> <p>The bill also limits the liability of a manufacturer of a provisionally approved drug with respect to any claim under state law alleging that the drug is unsafe or ineffective.</p> <p>Private health insurers and federal health care programs shall not deny coverage of a provisionally approved drug on the basis of it being experimental.</p>

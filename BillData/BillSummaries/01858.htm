 <p><b>U.S. Military Right to Carry Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires a state that receives funds under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program to have implemented (1) a law or policy authorizing members of the Armed Forces who are outside of their state of residence under orders to renew a permit to carry a concealed firearm through the mail, and (2) a law or policy that treats members of the Armed Forces on active duty in the state as residents of the state for purposes of issuing a permit to carry a concealed firearm in the state. The Department of Justice must reduce by 5% the amount that a state would otherwise receive under the grant program if the state fails to comply with either requirement.</p>

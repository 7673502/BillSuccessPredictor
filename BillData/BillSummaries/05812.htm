 <p><b>National Patient ID Repeal Act</b></p> <p>This bill repeals the requirement that the Department of Health and Human Services adopt a standard unique health identifier for each individual, employer, health plan, and health care provider.</p> <p>The provision has not been implemented to date because language included in annual appropriations acts has prohibited the use of federal funds for developing a unique identifier. However, some appropriations bills introduced in recent years have not included this funding restriction.</p>

This policy shall not apply to humanitarian assistance implemented by an entity not controlled by Burma's military. </p> <p>The President may waive this policy on a case-by-case basis upon certifying that doing so would substantially promote delivering humanitarian assistance to Burma's civilian population or otherwise support U.S. national interests.</p> <p>This policy shall be repealed upon the earlier of (1) the President certifying that certain events have occurred, including Burma's military releasing all political prisoners and the instatement of an elected government following free and fair elections; or (2) 10 years after this bill's enactment.</p>

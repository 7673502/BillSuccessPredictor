 <p><b>Emergency Community Care Notification Time Adjustment Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill modifies the Veterans Community Care Program by requiring the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to deem as authorized emergency care or services provided by a non-VA provider to a covered veteran if the veteran (or an individual acting on the veteran's behalf) submits an application for such authorization by a deadline determined appropriate by the VA, which may not be earlier than 72 hours following the veteran's discharge from the facility. Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system or those who are not enrolled but are eligible for care due to a service-connected disability.</p>

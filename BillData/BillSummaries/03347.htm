 <p><strong>Generating Reduced Emissions by Electrifying New Buses Act or the GREEN Buses Act</strong></p> <p>This bill limits eligibility for certain grants that support projects to reduce emissions of public transportation vehicles.</p> <p>Current law permits the use of the grants for (1) projects related to both low- and zero-emission vehicles, and (2) constructing new and improving existing public transportation facilities to accommodate such vehicles. This bill limits the use of the grants to (1) projects related to no-emission vehicles, and (2) improving existing public transportation facilities.</p> <p>The bill also sets out additional criteria that apply to the grants. For example, the bill specifies the minimum number of buses that must be procured through a grant.

 <p><strong>Free Peng Shuai Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the President to impose property- and visa-blocking sanctions on any foreign individual associated with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) who has materially assisted China's government in the disappearance of Peng Shuai, including the president of the IOC. (Peng is a Chinese tennis star who raised allegations of sexual coercion against a retired senior Chinese leader.)</p> <p>The sanctions shall not apply to acts related to U.S. intelligence activities. The President may waive application of the sanctions if (1) doing so would be in U.S. national security interests, or (2) Peng has been released and may travel freely and her well-being has been independently confirmed by the U.S. government. <br> </p>

 <p><strong>Protecting Against Compromised Internet of Things Technology Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Department of Commerce to identify foreign persons that pose a threat to supply chain security for Internet of Things devices (i.e., any object or device that is connected to the internet and is not a laptop, cell phone, or other conventional technology device) for inclusion on the Entity List. This list identifies entities reasonably believed to be involved in, or to pose a significant risk of being or becoming involved in, activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.</p> <p>The bureau must periodically submit a list of any foreign persons identified as threats to Internet of Things device supply chains to the interagency committee that makes decisions regarding additions to, removals from, or other modifications to the Entity List. After receiving the bureau's list, the committee must vote on whether to add such foreign persons to the Entity List.</p> <p>A company added to the Entity List through this process may not receive any federal financial assistance, and the federal government may not contract with such a company for Internet of Things devices.</p>

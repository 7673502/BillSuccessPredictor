 <p><b>Transparency and Effective Accountability Measures for Veteran Caregivers Act or the TEAM Veteran Caregivers Act</b></p> <p>The bill revises the administration of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) caregiver programs. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to formally recognize caregivers of veterans by identifying any caregiver in the health record of the veteran. Such caregivers covered by the bill include those participating in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and those participating in the Program of General Caregiver Support Services.</p> <p>The bill requires the VA to notify veterans and their caregivers regarding any clinical determinations made relating to claims, tier reduction, or termination of assistance under, or eligibility for, the specified caregiver programs. The notifications must be standardized and contain specified details regarding the decisions.</p> <p>The bill also requires the VA to temporarily extend benefits under the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers for at least 90 days after the receipt of notice that a veteran is no longer clinically eligible for the program. Such an extension shall not apply to the termination of caregiver benefits (1) if the VA determines the caregiver committed fraud or abused or neglected the veteran, (2) if another primary provider or individual caregiver is designated within 90 days after the termination, (3) if the terminated individual moves out or abandons their relationship with the veteran, or (4) upon request of the caregiver or veteran. </p>

 <p><b>Ultrasound Informed Consent Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires abortion providers to conduct an ultrasound before performing an abortion. </p> <p>Specifically, before a woman gives informed consent to any part of an abortion, the abortion provider must</p> <ul> <li>perform an obstetric ultrasound on the pregnant woman;</li> <li>provide a simultaneous explanation of what the ultrasound is depicting;</li> <li>display the ultrasound images so the woman may view them; and</li> <li>provide a complete medical description of the images, including the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, cardiac activity if present and visible, and the presence of external members and internal organs if present and viewable.</li> </ul> <p>Providers are subject to civil actions and penalties for violations.</p> <p>The bill's ultrasound requirements do not apply in cases where a physical disorder, illness, or injury caused by the pregnancy endangers a woman's life. A woman is also not required to view the ultrasound images; nor may she or the provider be penalized if she declines to do so.</p>

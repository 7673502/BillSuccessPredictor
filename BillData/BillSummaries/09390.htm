 <p><strong>Stop Corporate Capture Act</strong></p> <p>This bill modifies the process for federal agency rulemaking.</p> <p>Specifically, it (1) requires interested parties who submit a study or research as part of a comment to a proposed rule to disclose the source of the funding for the study or research, (2) limits the use of the negotiated rulemaking process to government agencies, (3) provides statutory authority for the judicial principle that requires courts to defer to an agency's reasonable or permissible interpretation of a federal law when the law is silent or ambiguous (i.e., the <em>Chevron </em>doctrine), and (4) establishes an Office of the Public Advocate to support public participation in the rulemaking process.</p>

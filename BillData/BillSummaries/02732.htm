 <p><b>Domenic and Ed's Law</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to discharge a parent borrower's liability on Federal Family Education Loans if the student on whose behalf the parent incurred the loans becomes disabled. </p> <p>Specifically, ED must discharge the liability on loans that parents incurred on behalf of a student who (1) has become permanently and totally disabled, or (2) is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity due to a physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or has lasted or is expected to last continuously for at least 60 months. Under current law, ED is required to discharge a parent borrower's liability on these loans only if the student dies.</p>

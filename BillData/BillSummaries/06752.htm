 <p><strong>Data Elimination and Limiting Extensive Tracking and Exchange Act or the DELETE Act</strong><br> <br> This bill establishes a process for the deletion of personal information held by data brokers (i.e., entities that collect or obtain personal information for commercial purposes from individuals with whom they do not have a direct relationship).<br> <br> First, it requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules requiring data brokers to (1) register with the commission, (2) provide specified contact information, and (3) disclose certain data collection practices.<br> <br> Second, the commission must establish a centralized system to allow individuals to make a single request for the deletion of any of their personal information held by a data broker (or an affiliated legal entity). Each data broker must delete the personal information not later than 31 days after a request is made. An individual who submits a deletion request also must be added to a do-not-track list and registered data brokers are prohibited from collecting personal information about that individual.<br> <br> The bill provides for enforcement of these requirements by the commission.<br> </p>

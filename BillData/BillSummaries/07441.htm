 <p><strong>Acute Labor Shortage Solutions Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to exempt non-U.S. nationals (<em>aliens</em> under federal law) from certain annual caps on admission upon a determination that, due to an acute labor shortage, the needs of American businesses in certain sectors cannot be met with American workers. </p> <p>Such exemptions shall be available from FY2022 through FY2024 and may be available for an additional fiscal year if the Department of Labor determines such an extension is warranted due to U.S. labor shortages.</p>

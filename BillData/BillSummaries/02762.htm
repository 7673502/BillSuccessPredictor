 <p><b>Climate-Resilient International Development Optimization Act </b></p> <p>This bill directs agencies with direct international development programs and investments to incorporate climate resilience considerations into agency decision making. Agencies that participate in a multilateral entity must encourage the entity to incorporate climate-related risks into the decisions of the entity. The bill also establishes the Working Group on Climate-Resilient International Development in the Department of the Treasury to support such efforts. </p>

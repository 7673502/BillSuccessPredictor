 <p>This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration to update its regulations relating to the manufacture of human cells, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), including an update to the definition of <i>minimal manipulation</i>. (The regulations are commonly referred to as the<i> tissue rules</i>; HCT/Ps that are <i>minimally manipulated</i> and meet other criteria are not regulated as drugs, devices, or biologics and therefore are not subject to premarket review.)</p>

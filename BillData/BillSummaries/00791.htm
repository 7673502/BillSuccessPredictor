As part of this program, the CDC must provide grants and technical assistance to health departments to build their capacity to carry out such activities.</p> <p>Furthermore, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) must carry out a demonstration program to expand an existing program that links different federal data sets for statistical public health research, including research on food insecurity, housing instability, and other social determinants of health.

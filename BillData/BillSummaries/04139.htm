 <p><strong>Lori Jackson-Nicolette Elias Domestic Violence Survivor Protection Act</strong></p> <p>This bill makes changes to the federal statutory framework that prohibits the shipment, transport, receipt, or possession of firearms or ammunition by an individual who is subject to a qualifying domestic violence court order.</p> <p>Under current law, a qualifying domestic violence court order must meet certain requirements, including to (1) be issued after a hearing of which the individual had notice and an opportunity to participate; and (2) restrain the individual from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner (i.e., a current or former spouse, a co-parent of a child, or a current or former cohabitant) or the child of an intimate partner. </p> <p>This bill expands the scope of qualifying domestic violence court orders to include an order that</p> <ul> <li>is issued after an ex parte hearing (i.e., a hearing with only one party present);</li> <li>restrains the individual from harassing, stalking, or threatening a dating partner or former dating partner; or</li> <li>restrains the individual from intimidating a witness.</li> </ul> <p>Current law also prohibits an individual who is convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms or ammunition. These restrictions generally only apply to spouses, co-parents, and cohabitants, and to offenses that involve physical force or deadly weapons. This bill expands the scope of these restrictions to include dating partners and offenses that involve stalking.</p> <p>Finally, the bill authorizes grants for state, local, and tribal governments to remove firearms and take other steps after a domestic violence court order is issued. </p>

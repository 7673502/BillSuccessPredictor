 <p><b>Humane Retirement Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires animal care committees at certain federal agencies conducting biomedical or behavioral research to make reasonable efforts to find parties to adopt dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs that have been retired from research. Prior to euthanizing, the animal care committee must assess the temperament of any such animal to determine whether it is suitable for adoption and, if so, make reasonable efforts to arrange for an adoption.</p>

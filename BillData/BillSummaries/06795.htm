 <p><b>Short-Term Detention Standards Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to make every effort to ensure that apprehended individuals are given access to appropriate temporary shelter, bathrooms and shower facilities, water, appropriate nutrition, hygiene, personal grooming items, and sanitation needs. Currently, CBP is only required to make every effort to provide food and water.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office must carry out regular and unannounced inspections of CBP processes and share such information with Congress. CBP may not prevent Members of Congress or staff from accessing CBP facilities for oversight purposes, nor may CBP make temporary modifications to alter what a visiting Member of Congress may observe.</p>

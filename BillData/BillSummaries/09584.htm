 <p><b>Accessible Care by Curbing Excessive lawSuitS Act of 2022 or the ACCESS Act of 2022</b><br> <br> This bill establishes rules for health care lawsuits where some amount of coverage or care was provided or paid for by a federal program, regardless of the number of other parties to the claim.<br> <br> The bill sets a three-year maximum statute of limitations from the date of the injury, subject to specific exceptions. Further, noneconomic damages (e.g., damages for pain and suffering) are limited to a maximum of $250,000. The bill permits courts to supervise and limit contingent fees paid to attorneys and sets a maximum contingent fee percentage based on a downward sliding scale as a damages increase.<br> <br> The bill permits either party to introduce evidence of collateral source benefits (e.g., workers&rsquo; compensation programs, accident insurance coverage, or other future benefit). Statements by a health care provider expressing fault, sympathy, or apology are, however, inadmissible as evidence of liability.<br> <br> Additionally, a plaintiff must give 90 days&rsquo; notice to the health care provider before filing a lawsuit. When filing a health care lawsuit, plaintiffs also must simultaneously submit an affidavit in support of the claim from a health care professional who meets the standards for an expert witness that are provided in the bill.<br> <br> This bill generally does not preempt state laws that impose additional limits on health care liability claims.</p>

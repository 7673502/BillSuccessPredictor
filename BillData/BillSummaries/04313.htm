 <p><b>Small Refinery Exemption Clarification Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill states that a small refinery may submit a petition to the Environmental Protection Agency for an exemption from the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Program only if that refinery has received an exemption continuously since 2011. Thus, small refineries may not request extensions of exemptions if previous exemptions are already expired.</p>

 <p><b>Transparency of Hospital Billing Act</b></p> <p>This bill repeals certain exceptions to site-neutral payments with respect to Medicare payments to an off-campus outpatient department of a health care provider. It also requires providers to use separate, unique health identifiers when submitting a claim to a health insurance issuer for services provided at an off-campus outpatient department.</p>

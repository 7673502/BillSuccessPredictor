 <p><b>California Land Protection Act</b></p> <p>This bill delays hydraulic fracturing of oil or gas resources on certain federal lands in California.</p> <p>On December 12, 2019, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a record of decision for the Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the BLM Bakersfield Field Office. This bill nullifies the EIS until the BLM completes and circulates for public comment a new EIS. The new EIS must consider the environmental effects of all oil or gas development in the planning area.</p> <p>After the new EIS is published, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must review and publish comments regarding the EIS. If the EPA identifies significant environmental impacts or determines that there is insufficient information to assess the environmental impacts of all oil or gas development in the planning area, then the BLM must consult with the EPA before proceeding with federal oil or gas leasing in the planning area.</p>

 <p><b>Maritime Lien Reform Act</b> <b>of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill revises federal shipping laws governing maritime liability to prohibit (1) maritime liens (liens on vessels) from being imposed on state or federal fishing permits, or (2) civil actions to enforce maritime liens on the permits. A fishing permit is not considered to be part of a vessel, so it does not pass with a vessel upon the vessel's sale or transfer.</p>

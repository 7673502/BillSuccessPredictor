 <p><b>Telehealth Coverage and Payment Parity Act</b><br> <br> This bill requires private health insurance plans to cover certain services provided via telecommunications systems (i.e., telehealth). Specifically, the telehealth services must be deemed medically necessary by a health care provider and covered under the plan if provided in person. Plans must apply the same cost-sharing and reimbursement amounts that would otherwise apply to such services and may waive cost-sharing requirements for any services to diagnose or treat COVID-19, including via telehealth.</p>

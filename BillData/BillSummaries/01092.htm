 <p>This bill requires the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review any purchase by a Chinese entity of a controlling interest in a U.S. company deemed critical to national security, critical infrastructure, or of cultural significance. The President may approve such a purchase only if, among other things, the purchase price was not significantly affected by the COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the sale will not permit additional access to distribute propaganda or alter U.S. news and media consumption.</p> <p>The bill's provisions cease to have force or effect once the United States has substantially recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic.</p>

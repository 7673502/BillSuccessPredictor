 <p><strong>Mental Health Workforce and Language Access Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) two demonstration programs to increase access to mental health services provided in languages other than English at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). In carrying out the programs, HHS must give preference to FQHCs at which at least 20% of the patients are best served in a language other than English.</p> <p>First, HHS must provide National Health Service Corps (NHSC) loan repayments to mental health care providers who agree to serve their period of obligated service in an FQHC. HHS may provide enhanced payments to those who serve in an FQHC with non-English language needs. (The NHSC is a scholarship and student loan repayment program for eligible health care providers who agree to work in areas with a shortage of primary care, dental care, and mental health care providers.)</p> <p>Second, HHS must award grants to FQHCs for recruiting and retaining mental health care providers who are fluent in a language other than English.</p>

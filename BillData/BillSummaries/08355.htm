 <p><b>Closing Loopholes and Ending Asylum Abuse Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill imposes restrictions on noncitizens (<i>aliens</i> under federal law) applying for asylum, authorizes asylum seekers to apply for asylum abroad, and requires applicants to apply abroad in certain instances.</p> <p>For example, the bill requires a refugee's persecution or well-founded fear of persecution to stem from a government (or affiliated entity), whereas currently the persecution does not have to stem from a government. The bill also requires an applicant who passes through another country with a U.S. diplomatic mission that processes asylum claims to apply for asylum while physically in that country.</p>

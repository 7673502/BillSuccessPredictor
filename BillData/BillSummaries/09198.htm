 <p>This bill generally requires fiduciaries of employer-sponsored retirement plans to make investment decisions based only on pecuniary factors (i.e., factors that a fiduciary prudently determines are expected to have a material effect on the risk and return of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons consistent with the plan's policies and objectives).</p> <p>The bill allows nonpecuniary factors to be considered when selecting investment options for certain participant-directed retirement plans if specified requirements are met (e.g., the investment option is not a default investment). </p> <p>Further, if a plan includes investment options based on nonpecuniary factors, it also must include investment options that are not based on any such factors.</p>

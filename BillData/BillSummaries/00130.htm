 <p><strong>Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Storage Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes a federal statutory framework to regulate the storage of firearms and ammunition on residential premises.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires firearms and ammunition on residential premises to be safely stored if a minor is likely to gain access without permission or if an individual who resides at the residence is ineligible to possess a firearm.</p> <p>The firearms and ammunition must be safely stored in one of two ways: (1) secured, unloaded, and separated in a safe and locked with a trigger lock; or (2) off the premises at a storage facility or gun range. Safes, trigger locks, and storage facilities must be certified by the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p> <p>Finally, an individual who violates the safe storage requirements is subject to penalties&#8212;criminal penalties if the violation results in the discharge of a firearm, or civil penalties if the violation does not result in the discharge of a firearm.

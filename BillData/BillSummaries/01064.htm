 <p><b>Cable Transparency Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies the term and termination of cable franchises.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill provides that a cable franchise shall continue without any requirement for an operator to renew such franchise until the date the franchise is revoked or terminated. Under current law, a cable operator must submit a proposal for renewal of the franchise to the franchising authority.</p> <p>The bill prohibits generally (1) a franchising authority from revoking a franchise, (2) a cable operator from terminating a franchise, or (3) the revocation or termination of a franchise by operation of law. However, a cable operator may terminate a franchise by submitting a written request to the franchising authority for the revocation of such franchise, and a franchising authority may revoke a franchise if it (1) finds that the cable operator has knowingly and willfully failed to meet a material requirement of the franchise, (2) provides the cable operator an opportunity to cure such failure, and (3) does not waive or acquiesce to the failure to meet the requirement.</p> <p>Further, during a franchise period, a cable operator may obtain the elimination or modification of a franchise requirement by submitting a request for such elimination or modification to the franchising authority. The franchising authority shall grant such request if the cable operator demonstrates good cause and shows that the services required by the franchise will be maintained.</p>

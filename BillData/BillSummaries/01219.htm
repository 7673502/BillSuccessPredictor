 <p><strong>ABLE Age Adjustment Act</strong></p> <p>This bill increases from 26 to 46 the age&nbsp;threshold for tax-favored ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) accounts. (ABLE accounts are designed to enable individuals with disabilities to save for and pay for disability-related expenses. To establish an account, an individual must have a qualifying impairment that began before the individual attained the age threshold.)</p>

 <p><b>Dental Care for Our Troops Act</b></p> <p>This bill allows the Department of Defense (DOD) to establish a premium-free dental plan for members of the Selected Reserve. Participants in this dental plan may not be charged copays for services covered by the plan. (Current law requires DOD to offer a dental plan to members of the Selected Reserve, but the plan has premiums and copays.) <br> </p>

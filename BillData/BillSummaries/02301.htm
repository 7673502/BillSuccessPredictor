 <p><strong>Automatic Voter Registration Act</strong></p> <p>This bill provides for automatic voter registration of individuals through state motor vehicle authorities.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires each state motor vehicle authority, upon receiving specified identifying information regarding an individual who requests services from the authority, to transmit the identifying information to the appropriate state election official. The state election official must then notify the individual that the individual shall be automatically registered to vote in federal elections unless the individual declines to be registered to vote, does not meet voter registration eligibility requirements, or is already registered to vote. The bill provides an individual with a 21-calendar day period to opt out of automatic voter registration.</p> <p>A state may only use identifying information regarding an individual's citizenship status for determining whether the individual is eligible to vote in federal elections.</p>

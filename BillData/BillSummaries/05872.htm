 <p><strong>Natural Cosmetics Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue a final rule defining the terms <em>natural</em> and <em>naturally derived ingredient</em> with respect to cosmetics (including personal care products). It also prohibits the sale of a cosmetic that includes these terms on its packaging or labeling unless the cosmetic meets the definitions established under this bill. </p> <p>The FDA must issue the final rule within two years of this bill's enactment. </p> <p>When developing the definitions, the FDA must (1) consider how each ingredient in a cosmetic is processed; (2) consider any impurities that would adversely impact human health; and (3) base the definitions on relevant scientific data, including data on consumers' understanding of such terms when applied to cosmetics.</p>

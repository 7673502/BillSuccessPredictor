 <p><strong>Puerto Rico Nutrition Assistance Fairness Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill sets out a process to enable Puerto Rico to participate as a state in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Under current law, a state receives SNAP funding based on the number of participating households in the state whereas Puerto Rico receives a block grant to fund its nutrition assistance programs instead of participating in SNAP.</p>

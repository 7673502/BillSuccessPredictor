 <p><strong>COVID-19 Vaccine Accountability Act</strong></p> <p>This bill excludes manufacturers of a mandated COVID-19 vaccine from certain liability protections that apply to manufacturers of medical countermeasures (i.e., medical products that may be used to treat, prevent, or diagnose conditions associated with emerging infectious diseases or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agents). It also retroactively limits to $10,000 the liability of the United States for a death or injury caused by a COVID-19 vaccine administered on or after January 1, 2020.</p>

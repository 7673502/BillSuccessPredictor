 <p><strong>Pediatric Access to Critical Healthcare Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award grants to children's hospitals and other providers that predominately treat individuals under 21 for improving pediatric health care infrastructure. In awarding the grants, HRSA must prioritize recipients that serve significant numbers of patients receiving medical assistance through Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program or children from other underserved groups.</p>

 <p><b>Veterans' Right to Breathe Act</b></p> <p>This bill provides a presumption of service-connection to burn pit-exposed veterans for certain diseases. Under a presumption of service-connection, specific conditions diagnosed in certain veterans are presumed to have been caused by the circumstances of their military service. Health care benefits and disability compensation may then be awarded. A burn pit-exposed veteran is a veteran who was supporting a contingency operation on or after January 1, 1990, and was stationed at a location where an open burn pit (an area used for burning solid waste in open air without equipment) was used.</p>

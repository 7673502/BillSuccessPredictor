 <p><b>Sovereign Debt Contract Capacity Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of the Treasury to instruct the U.S. Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund to advocate for the fund to promote international standards and best practices with respect to sovereign debt contracts and to provide technical assistance to fund members. Such assistance should focus on lower middle-income countries in order to enhance their capacity to evaluate the legal and financial terms of sovereign debt contracts with private sector creditors.</p>

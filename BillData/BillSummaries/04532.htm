 <p><b>Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to make grants to states for demonstration projects that provide wage subsidies to enable low-income individuals to enter and retain employment.</p> <p>States may use grant funds to subsidize an individual's wages for up to 12 months. The subsidy may be up to 50% of an individual's wages. Individuals are eligible for subsidized wages if they (1) are recipients of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families or similar state assistance or a noncustodial parent of a child receiving such assistance, and (2) are unemployed when the subsidy begins or have an income below 200% of the poverty line.</p> <p>States must ensure that participants in subsidized job programs do not displace current workers.</p> The ACF must reserve funding to carry out this bill from amounts in the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs.

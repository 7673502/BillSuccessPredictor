 <p><b>Veterans Medical Legal Partnerships Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a grant program to support the establishment of medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) that provide legal expertise and services to veterans, with a particular focus on veterans whose medical needs put them at risk of recidivism, reoffending, or becoming victim to a crime. The bill also permits (1) the Department of Justice to give preference, when awarding grants for veteran treatment courts, to applicants that plan to work with MLPs; and (2) the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish MLPs in its facilities.</p>

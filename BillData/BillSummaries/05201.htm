 <p>This bill requires the Department of Defense to establish and maintain a database that contains current contact information for the next of kin of members of the Armed Forces. A commander of the service member's unit in a grade higher than O-5 must be authorized to access the contact information, regardless of whether the member served under the commander. Individuals named in the database are authorized to elect whether or not they want to be contacted by an officer.</p>

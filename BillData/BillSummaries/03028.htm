 <p><strong>LPOE Modernization Trust Fund Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes the Land Port of Entry Modernization Trust Fund and addresses other issues related to U.S. ports of entry.</p> <p>The bill transfers specified amounts, including a portion of certain collected customs fees, to the trust fund each year. It also requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of State to collect certain surcharges related to immigration and land border inspections, with a portion of the surcharges to be deposited into the trust fund.

 <p><b>Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services for Success Act</b></p> <p>This bill renames the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program as the Jobs and Opportunity with Benefits and Services (JOBS) program, reauthorizes the program through FY2027, and makes changes relating to work requirements for beneficiaries.</p> <p>States providing aid under the program shall create an individual opportunity plan for each beneficiary.

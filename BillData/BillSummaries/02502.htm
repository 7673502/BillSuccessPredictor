 <p><strong>Equal Pay for Servicewomen Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to address out-of-pocket cost inequities for military service uniforms. Specifically, the bill requires DOD to implement the four recommendations made by the Government Accountability Office in its report titled<em> Military Service Uniforms DOD Could Better Identify and Address Out-of-Pocket Cost Inequities</em> (GAO-21-120). The recommendations made in the report are related to reducing differences in out-of-pocket costs incurred by enlisted service members across the services and by gender.</p> <p>The bill requires DOD to prescribe regulations to ensure that</p> <ul> <li>out-of-pocket uniform costs to officers or enlisted members may not exceed costs to other officers or members in their branch solely based on gender; and</li> <li> if a change to a uniform affects only officers or enlisted members of one gender, the officers or members must be entitled to an allowance equal to the out-of-pocket cost related to the change.</li> </ul> <p>DOD must provide a one-time allowance to female officers and enlisted members in an amount based on gender disparities in out-of-pocket uniform costs during the past 10 years and proportional to the length of service of the officer or member.</p>

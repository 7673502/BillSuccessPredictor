 <p><strong>Veterans' Cyber Risk Awareness Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to conduct a communications and outreach campaign to educate veterans about <em>cyber risks</em>. These risks can include disinformation, identity theft, scams, and fraud spread via the internet or social media.</p> <p>Additionally, the VA must seek to enter an agreement with a federally funded research and development corporation to perform a study that assesses (1) the vulnerability of veterans to cyber risks, (2) the availability and efficacy of resources to assist veterans in combatting such risks, and (3) the efficacy of the VA's outreach campaign. The study must also recommend ways the VA can reduce cyber risks to veterans.<br> </p>

 <p><b>Veteran Deportation Prevention and Reform Act</b></p> <p>This bill provides protections from deportation for noncitizen veterans and contains other related provisions.</p> <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) must identify each individual in removal proceedings who is a member of the Armed Forces, a veteran, or a noncitizen spouse or minor child of such an individual. That individual may not be removed until (1) ICE has transferred that individual's case files to an advisory committee created under this bill, and (2) that committee has provided recommendations as to the outcome of the case. </p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall create a system to share information across various agencies about noncitizen veterans who may be subject to removal to ensure that such a veteran's military service is taken into consideration in immigration-related cases. DHS shall also create a system for (1) identifying noncitizens who are or may be veterans, and (2) collecting data relating to such noncitizens who are in removal proceedings or may have been removed. </p> <p>DHS and the Department of Defense must jointly carry out a program to naturalize a noncitizen (and the noncitizen's spouse and minor children) who serves on active duty in the Armed Forces and is not otherwise ineligible for citizenship if that noncitizen submits an application. </p> <p>DHS shall also establish a program for eligible noncitizen veterans (generally those not convicted for certain serious crimes) to obtain permanent resident status. Similarly, the Department of Justice shall provide permanent resident status to such an eligible veteran in removal proceedings or subject to a final order of removal. </p>

 <p><b>Preventing a Patronage System Act or the PPSA Act</b></p> <p>This bill prohibits executive agency positions in the competitive service from being placed in the excepted service, unless such positions are placed in Schedules A through E as in effect on September 30, 2020. The bill also prohibits positions in the excepted service from being placed in any schedule other than the aforementioned schedules.</p> <p>On October 21, 2020, the President issued an executive order titled <i>Creating Schedule F in the Excepted Service</i>. The order places executive agency positions that are of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character, and that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition, under a new schedule in the excepted service (Schedule F) instead of the competitive service. The order also requires any such positions in the excepted service to be reclassified to Schedule F.</p>

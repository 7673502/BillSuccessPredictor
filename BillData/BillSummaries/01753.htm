 <p><b>Improving Access to Nutrition Act of 20<strong>21</strong></b></p> <p>This bill repeals certain work requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program). </p> <p>The requirements apply to able-bodied adults who are ages 18-49 and have no dependent children. Individuals who do not meet certain work requirements are generally prohibited from receiving more than 3 months of SNAP benefits over a 36-month period. Under current law, some of the work requirements under SNAP are temporarily suspended due to COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019).</p>

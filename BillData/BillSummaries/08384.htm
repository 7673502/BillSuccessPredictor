 <p><strong>Standing with Moms Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to disseminate information about pregnancy-related resources.</p> <p>Specifically, HHS must maintain a public website (life.gov) that lists such resources that are available through federal, state, and local governments and private entities.</p> <p>Additionally, HHS must maintain on its website a portal that provides a user, based on the user's responses to a series of questions, tailored information about pregnancy resources available in the user's zip code and risks related to abortion. HHS must develop a plan to conduct follow-up outreach to users of the portal (if the user consents to the outreach). States must recommend resources that meet criteria set by HHS for including through the portal. HHS may award grants to states to establish or support a system that aggregates resources to include on the portal.</p> <p>Further, the Health Resources and Services Administration must share information about life.gov and the portal through the Maternal Mental Health Hotline.</p> <p>HHS must also ensure that the life.gov website and hotline are available to families who speak languages other than English.</p> <p>The bill excludes from life.gov, the portal, and the hotline resources provided by entities that (1) perform, induce, refer for, or counsel in favor of abortions; or (2) financially support such entities.</p> <p>The bill also requires HHS to report on traffic to life.gov and the portal, gaps in services available to pregnant and postpartum individuals, and related matters.</p>

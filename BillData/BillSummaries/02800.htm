 <p><strong>Working to Integrate Networks Guaranteeing Member Access Now Act or the WINGMAN Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide veterans with the option to grant read-only access to their records in the databases of the Veterans Benefits Administration to covered congressional employees. The covered congressional employees must be employed in the office of the Member of Congress who represents the district where the veteran resides.</p> <p>Under the bill, a covered congressional employee is (1) a permanent, full-time employee of a Member of Congress who is responsible for assisting constituents with federal agencies and departments; (2) designated by the Member; and (3) someone who satisfies the criteria required by the VA for recognition as an agent or attorney. However, the bill specifies that a covered congressional employee may not be recognized as an agent or attorney with respect to veterans' benefit claims.</p>

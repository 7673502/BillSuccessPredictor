 <p><b>Making Obligations Right by Enlarging Payments In Lieu of Taxes Act or the MORE PILT Act</b></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of the Interior to develop a modeling tool that calculates the approximate market value of land covered by the payments in lieu of taxes (PILT) program and the approximate amount of local tax revenue the land would generate if privately owned. The PILT program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.</p> <p>Interior must annually report on the value of land covered by the PILT program, the tax revenue the land would generate if privately owned, and how PILT payments could more accurately reflect that tax revenue.</p>

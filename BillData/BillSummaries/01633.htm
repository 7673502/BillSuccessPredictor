 <p><strong>Public Service Loan Forgiveness Inclusion Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill allows the first 60 monthly payments made by a borrower under a graduated repayment or extended repayment plan to become qualifying payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. However, the borrower must transfer to an eligible repayment plan, such as an income-based or standard repayment plan, for the remaining 60 monthly payments made under the PSLF program.</p>

 <p><strong>Flexibility for Workers Education Act</strong></p> <p>This bill excludes from hours worked certain voluntary training that occurs outside an employee's regular working hours. Such training does not count as hours worked even if it is offered by the employer, provided that an employee's working conditions are not adversely affected by choosing not to participate and the employee does not perform any productive work for the employer during the training.</p>

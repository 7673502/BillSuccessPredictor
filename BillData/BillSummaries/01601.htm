 <p> <strong>Pandemic Relief for Working Seniors Act of 2021</strong> <p>This bill increases the amount of income that individuals who are younger than full retirement age may earn in taxable years 2020 and 2021 without reductions to their Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) benefits. <p>Under current law, these individuals are subject to the retirement earnings test, which reduces their OASDI benefits if their earnings exceed an annual limit. This limit is set at $18,240 for 2020 and $18,960 for 2021 for most individuals. However, the limit for individuals who reach full retirement age in 2020 or 2021 is $48,600 or $50,520, respectively. <p>This bill increases the applicable income limits to equal the amount of the contribution and benefit base. The contribution and benefit base serves as a cap on both the amount of earnings subject to the Social Security payroll tax and the amount of earnings used to calculate benefits. It is set at $137,700 for 2020 and $142,800 for 2021.

 <p><strong>Threatened Species Protection Improvement Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill provides statutory authority for the rule published on August 27, 2019, by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service relating to threatened species. The rule requires species listed as threatened after the issuance of the rule to be given protections tailored to the species' needs. Prior to the rule, threatened species were automatically provided with most of the protections that are provided to endangered species.</p>

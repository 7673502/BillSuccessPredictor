 <p><strong>21st Century Dyslexia Act</strong></p> <p>This bill addresses the education of children with disabilities, with a particular focus on children with dyslexia.</p> <p>Currently, dyslexia is listed as one of the disabilities under the definition of <em>specific learning disability</em> in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This bill instead removes dyslexia from the definition of <em>specific learning disability</em> and establishes a stand-alone definition for <em>dyslexia</em> within IDEA.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill defines <em>dyslexia</em> for purposes of IDEA as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader, most commonly caused by a difficulty in the phonological processing (the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken language), which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell.</p> <p> Additionally, the bill requires a local educational agency or other agency, in determining eligibility for or providing an accommodation or service under IDEA, to provide equal access to (1) children from low-income families or from families with low socioeconomic status, and (2) other children.</p>

 <p><strong>America Reopens Act</strong></p> <p>This bill restricts the implementation and enforcement of various COVID-19 response measures in transportation, education, and other areas.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill prohibits any federal agency or federally funded entity from requiring that U.S. citizens or permanent residents wear face coverings or show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or testing when using public conveyances (e.g., planes or trains) or transportation hubs when traveling domestically or returning from foreign countries. Further, Canadian and Mexican nationals may enter the United States for business through land ports of entry without regard to their COVID-19 vaccination status.</p> <p>The bill also restricts federal funding of public institutions of higher education unless the institution (1) makes in-person instruction available to all students; and (2) allows students to opt out of COVID-19 requirements concerning vaccination, testing, and face covering. This restriction does not apply to distance education programs offered for reasons unrelated to COVID-19 or certain health-related educational programs. Additionally, the Department of Education must provide grants to parents for certain educational expenses, such as tuition at a private school, if their child lacks access to in-person instruction at a public elementary or secondary school due to COVID-19.</p> <p>The bill also prohibits the use of federal funds to implement or enforce a system or plan for verifying an individual's COVID-19 vaccination status, such as vaccine passports.</p>

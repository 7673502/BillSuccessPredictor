 <p><strong>Critical Mineral Access Act</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation to provide support to high-income economy countries for developing and processing specified critical materials if such support furthers U.S. national security interests. Critical materials include, for example, rare earth elements, aluminum, and uranium.</p> <p>A <em>high-income economy country</em> is one with a per capita gross national income (GNI) that exceeds $12,695 for 2021. Current law limits the corporation's activities to facilitating the economic development of countries with a per capita GNI below that amount.</p> <p><br> </p>

 <p><strong>Community Disaster Resilience Zones Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the President to continue to maintain a natural disaster hazard assessment program that develops and maintains publicly available products to show the risk of natural hazards across the United States.</p> <p>Such products shall show the risk of natural hazards and include ratings and data for loss exposure, social vulnerability, community resilience, and any other element determined by the President.</p> <p>The President shall (1) review the underlying methodology of any product that is a natural disaster hazard risk assessment, and (2) consider including additional data in any product that is a natural disaster hazard risk assessment. Additionally, the President must conduct such reviews to evaluate and update the assessments at least every five years.</p> <p>Using the reviewed assessments, the President must periodically identify and designate community disaster resilience zones (CDRZs), which shall be (1) the 50 census tracts assigned the highest individual hazard risk ratings; and (2) in each state, not less than 1% of census tracts that are assigned a high risk rating, taking into consideration specified geographic balance.</p> <p>The President may provide financial, technical, or other assistance to an eligible entity (a state, Indian tribal government, or local government) that plans to perform a resilience or mitigation project within, or that primarily benefits, a CDRZ.</p>

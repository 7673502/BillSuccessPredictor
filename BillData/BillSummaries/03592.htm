 <p><b>Adopt the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model Act or the Adopt GREET Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to update the methodology used in life-cycle analyses of greenhouse gas emissions that result from the production and use of corn-based ethanol and biodiesel fuel. The EPA must update its methodology within 90 days and every five years thereafter. In the first update, the EPA must adopt the most recent Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model (commonly referred to as the GREET model) developed by Argonne National Laboratory. </p>

 <p><strong>Preventing Personal Conflicts of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act</strong></p> <p>This bill addresses conflicts of interest in federal acquisition.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill directs the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council to (1) expand the scope of rules to prevent personal conflicts of interest beyond the limited types of functions or services that are currently addressed in a specified part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and (2) revise the FAR to address the functions and services that give rise to heightened concerns for personal conflicts of interest.</p> <p>The bill similarly expands the scope of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy's standard policy to prevent personal conflicts of interest by contractor employees performing relevant acquisition functions for or on behalf of a federal agency or department.</p> <p>The bill prohibits contractors, contractor employees, and subcontractors and their employees from providing services supporting the regulatory, policymaking, or adjudicative functions of an agency at the same time that the contractor, employees, or subcontractor provides services to an entity regulated by, or having non-routine business before, the agency, except where there is a compelling reason, as documented in writing.</p> <p>The Department of Justice may bring a civil action in U.S. district court for violations of this bill.</p>

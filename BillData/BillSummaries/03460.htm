 <p><strong>State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill exempts antitrust actions brought by states from the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation's processes regarding transfers and consolidations of cases. Under current law, civil actions that are pending in different federal courts, and that involve common questions of fact, may be transferred to a single court district for coordinated or consolidated trial proceedings. Current law exempts antitrust actions from consolidation or transfers only if they are brought by the United States. <br> </p> </p>

 <p><b>Student Loan Disclosure Modernization Act</b></p> <p>This bill&nbsp;requires loan disclosure forms for&nbsp;federal student loans&nbsp;to be written in plain language, thus enabling borrowers to understand loan terms, total costs of loans, and estimated monthly repayments. Borrowers must&nbsp;acknowledge in writing that they have read the form before the loans are issued.</p>

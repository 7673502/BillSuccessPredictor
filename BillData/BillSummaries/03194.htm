 <p><b>Fairness for Farm Workers Act</b> </p> <p>This bill extends overtime pay protections to agricultural workers.</p> <p> The bill requires employers, beginning in 2022, to compensate agricultural workers for hours worked in excess of their regular hours (i.e., 55 hours in 2022, 50 hours in 2023, 45 hours in 2024, and 40 hours in 2025) at not less than one and one-half times the employee's regular rate. For employers with 25 or fewer employees, the overtime pay requirements begin in 2025. These overtime pay requirements do not apply, as under current law, to employees who are the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer's immediate family. </p> <p>The bill also repeals the exemption from overtime pay requirements for employers in various agriculture-related industries, including certain small farms, irrigation projects, sugar processing, and cotton ginning and compressing.</p>

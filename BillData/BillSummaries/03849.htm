 <p><strong>Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching Act of 2021 or the ACCESS Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill requires large online platforms (e.g., YouTube, Salesforce) to facilitate consumers and businesses switching from one platform to another.</p> <p>Specifically, the platforms must maintain interfaces that (1) securely transfer user data to other platforms (i.e., portability), and (2) allow other platforms to connect and communicate with their systems (i.e., interoperability).</p> <p>The bill provides the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice with the authority to designate specific platforms to which these requirements apply. After a platform is designated, the FTC must issue standards of interoperability specific to the platform. A platform may not change its interoperability interface without petitioning the FTC, and the platform must provide to competing businesses documentation for accessing the interface.</p> <p>Further, the FTC must establish a technical committee to assist with the implementation of these requirements.</p> <p>The bill provides the FTC with authority to enforce these requirements including through recovery of civil penalties and injunctive relief.</p>

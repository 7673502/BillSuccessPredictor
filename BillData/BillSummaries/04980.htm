 <p>This bill directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to ensure that any individual traveling on a flight that departs from or arrives to an airport inside the United States or a U.S. territory is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. The TSA must also ensure that there is an exception to the requirement for an individual who is ineligible or medically unable to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>

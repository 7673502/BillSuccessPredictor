 <p><b>Transparency in Energy Production Act of 2020</b></p> <p>This bill requires certain disclosures by entities seeking a lease or holding a lease to develop renewable energy operations or fossil fuel operations on public lands or any operation using any right-of-way or special use permit that would cross public lands or national forests that would facilitate fossil fuel development. The disclosures are those described in the Sustainability Accounting Standard for the Renewable Resources &amp; Alternative Energy Sector or the Extractives &amp; Mineral Processing Sector.</p> <p>Every two years, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture must report to Congress on such operations, including greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, water management, biodiversity impacts, production, and the number of sites. For renewable energy operations on public lands, the report must include greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the production of the same amount of energy using fossil fuels.</p>

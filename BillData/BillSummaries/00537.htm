 <p><b>Supplemental Security Income Equality Act</b> <p>This bill extends the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. This is a federal program designed to help aged, blind, and disabled individuals with limited income and resources meet basic needs. When Congress created the SSI program in 1972, it excluded these territories. <p>The Social Security Administration may waive or modify statutory requirements relating to the provision of benefits as necessary to adapt the SSI program to each territory. <p>This bill also eliminates a limit on payments from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program and other Department of Health and Human Services programs to the territories.

 <p><strong>Choice Neighborhoods Initiative Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill allows the Department of Housing and Urban Development to make competitive grants to local governments, public housing agencies, or nonprofit entities owning a major housing project to implement transformational housing programs in eligible neighborhoods with a concentration of extreme poverty and severely distressed housing. A program must, among other requirements, allow residents of public or assisted housing displaced by such a program to return to the replacement housing provided under the program.</p>

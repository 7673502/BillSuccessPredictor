 <p>This bill amends the West Los Angeles Leasing Act of 2016 to expand the definition of <em>l</em><em>and use revenue</em> to include any funds received as compensation for an easement authorized on, above, or under lands at the Department of Veterans Affairs West Los Angeles Campus. Under current law, such revenues are then usable for purposes related to renovating and maintaining the land, facilities, and services at the campus.</p>

 <p><b>Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill specifies that product information that is exchanged between drug manufacturers and certain health care entities (e.g., formulary committees) about drug products before regulatory approval is not considered to be misbranding if it relates to the product's investigational use and meets other specified criteria. The Government Accountability Office must study the use and effects of such information. </p>

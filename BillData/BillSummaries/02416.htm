 <p><strong>Stop Hate Crimes Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill lowers the statutory burden of proof for showing intent with respect to a federal hate crime offense.</p> <p>Current law makes it unlawful to willfully cause bodily injury, or attempt to do so using a dangerous weapon, because of the actual or perceived protected characteristic (e.g., race) of a person. In 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that the<em> because of</em> standard requires proof that a person's actual or perceived protected characteristic was the sole motivating factor in the offense. </p> <p>This bill replaces the<em> because of </em>standard with a new standard. Specifically, willfully causing bodily injury, or attempting to do so using a dangerous weapon, is a hate crime offense if a person's actual or perceived protected characteristic was a contributory motivating factor in the offense.<br> </p>

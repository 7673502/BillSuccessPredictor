 <p><b>VA Hiring Enhancement Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies requirements and procedures related to the hiring of physicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).</p> <p>Specifically, the bill negates enforcement of a noncompete agreement that an applicant for a specified appointee position (e.g., physician) in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has entered into with a non-VA facility or party. As a condition of terminating the noncompete agreement, the physician must agree to serve at the VHA for one year or until the expiration of the noncompete agreement, whichever is later. </p> <p>The bill also authorizes the VA to offer a contingent physician's appointment to a person if the VA anticipates that the person will have completed a residency program leading to board eligibility in a specialty and met other requirements for the appointment within two years after the VA offer.</p> <p>Eligibility requirements for a VA physician's appointment are revised to require completion of a residency program rather than an internship.</p>

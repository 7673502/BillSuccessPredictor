 <p>This bill excepts quotations of fixed-income securities from rules requiring broker-dealers to review issuer information for accuracy before providing quotations for that issuer's security in the over-the-counter securities market. Fixed-income securities, such as bonds, provide returns in fixed periodic interest payments and return the principal at maturity.</p>

 <p><strong>End Prison Gerrymandering Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Commerce, beginning with the 2030 decennial census, to attribute an individual incarcerated in a correctional center to the individual's last place of residence before incarceration. Further, a state must treat such an individual's last place of residence in the state before incarceration as the individual's place of residence for purposes of congressional redistricting.</p>

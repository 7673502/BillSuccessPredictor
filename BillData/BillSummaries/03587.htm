 <p><strong>Requirements, Expectations, and Standard Procedures for Effective Consultation with Tribes Act or the RESPECT Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes tribal consultation procedures for federal agencies.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires federal agencies to consult with tribal governments (1) before undertaking any proposed federal activity or finalizing any federal regulatory action that may have a tribal impact, and (2) for all activities that would affect any part of federal land sharing a border with Indian land. <em>Tribal impact</em> refers to any federal action that may have an impact on tribal governments, including tribal cultural practices and tribal treaty-protected rights.</p> <p>Agencies must prepare tribal impact statements to identify potential tribal impacts of a proposed activity or action. Agencies must also make a good faith effort to identify areas that contain sacred sites important to tribal governments.</p> <p>The bill further outlines consultation requirements, including outreach and meeting arrangements. In general, the consultation shall conclude only upon the execution of a memorandum of agreement between the agency and the tribal government or the members of a designated tribal leader task force.</p> <p>Next, the bill requires agencies to take certain actions during the decision stage for a proposed activity (e.g., public comment) and for a regulatory action.</p> <p>Agencies must recognize and respect tribal self-government and sovereignty and grant tribal governments maximum discretion in the administration of federal statutes and regulations.</p> <p>Tribal governments may seek judicial review of a determination of an agency under this bill if the tribal government has exhausted all other administrative remedies.</p>

The center must coordinate stewardship, planning, assessment, and other functions for all federal nuclear forensics and attribution activities.</p> <p>Additionally, the NNSA must develop and implement a plan to modify its university-based research collaboration program to include the development of expertise in nuclear forensics in supporting scientific and engineering advancement in DOE defense and national security program areas.</p>

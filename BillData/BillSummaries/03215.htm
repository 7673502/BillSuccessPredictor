 <p><strong>Temporary Family Visitation Act</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes a new nonimmigrant visa classification for an alien temporarily entering the United States to visit a relative who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.</p> <p>The maximum period of stay for a family visitor visa shall be 90 days. An alien seeking such a visa must have health insurance for the duration of the stay.</p> <p>An alien who holds such a visa may not change to another nonimmigrant visa classification except in certain limited instances.</p> <p>If an alien has been approved for a family-based immigrant visa and is waiting for one to become available, the alien may obtain a family visitor visa if the alien meets the eligibility requirements.</p>

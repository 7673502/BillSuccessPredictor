 <p><b>Distillery Revitalization Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Small Business Administration to modify the Restaurant Revitalization Program, established to support food and beverage purveyors in response to COVID-19, to allow certain distilleries to participate in the program. </p> <p>To be program-eligible, a distillery must have at least 33% of revenue from on-site sales. However, certain states limit the percentage of revenue that a distillery may have from on-site sales to less than 33%. For a distillery located in such a state, the bill allows the distillery to use its combined revenue from on-site sales and sales to retailers for on-site sales to reach the 33% threshold.</p>

 <p><strong>Promoting Fair Lending to Small Businesses Act </strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to require reports from and conduct periodic examinations of certain nondepository business lenders. Specifically, the CFPB must assess these lenders' compliance with fair lending laws, obtain information about compliance systems or procedures, and detect risks to small businesses and to minority- and women-owned businesses. Under the bill, nondepository lenders include financial institutions that are not banks or credit unions but that are required to report under certain fair lending laws. </p>

 <p><b>Outpatient Surgery Quality and Access Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill establishes and modifies certain requirements relating to Medicare payments for ambulatory surgical center (ASC) services.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill (1) requires the payment system for ASC services to feature certain positive annual adjustments equivalent to those made with respect to hospital outpatient department (OPD) services; (2) revises quality reporting requirements to&nbsp;permit publicly available, side-by-side comparisons of quality measures for ASCs and OPDs in the same geographic area; and (3) requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), when excluding&nbsp;requested procedures from the list of those approved to be performed in ASCs, to cite specified reasons for doing so.</p> <p>With respect to excluding procedures from the approved list for ASCs, the CMS may not cite as a basis for exclusion that a procedure can only be reported using an unlisted surgical procedure code.&nbsp;(Physicians sometimes use unlisted codes when performing new procedures or services if no existing code is adequately descriptive.)</p> <p>The bill also limits the copayment amount for ASC services under Medicare to that of the inpatient hospital deductible.</p>

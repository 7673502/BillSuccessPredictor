 <p><b>Climate Change Resiliency Fund for America Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill provides support to address the impacts of climate change.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill authorizes the Department of the Treasury to issue up to $1 billion in climate change obligations (e.g., bonds) in a fiscal year, with bond proceeds going into the Climate Change Resiliency Fund established by this bill. The fund must be used for a program that finances projects that reduce the economic, social, and environmental impact of the adverse effects of climate change. A percentage of those funds must be used to benefit communities that experience disproportionate impacts from climate change.</p> <p>The Climate Change Advisory Commission, established by this bill, must provide recommendations and guidelines for the program and identify categories of the most cost-effective investments and projects that emphasize multiple benefits to commerce, human health, and ecosystems.</p>

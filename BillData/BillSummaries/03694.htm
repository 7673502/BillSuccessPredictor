 <p>This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit a report analyzing the impact on global COVID-19 vaccine access of a waiver of certain obligations held by nations who are members of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. (India and South Africa previously submitted a petition to suspend all intellectual property rights associated with COVID-19 innovations, such as vaccines.)</p> <p>Based on this report, the U.S. Trade Representative must oppose such elimination or waiver with respect to COVID-19 vaccines if HHS determines that the elimination or waiver will not materially increase global vaccine access or that it will have a negative impact on specified factors relating to access to, manufacture of, and investment in COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

 <p><b>Legal Aid for Americans Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a pro bono service requirement for law school graduates who borrow federal student loans for their graduate legal education.</p> <p>Specifically, such a borrower must agree to perform pro bono legal work for not fewer than 50 hours per year for three years after the borrower obtains a license to practice law in a state (or for three years after completing the program of study, for borrowers who already had a license to practice when they&nbsp;received the&nbsp;loan). The bill exempts certain individuals from this requirement, including a borrower who is employed in a public service job.</p>

 <p><b>Food before Fuel Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises the renewable fuel program to eliminate the annual renewable fuel standard.</p> <p>The existing standard requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel that is produced from renewable biomass to be blended into transportation fuel by 2022. The renewable fuel standard includes fuels that are produced from renewable biomass, such as corn.</p> <p>The bill would not affect the standards under the program for advanced biofuel, cellulosic biofuel, or biomass-based diesel.</p>

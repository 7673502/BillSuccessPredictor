 <p><b>Get the Lead Out Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires community water systems (i.e., public water systems that provide drinking water) to identify and replace lead service lines (e.g., pipes) and allows the systems to use assistance from drinking water state revolving funds to replace those lines.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires community water systems to submit to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by specified deadlines (1) plans to inventory and replace lead service lines, and (2) certifications that lead service lines have been replaced except for any line that is not owned by the system and for which the owner declined replacement.</p> <p>Community water systems must pay the full costs of all lead service line replacements and any filters required under their plans. Systems may incorporate into their base rates the costs of the line replacements and filters not fully covered by grants and other assistance.</p>

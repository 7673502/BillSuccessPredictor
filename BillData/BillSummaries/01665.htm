 <p><b>Employee Profit-Sharing Encouragement Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill denies the business tax deduction for the remuneration of highly-compensated corporate employees unless the corporation has average annual gross receipts of less than $25 million and maintains a plan for making qualified profit-sharing distributions to its employees. The bill defines <i>qualified profit-sharing distributions</i> as cash distributions under a written employer plan that gives employees who have been employed for at least one year a right to profit-sharing distributions and bases the amount of such distributions on the measure of the receipts, profit, revenues, or earnings of the employer.</p>

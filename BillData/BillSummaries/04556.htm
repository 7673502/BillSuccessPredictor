 <p><b>Energy Prices Require Including Climate Externalities Act of 2021 or the Energy PRICE Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to direct electric utilities to take greenhouse gas emissions into account when they set their rates for the wholesale sale of electricity. Specifically, if FERC determines that the rates do not incorporate the cost of such emissions to public health, safety, or welfare, then FERC must find that the rates are unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory, or preferential.</p>

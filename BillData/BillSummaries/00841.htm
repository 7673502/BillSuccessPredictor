 <p><b>Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2021 </b></p> <p>This bill allows the use of hemp, cannabidiol (i.e., CBD) derived from hemp, or any other ingredient derived from hemp in a dietary supplement, provided that the supplement meets other applicable requirements. (Currently, the Food and Drug Administration's position is that CBD products may not be sold as dietary supplements.)</p>

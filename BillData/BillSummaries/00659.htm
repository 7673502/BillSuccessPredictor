 <p><b>Repeal the Faircloth Amendment Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill repeals the limitation on the construction of new public housing units, commonly known as the Faircloth limit or the Faircloth amendment. Under current law, a public housing agency (PHA) is generally prohibited from using Department of Housing and Urban Development capital or operating funds to construct public housing units if doing so would result in a net increase to the number of public housing units owned, assisted, or operated by the PHA.</p>

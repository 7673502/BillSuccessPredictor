 <p><b>Readable Legislation Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill requires every bill or joint resolution that amends an existing section of an act to set forth the entire section, showing proposed changes to that section by appropriate typographical device. This eliminates the current practice of revising or amending a section of an act by mere reference to it.</p>

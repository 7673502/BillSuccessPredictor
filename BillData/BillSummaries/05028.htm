 <p><b>Information Sharing And Advanced Communication Alerting Act or the ISAAC Alerting Act</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Technological Advisory Council of the Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, to submit a report that identifies measures, barriers, and recommendations for implementing a 9&#8211;1&#8211;1 disability alerting system.</p> <p>The alerting system must allow an individual to register and create a profile associated with an individual who has a disability that includes information such as whether the individual is a wandering risk, nonverbal, or physically limited. The alerting system then transmits such information to public safety answering points to be conveyed to first responders.</p>

 <p><strong>Accelerating Rural Broadband Deployment Act</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the granting of an occupancy license to any person who requests access to a right-of-way that is owned by the federal government in order to place, construct, modify, or operate facilities for the provision of broadband service.</p> <p>Specifically, an executive agency with control over such a right-of-way may grant an occupancy license for the expansion of broadband service. An occupancy license may not have a duration of more than 30 years and may be automatically renewed. The granting agency must establish an annual license fee and make a decision regarding the issuance of the occupancy license within 60 days of receiving an application for a license. If the agency does not act on a request within 60 days, the application shall be considered granted.</p>

 <p><b>Addressing Care Timelines for Veterans Act or the ACT for Veterans Act</b></p> <p>This bill modifies the Veterans Community Care Program to extend the authorization period for emergency treatment in non-Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities. Specifically, the bill requires the VA to deem as authorized emergency care or services provided by a non-VA health care provider to a covered veteran if such veteran applies for authorization within 96 hours (currently 72 hours under VA regulations) of admission for care. Covered veterans are those who are enrolled in the VA health care system or those who are not enrolled but are eligible for care due to a service-connected disability.</p>

 <p><b>Public Service Loan Forgiveness Modernization Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises provisions related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.</p> <p>Specifically, the bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to establish and regularly update a comprehensive database identifying each qualified public service employer and each position offered by such employer that is a public service job. ED must also establish a process whereby an employer may submit a certification that it is a qualified public service employer.</p> <p>In addition, the bill prohibits ED from requiring a borrower to apply for and be denied loan cancellation pursuant to the PSLF program as a condition of eligibility for loan forgiveness under the Temporary Expanded Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

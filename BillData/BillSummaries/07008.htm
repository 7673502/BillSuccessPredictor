 <p><b>Pre-approval Information Exchange Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill specifies that economic, scientific, or other product support information that is exchanged between drug manufacturers and health care entities (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers) about drug products before regulatory approval is not considered to be misbranding or prohibited premarket promotion if it relates to the product's investigational use and meets other specified criteria. The Government Accountability Office must study the use and effects of such information. </p>

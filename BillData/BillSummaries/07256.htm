 <p><strong>Expediting Temporary Ratings for Veterans Act</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to modify its information technology systems to provide for the automatic processing of claims for temporary disability ratings for specified veterans (i.e., those who have a service-connected disability that requires hospital treatment or observation for a period in excess of 21 days).</p> <p>In providing for the automatic processing of claims, the VA must ensure that (1) medical evidence is obtained from its corporate data warehouse, (2) VA employees continue to determine eligibility for a temporary disability rating for the specified veterans, and (3) claims may be processed manually if the evidence of record is not sufficient to decide the claim or if the medical evidence is provided in an incompatible format.</p>

 <p><strong>Protect the Capitol Act of 2021</strong></p> <p>This bill places additional restrictions on deployments and other activities of the Capitol Police outside of the areas established by law for its jurisdiction.</p> <p>Current law allows the Capitol Police to deploy officers outside of its jurisdiction subject to prior notification and approval requirements. This bill restricts such a deployment to a defined, limited duration of no more than 30 days. </p> <p>Current law also provides exceptions to the prior notification and approval requirements if the purpose of a deployment is to respond to an imminent threat or emergency, provide protective services, or gather intelligence. This bill applies the 30-day limit to excepted deployments and requires that intelligence gathering deployments must be in response to a specific, identified threat to qualify for an exception.</p> <p>Additionally, the Capitol Police shall not establish or maintain a permanent office outside of the District of Columbia.</p>

 <p><strong>Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act of 2022</strong></p> <p>This bill reauthorizes programs to combat human trafficking and addresses related issues.</p> <p>The bill reauthorizes through FY2026 various programs, including (1) Department of State and Department of Justice activities to combat human trafficking internationally; and (2) the Angel Watch Center, a U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement program that notifies foreign countries of the pending arrival of certain convicted sex offenders.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services may carry out a program to prevent the re-exploitation of certain victims of trafficking by helping such individuals reintegrate into society and achieve self-sufficiency. </p> <p>The bill imposes additional requirements on states receiving federal payments for foster care maintenance or adoption assistance. Specifically, if a state agency has certain responsibilities pertaining to a missing child who is (or at risk of being) a trafficking victim, that agency must maintain regular communication and share information with law enforcement and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in efforts to safely recover the child.</p> <p>The Angel Watch Center must periodically obtain from each country in the visa waiver program a list of individuals from those countries who are required to register as sex offenders. </p> <p>The U.S. Agency for International Development must encourage integration of activities to counter human trafficking into its broader assistance programs. </p> <p>Federal agencies must ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that nightly lodgings booked in the United States for agency employees are made with establishments with procedures and policies to combat human trafficking.</p>

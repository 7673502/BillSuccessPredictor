 <p><b>Chiropractic Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill expands Medicare coverage of chiropractic services to include evaluation and management services, including examination and imaging services, and other functions provided by chiropractors, rather than only subluxation corrections through manual manipulation of the spine. The bill also allows chiropractors to enter into private contracts with Medicare beneficiaries.</p>

 <p><b>Cumulative Impacts Act of 2022</b></p> <p>This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether issuing or renewing certain permits under the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act will have cumulative impacts that will harm the health of the general population, or to any potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulation. If the EPA determines that, due to those potential cumulative impacts, there does not exist a reasonable certainty of no harm to the health to such populations, then the EPA must deny the permit application.</p>

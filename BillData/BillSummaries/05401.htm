 <p><b>Nuclear Waste Task Force Act of 2021</b></p> <p>This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency to establish a task force that must evaluate the implications of amending the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to remove exemptions from environmental laws for spent nuclear waste and high-level radioactive waste in order to enable consent-based siting of disposal and storage solutions for such waste. The task force must provide a clear explanation of what constitutes <i>consent-based siting</i>. In addition, the task force may provide participation grants to help environmental justice communities on issues relating to the storage and disposal of such waste.</p>

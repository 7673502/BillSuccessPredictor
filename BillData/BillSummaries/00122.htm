 <p><strong>Original Living Wage Act </strong></p> <p> This bill increases the federal minimum wage to the minimum hourly wage sufficient for a person working for 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, to earn an annual income 25.5% higher than the federal poverty threshold for a four-person household, with two children under age 18, and living in the 48 contiguous states. (Under current poverty thresholds, the national minimum wage would be set at approximately $15.64 per hour.)</p> <p> The Department of Labor must determine the minimum wage rate by June 1, 2021, and review it every four years.

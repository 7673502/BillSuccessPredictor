 <p><b>Clearing Lines along Electrical At-Risk Zones Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises requirements related to vegetation management practices and forest management activities. </p> <p>The bill redefines <i>hazard trees</i> as trees that come within 50 feet (rather than 10 feet, as under current law) of an electric power line. Hazard trees are subject to certain management activities under current law.</p> <p>A vegetation management, facility inspection, and operation and maintenance plan shall describe processes for consultation with private landowners with respect to hazard trees identified for removal.</p> <p>Such plans must be approved according to specified deadlines.</p> <p>The bill generally excludes specified forest management activities from certain environmental assessment and environmental impact statement requirements.

The use of this exclusion shall not be subject to extraordinary circumstances procedures.</p>

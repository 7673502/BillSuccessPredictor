 <p><b>Scholarship for Service: The Building Better Americans Act</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a scholarship-for-service program for students who served at least two years in the military, an emergency medical service, or a police force, or as a teacher's assistant or firefighter, and who submit a certification of such service prior to enrolling as an undergraduate in an institution of higher education (IHE). An eligible undergraduate student may receive a grant in the amount equal to the cost of attendance at the IHE in which the student enrolls for two academic years.</p>

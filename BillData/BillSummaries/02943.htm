 <p>This bill allows sole proprietors a retroactive elective deferral under a tax-exempt retirement plan that is adopted after the close of the taxable year and before the time for the filing of the individual's tax return. The elective deferral is treated as made prior to the end of the plan's first plan year.</p> <p>An <em>elective deferral </em>is an amount contributed to certain tax-exempt retirement plans (e.g., 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SIMPLE pension plans and IRAs) by an employer at the employee's election and which, except to the extent they are designated Roth IRA contributions, are excludable from the employee's gross income.</p>

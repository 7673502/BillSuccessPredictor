                                 A BILL


 
To allow Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Program assistance 
    be used to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reducing Racial and Ethnic 
Disparities in the Juvenile Justice System Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and other youth of color 
        are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system and receive 
        harsher consequences than White youth.
            (2) Reducing reliance on incarceration and providing 
        evidence-based, trauma-informed, and linguistically and 
        culturally responsive support and services to youth who come in 
        contact with the juvenile justice system is a key goal of the 
        Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (34 
        U.S.C. 11101 et seq.).
            (3) Addressing racial and ethnic disparities in the 
        juvenile justice system requires accurate data regarding youth 
        of color who come into contact with the juvenile justice 
        system, including data that can be disaggregated by race, and 
        ethnicity.
            (4) Youth of color and their families with lived experience 
        interacting with the juvenile justice system can provide 
        important insight, analysis, and solutions regarding how to 
        recognize and address racial disparities in the juvenile 
        justice system.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITY.

    (a) In General.--Section 103 of the Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (34 U.S.C. 11103) is amended by 
striking paragraph (41) and inserting the following:
            ``(41) the term `racial and ethnic disparity' means--
                    ``(A) that Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and other 
                youth of color are involved at a decision point in the 
                juvenile justice system at disproportionately higher 
                rates than White youth at that decision point;
                    ``(B) that the percentage of Black, Indigenous, 
                Hispanic, and other youth of color at any decision 
                point is higher than the percentage of youth of color 
                in the general population;
                    ``(C) that Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and other 
                youth of color experience more severe outcomes at any 
                decision point than similarly situated White youth; or
                    ``(D) that Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and other 
                youth of color are detained and removed from their 
                homes when less restrictive alternatives would be more 
                effective;''.
    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--Section 251(a)(1)(B)(viii) 
of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (34 
U.S.C. 11161(a)(1)(B)(viii)) is amended by striking ``members of 
minority groups'' and inserting ``Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, and 
other youth of color''.

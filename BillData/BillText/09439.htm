SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to acknowledge the chronic failure of the Federal 
        Government--
                    (A) to fulfill its trust responsibilities to 
                American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Indian tribes; 
                and
                    (B) to respect its special political and legal 
                relationship with Native Hawaiians;
            (2) to acknowledge the treaty obligations of the Federal 
        Government to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Indian 
        tribes, which have never been fulfilled;
            (3) to ensure progress toward the fulfillment of trust and 
        treaty obligations of the Federal Government;
            (4) to ensure progress toward adequate funding for programs 
        for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and 
        Indian tribes;
            (5) to reaffirm and uphold Tribal sovereignty and self-
        governance; and
            (6) to acknowledge the broken promises of the Federal 
        Government to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiians, as embodied 
        by--
                    (A) the failure to uphold treaty obligations;
                    (B) the failure to fund programs that should have 
                been fully funded in exchange for the loss of life and 
                indigenous homelands;
                    (C) the ceded land and stolen natural resources 
                from Tribal lands; and
                    (D) the acts taken to extinguish Native American 
                culture and the traditions of American Indians, Alaska 
                Natives, and Native Hawaiians.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) in December 2018, the United States Commission on Civil 
        Rights issued a report entitled ``Broken Promises: Continuing 
        Federal Funding Shortfall for Native Americans'', which made a 
        number of important findings, which are related to the findings 
        described in paragraphs (2) through (8);
            (2) the unique government-to-government relationship 
        between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, and the trust 
        responsibility and obligations of the Federal Government to 
        American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Indian tribes, are--
                    (A) enumerated in the United States Constitution, 
                Acts of Congress, Executive orders, Supreme Court 
                precedent, and Federal policies and regulations; and
                    (B) as applicable, established in Indian treaties 
                signed by the United States;
            (3) Congress has also passed more than 150 laws that 
        promote the welfare of Native Hawaiians and affirm a special 
        political and legal relationship with Native Hawaiians arising 
        out of their status as Indigenous, Native people;
            (4) Federal programs designed to support the social and 
        economic well-being of American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native 
        Hawaiians, and Indian tribes remain chronically underfunded and 
        sometimes inefficiently structured, which--
                    (A) leaves many basic obligations of the Federal 
                Government in rural and urban areas with large 
                populations of Native Americans unmet; and
                    (B) contributes to the inequities observed in 
                Native American communities;
            (5) woefully inadequate Federal funding for Native American 
        programs often comes with restrictions that hamper access to 
        funds, including indirect allocations of Federal funding to 
        State governments to be provided to Tribal governments and 
        Native American communities at the State's discretion, which 
        further diminishes the direct government-to-government 
        relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes 
        and other funding mechanisms for Native American communities;
            (6) Congress often provides funding for Native American 
        programs in a manner that makes efficient long-term planning 
        and budgeting impossible or exceedingly difficult for Tribal 
        governments, tribal organizations, urban Indian organizations, 
        and Native American communities;
            (7) the Federal Government continues to fail to keep 
        accurate, consistent, and comprehensive records of Federal 
        spending for Native American programs, either for a given 
        fiscal year or for longer time periods, making monitoring of 
        Federal spending to meet the trust responsibility and 
        obligations of the Federal Government difficult; and
            (8)(A) the Federal Government continues to insufficiently 
        track Native American populations and use outdated or 
        incomplete data points, contributing to the lack of adequate 
        funding provided for necessary resources;
            (B) there is a critical need for more accurate and current 
        data collection for American Indians, Alaska Natives, and 
        Native Hawaiians, including disaggregated data on those 
        populations; and
            (C) inaccurate and undercounted data can negatively impact 
        Federal funds and services received by American Indian, Alaska 
        Native, and Native Hawaiian communities.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Indian tribes are distinct sovereigns that have a 
        government-to-government relationship with the Federal 
        Government;
            (2)(A) the Federal Government has trust and treaty 
        obligations to Indian tribes that are established in treaties 
        signed by the United States and enumerated in the Constitution 
        of the United States, Acts of Congress, Executive orders, 
        Supreme Court precedent, and Federal policies and regulations; 
        and
            (B) those treaties, like all treaties made under the 
        authority of the United States, are the supreme law of the 
        land, as recognized in article VI of the Constitution of the 
        United States;
            (3)(A) the Federal Government has historically failed to 
        carry out its promises and trust and treaty obligations to 
        American Indians, Alaska Natives, Indian tribes, and, as 
        applicable, Native Hawaiians; and
            (B) those failures--
                    (i) are ongoing, as the Federal Government 
                continually fails to adequately support the social and 
                economic well-being of American Indians, Alaska 
                Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Indian tribes; and
                    (ii) have created a civil rights crisis;
            (4) the historical failures of the Federal Government 
        described in paragraph (3) include--
                    (A) federally mandated depopulation of Native 
                Americans, including--
                            (i) numerous massacres carried out by the 
                        United States; and
                            (ii) the forced relocation efforts and 
                        genocide practices carried out by the United 
                        States;
                    (B) successive oppressive government policies, such 
                as the allotment and assimilation, termination, and 
                relocation eras;
                    (C) suppression, assimilation, and cultural 
                annihilation practices carried out against the United 
                States Indigenous peoples; and
                    (D) an ongoing failure to acknowledge that the 
                lands that make up the United States are indigenous 
                lands;
            (5) the Federal Government must do far more to live up to 
        its trust and treaty obligations to American Indians and Alaska 
        Natives and Indian tribes, for just as the United States 
        expects all nations to live up to their own treaty obligations, 
        the United States should live up to its own promises;
            (6) the Federal Government can empower American Indians, 
        Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians to realize enormous 
        potential by honoring its promises and obligations through the 
        enactment of legislation; and
            (7) American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians 
        have long demonstrated remarkable strength, resilience, and 
        revitalization despite the broken promises of the Federal 
        Government and failure to acknowledge their contributions to 
        the United States.

              INTERIOR.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Department of the 
Interior (referred to in this section as the ``Department'') the 
position of Deputy Secretary for Native Nations, who shall--
            (1) report immediately to the Secretary of the Interior; 
        and
            (2) be equal with the Deputy Secretary of the Interior.
    (b) Duties.--The Secretary of the Interior shall delegate to the 
Deputy Secretary for Native Nations responsibility for--

        under the jurisdiction of the Department;
            (2) coordinating with Cabinet-level officials to ensure the 
        effective provision of Federal support for Tribal self-
        government and programs for American Indians, Alaska Natives, 
        Native Hawaiians, and Indian tribes and services under the 
        Department; and
            (3) implementing Indian treaties, statutes, regulations, 
        Executive and Secretarial orders, programs, policies, and other

SEC. 12. TRIBAL CONSULTATION BY FEDERAL AGENCIES.

    (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to enumerate a non-exhaustive set of principles to 
        inform a codification of how Federal agencies should engage in 
        meaningful and timely Tribal consultation;
            (2) to underscore the importance of Tribal consultation in 
        the fulfilment of the trust and treaty obligations of the 
        Federal Government;
            (3) to affirm Tribal consultation and the principle of 
        free, prior, and informed consent as rights of Indian tribes, 
        predicated on Tribal sovereignty and self-determination; and
            (4) to affirm the need for the entire Federal Government to 
        recognize the importance of ``regular and meaningful 
        consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the 
        development of Federal policies that have tribal implications, 
        to strengthen the United States government-to-government 
        relationships with Indian tribes, and to reduce the imposition 
        of unfunded mandates upon Indian tribes,'' as quoted in 
        Executive Order 13175 and elaborated in the Presidential 
        Memorandum of January 26, 2021.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) as of January 2021, there existed more than 27 
        directives, handbooks, plans, policies, orders, and similar 
        documents implementing various Tribal consultation policies, 
        totaling more than 300 pages;
            (2) the current lack of centralization in Federal agencies' 
        Tribal consultation policies results in a large number of 
        policies with which Indian tribes are expected to be familiar 
        in order to engage in consultation;
            (3) the current lack of centralization in Federal agencies' 
        Tribal consultations--
                    (A) results in a number of challenges, including 
                scheduling conflicts and unsustainable drains on the 
                resources of Indian tribes and the time of Tribal 
                leaders; and
                    (B) reflect a lack of respect for Tribal leaders;
            (4) Federal agency consultation policies take dramatically 
        different views on the purpose of Tribal consultation, 
        resulting in significantly different experiences for Indian 
        tribes attempting to engage in meaningful nation-to-nation 
        dialogue; and
            (5) history demonstrates that the Federal Government best 
        serves Native American communities when Tribal governments are 
        empowered to lead their own communities.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) consultation is a right between sovereigns, and the 
        responsibilities and privileges associated with it cannot be 
        delegated to other actors;
            (2) the purpose of Tribal consultation should be for the 
        Federal Government to obtain the free, prior, and informed 
        consent of affected Indian tribes;
            (3) Tribal consultation--
                    (A) is both a right of Indian tribes and a process;
                    (B) should occur when any Federal rulemaking, 
                legislation, policy, guidance, operational activity, 
                grant or funding formula change, or other action may 
                have a substantial direct effect on Indian tribes;
                    (C) requires dialogue, which should often take 
                place through formal face-to-face meetings, but may 
                also occur through telephonic, electronic, or printed 
                means;
                    (D) should be used to empower Tribal governments to 
                lead their own communities;
                    (E)(i) should be a collaborative process;
                    (ii) should be built upon the exchange of 
                information; and
                    (iii) should promote enhanced communication that 
                emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility;
                    (F) should involve individuals with decision-making 
                authority; and
                    (G) in its current form is inadequate and requires 
                far more from the Federal Government;
            (4) the records resulting from consultations between the 
        Federal Government and Tribal governments should be maintained 
        and published, subject to the condition that sensitive Tribal 
        information should be protected;
            (5) for Tribal consultation to be effective, both Indian 
        tribes and the Federal Government should have the capacity to 
        engage effectively in the consultation process;
            (6) any legislation or policy attempting to prescribe the 
        conditions of Tribal consultation should be preceded by the 
        gathering of Tribal input with the goal of reaching a consensus 
        on the proposed legislation; and
            (7) Indian tribes--
                    (A) should be involved in the Tribal consultation 
                process on their request or as early as practicable;
                    (B) should have a meaningful remedy for violations 
                of their right to Tribal consultation;
                    (C) should be entitled to a codified, formal 
                dispute resolution process to provide the Indian tribes 
                with a potential remedy when their rights as sovereigns 
                are violated by the Federal Government; and
                    (D) should receive adequate notice, and sufficient 
                information, about any Tribal consultation sessions.

              TITLE I--CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Tribal law enforcement agencies in American Indian and 
        Alaska Native communities have fewer officers per capita than 
        other law enforcement agencies nationwide, leaving residents of 
        Indian country and Alaska Native Villages less safe and subject 
        to higher rates of crime;
            (2) Native Americans are killed during police encounters at 
        a higher rate than any other group;
            (3) Native Americans suffer as victims of violent crime at 
        a rate that is 2.5 times the national average;
            (4) Native American women are 10 times more likely to be 
        murdered and 2 times more likely to experience rape or 
        experience sexual assault crimes;
            (5) the criminal justice system in its current form creates 
        structural barriers and fails to recognize Tribal sovereignty 
        and inherent Tribal criminal jurisdiction on Tribal lands;
            (6) some Indian tribes established Tribal courts before 
        some State courts;
            (7) for example, the Cherokee Nation opened its Supreme 
        Court in 1822, 23 years before the State of Georgia opened its 
        own Supreme Court;
            (8) Indian tribes historically exercised criminal 
        jurisdiction over non-Indians who committed crimes on Tribal 
        lands;
            (9) for example, in 1825, the Muscogee (Creek) Nation 
        passed a law criminalizing rape against women on Creek lands, 
        which applied to all ``persons'', regardless of Tribal 
        citizenship status, and the Muscogee (Creek) Nation prosecuted 
        non-Indian and Indian men who raped women on Creek lands;
            (10) the history of inadequate Federal funding for public 
        safety on Tribal lands and complex legal jurisdiction on Tribal 
        lands negatively impacts access to counsel in Tribal courts;
            (11) in Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191, 
        212 (1978), the Supreme Court concluded that whether Indian 
        tribes should ``be authorized to try non-Indians'' is a 
        consideration ``for Congress to weigh'';
            (12) the Supreme Court recently affirmed this holding in 
        June 2021, in United States v. Cooley, 141 S. Ct. 1638, 1643 
        (2021), concluding once again that ``tribal authority remains 
        subject to the plenary authority of Congress'';
            (13) existing successful Federal and Tribal self-governance 
        programs working to combat the inequities described in this 
        section face chronic underfunding; and
            (14) the special Tribal criminal jurisdiction exercised by 
        Indian tribes pursuant to section 204 of Public Law 90-284 (25 
        U.S.C. 1304) (commonly known as the ``Indian Civil Rights Act 
        of 1968'') has been a success.

SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress should provide more resources for public 
        safety and other programs of the Department of Justice and the 
        Bureau of Indian Affairs that make American Indian and Alaska 
        Native communities safer;
            (2) Congress should provide more resources for Tribal law 
        enforcement agencies, Tribal courts, and Tribal detention 
        centers to ensure Tribal sovereignty over public safety 
        programs in Indian country and Alaska Native Villages;
            (3) Indian tribes have the inherent sovereign authority to 
        exercise full criminal jurisdiction over persons--
                    (A) within the sovereign territory of the Indian 
                tribe; and
                    (B) who commit a violation of Tribal criminal law;
            (4) the Supreme Court of the United States, in Oliphant v. 
        Suquamish Indian Tribe, 435 U.S. 191 (1978), violated the 
        inherent sovereign authority of Indian tribes by wrongly 
        limiting tribal criminal jurisdiction and removing Tribal 
        authority to prosecute non-Indians unless authorized by 
        Congress;
            (5) the limitation by the Supreme Court of the United 
        States of inherent Tribal jurisdiction has effectively granted 
        non-Indians immunity for crimes committed in Indian country and 
        Alaska Native Villages, leading to violence and criminal 
        activity by non-Indians and preventing Indian tribes from 
        taking recourse;
            (6) the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 
        (Public Law 113-4; 127 Stat. 54) recognized and affirmed the 
        inherent criminal jurisdiction of Indian tribes over non-
        Indians who commit crimes of domestic violence against Indians 
        in Indian country;
            (7) the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2022 
        (Public Law 117-103; 136 Stat. 840) recognized and affirmed the 
        inherent criminal jurisdiction of Indian tribes over non-
        Indians who commit crimes of assaults on Tribal justice 
        personnel, child violence, obstruction of justice, sexual 
        violence, sex trafficking, and stalking;
            (8) the jurisdiction of Indian tribes over the crimes 
        described in paragraphs (6) and (7) is known as ``special 
        Tribal criminal jurisdiction'';
            (9) the exercise of special Tribal criminal jurisdiction 
        has allowed many Indian tribes to begin to address the crisis 
        of violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women by 
        holding offenders accountable and pursuing justice for victims;
            (10) the Indian tribes that have chosen to implement 
        special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction under the 
        Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 
        113-4; 127 Stat. 54) have successfully upheld the rights of 
        defendants under that Act and complied with the requirements of 
        that Act, including due process protections, but this partial 
        restoration of Tribal jurisdiction has proven insufficient to 
        address the range of serious crimes committed by non-Indians in 
        Indian country and Alaska Native Villages and in violation of 
        Tribal criminal law, and as a result, a large number of violent 
        crimes committed against Native victims go unprosecuted; and
            (11) Congress has a trust duty and responsibility, stemming 
        from both the treaties signed with Indian tribes and the 
        Constitution of the United States, to fund and support strong 
        Tribal governments, which necessarily includes the funding of 
        Tribal courts, Tribal law enforcement, and victim services.

            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, in addition to all powers of self-government recognized 
        and affirmed by sections 201 and 203, the powers of self-
        government of a participating tribe include the inherent power

                extraterritorial jurisdiction of the participating 
                tribe.
            ``(2) Applicability.--Nothing in this section--
                    ``(A) creates or eliminates any Federal or State

                Native Village; or
                    ``(B) affects the authority of the United States or

                         TITLE II--HEALTH CARE

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) funding for the Indian Health Service and health care 
        for American Indians and Alaska Natives is inequitable and 
        unequal;
            (2) Indian Health Service expenditures per capita are well 
        below other Federal healthcare programs, which results in--
                    (A) unacceptable health conditions of American 
                Indians and Alaska Natives; and
                    (B) American Indians and Alaska Natives living 
                sicker and dying younger than other individuals in the 
                United States;
            (3) the urban Indian health care budget has failed to keep 
        pace with urban Indian population growth or inflation, and that 
        severe underfunding impedes fulfillment of the trust and treaty 
        obligations of the Federal Government;
            (4) due to chronic underfunding to healthcare programs that 
        serve American Indians and Alaska Natives, American Indians and 
        Alaska Natives face overwhelming health disparities compared to 
        other populations, including--
                    (A) having lower life expectancies and experiencing 
                a disproportionate number of diseases; and
                    (B) dying at higher rates than other individuals in 
                the United States from chronic liver disease, 
                cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, unintentional injuries, 
                intentional self-harm and suicide, and chronic lower 
                respiratory diseases;
            (5) the significant decline of third-party reimbursements 
        for care, as clinics serving Tribal areas operate with limited 
        staff and cancel non-essential procedures and visits, is 
        affecting Tribal resources, which--
                    (A) reduces the amount that Tribal health 
                facilities can bill Medicare, Medicaid, or other 
                private insurances for reimbursement of services; and
                    (B) poses a threat to the continuity of operations 
                of those facilities;
            (6)(A) section 10221 of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 935) 
        permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act 
        (25 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) in the hope of reducing health 
        disparities faced by Native Americans; but
            (B) many of the provisions of the Indian Health Care 
        Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) remain underfunded; 
        and
            (7) the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act (42 
        U.S.C. 11701 et seq.) authorized the Native Hawaiian Health 
        Care Program--
                    (A) to improve the health status of Native 
                Hawaiians; and
                    (B) to provide Native Hawaiian health care programs 
                with the resources necessary to improve the health 
                status of Native Hawaiians.

SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) funding for the delivery of health care to American 
        Indians, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians through the 
        Indian Health Service, Indian tribes, tribal organizations, 
        urban Indian organizations, and the Native Hawaiian Health Care 
        Program should be fully funded;
            (2) the funding described in paragraph (1) should be 
        mandatory;
            (3) Congress should allocate funding to job training and 
        tuition reimbursement programs to increase the number of 
        clinicians and non-medical health care staff serving American 
        Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Indian tribes;
            (4) Congress should provide funding under the Medicare 
        program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1395 et seq.) and the Medicaid program under title XIX of that 
        Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) directly to Indian tribes and end 
        the practice of pass-through of funds through States;
            (5)(A) the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 
        1601 et seq.) is crucial to protecting the health and well-
        being of American Indians and Alaska Natives;
            (B) all of the provisions of that Act should be implemented 
        and fully funded; and
            (C) in accordance with section 3 of that Act (25 U.S.C. 
        1602), it is the policy of the United States, in fulfillment of 
        the special trust responsibilities and legal obligations to 
        Indians of the United States, including Indians living in urban 
        settings--
                    (i) to ensure the highest possible health status 
                for Indians and to provide all resources necessary to 
                effect that policy;
                    (ii) to raise the health status of Indians to at 
                least the levels set forth in the goals contained 
                within the Healthy People 2010 initiative or successor 
                objectives;
                    (iii) to ensure maximum Indian participation in the 
                direction of health care services so as to render the 
                persons administering such services and the services 
                themselves more responsive to the needs and desires of 
                Indian communities;
                    (iv) to increase the proportion of all degrees in 
                the health professions and allied and associated health 
                professions awarded to Indians so that the proportion 
                of Indian health professionals in each Indian Health 
                Service area is raised to at least the level of that of 
                the general population;
                    (v) to require that all actions under that Act 
                shall be carried out with active and meaningful 
                consultation with Indian tribes, and conference with 
                tribal organizations and urban Indian organizations, to 
                implement that Act and the national policy of Indian 
                self-determination;
                    (vi) to ensure that the United States and Indian 
                tribes work in a government-to-government relationship 
                to ensure quality health care for all Tribal members; 
                and
                    (vii) to provide funding for programs and 
                facilities operated by Indian tribes and tribal 
                organizations in amounts that are not less than the 
                amounts provided to programs and facilities operated 
                directly by the Indian Health Service;
            (6) legal challenges to that Act and the Patient Protection 
        and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 111-148; 124 Stat. 119) are 
        harmful;
            (7) legislation to address the opioid and substance use 
        epidemic facing American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native 
        Hawaiian communities (known as the ``Comprehensive Addiction 
        Resources Emergency Act of 2021'', S. 3418 and H.R. 6311, 117th 
        Congress, as introduced on December 16, 2021) should be enacted 
        without delay; and
            (8) legislation to provide significant resources to Indian 
        tribes to combat child abuse and neglect (known as the 
        ``American Indian and Alaska Native Child Abuse Prevention and 
        Treatment Act'', S. 1868 and H.R. 1566, 117th Congress, as 
        introduced on May 26, 2021, and March 3, 2021, respectively) 
        should be enacted without delay.

                          TITLE III--EDUCATION

SEC. 301. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1)(A) Native American students experience discernible 
        disparities in access to educational opportunities compared to 
        their non-Native-American peers; and
            (B) those disparities in educational opportunities--
                    (i) have a profound impact on the social and 
                economic opportunities and well-being of Native 
                American students and Native American communities; and
                    (ii) mean that Native American students are likely 
                to experience disproportionate levels of discipline 
                while in school that leads to those students being 
                suspended or expelled, increasing the likelihood of 
                those students to be involved in the school-to-prison 
                pipeline;
            (2) the Federal Government has failed in its trust 
        obligation to provide educational services that address the 
        unique situation of Native American students;
            (3)(A) a majority of Native American students attend public 
        schools, many of which lack curricula that provide historically 
        accurate and culturally competent representation or discussion 
        of Native Americans and their history in the United States; and
            (B) the failure to include historically accurate and 
        culturally competent curricula leads to a lack of understanding 
        for all students of the history and contributions of Native 
        Americans;
            (4)(A) Native American students make up 1.1 percent of 
        students attending public schools;
            (B) Native American students have the lowest high school 
        graduation rates and the lowest scores on reading and math 
        elementary and secondary school standardized tests;
            (C) students attending schools funded by the Bureau of 
        Indian Affairs (referred to in this title as ``Bureau-funded 
        schools'') have lower academic scores than their non-Native 
        American peers who attend public school; and
            (D) educational disparities continue into higher education, 
        with only 16 percent of Native American students obtaining a 
        bachelor's degree compared to the national average of 36 
        percent of individuals in the same age group;
            (5)(A) the enactment of the Indian Self-Determination and 
        Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) allowed 
        federally recognized Indian tribes to contract with the Bureau-
        funded schools and provide education programs;
            (B) with 183 Bureau-funded schools, the Bureau of Indian 
        Education is obligated to provide culturally relevant, high-
        quality education opportunities to Native American students; 
        and
            (C) Bureau-funded schools consistently struggle to recruit 
        and retain qualified and effective teachers due to 
        noncompetitive salaries, isolated rural settings, difficult 
        work environments, lack of job opportunities for spouses and 
        partners, and marginal housing opportunities; and
            (6)(A) American Indian and Alaska Native tribally chartered 
        colleges and universities (TCUs) were established beginning in 
        the late 1960s due to the failure of the United States higher 
        education system to include American Indians;
            (B) in addition to providing place-based and culturally 
        grounded higher and career/technical education, TCUs are 
        charged with preserving and revitalizing Tribal cultures, 
        languages and lands, and strengthening Tribal sovereignty; and
            (C) TCUs face significant challenges and inequities, 
        including--
                    (i) the lack of adequate operating funding from the 
                Department of the Interior;
                    (ii) the inability to grow endowments; and
                    (iii) a disproportionate number of students living 
                in poverty, suffering food and housing insecurity, and 
                unprepared for post-secondary education.

SEC. 302. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that Congress should--
            (1) provide full funding for Tribal Colleges and 
        Universities and Bureau-funded schools, including increased 
        funding to develop lessons and curricula that provide 
        culturally competent and historically accurate information;
            (2) provide increased funding to recruit and retain 
        teachers at schools that serve a high proportion of Native 
        students, including Bureau-funded schools, in order to address 
        the educational disparities faced by Native American students 
        described in section 301;
            (3) provide full funding for school construction and 
        repairs at Bureau-funded schools, which have lacked 
        longstanding adequate funding and prioritization, to correct 
        facilities operations inefficiencies that contribute to the 
        chronic poor educational outcomes and performance of students 
        at those schools; and
            (4) increase and make permanent programmatic funding for 
        Native American language programs to restore the elimination of 
        traditional languages that colonial education forced on Native 
        American students during the Assimilation Era.

                           TITLE IV--HOUSING

SEC. 401. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) there is a housing crisis in Indian country that has 
        worsened over the 20-year period preceding the date of 
        introduction of this Act;
            (2) the trust obligations of the Federal Government include 
        providing housing opportunities for Native Americans;
            (3) funding for the block grant programs under titles I and 
        VIII of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-
        Determination Act of 1996 (25 U.S.C. 4111 et seq., 25 U.S.C. 
        4221 et seq.)--
                    (A) has not matched inflation; and
                    (B) fails to cover the growing construction costs 
                and demand for housing in Indian country;
            (4) due in part to a lack of affordable housing, many 
        Native Americans live in overcrowded conditions, resulting in--
                    (A) the average household size for Native Americans 
                exceeding that of the overall average household size in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) overcrowding rates in Tribal areas exceeding 
                that of the overall overcrowding rate in other areas in 
                the United States;
            (5) lack of access to water is a substantially larger 
        problem in Indian country than in the United States as a whole; 
        and
            (6) the historical displacement by the Federal Government 
        of Native American communities to remote locations and the 
        ongoing failure of the Federal Government to support the 
        development of adequate infrastructure, including access to 
        water, roads, and other basic utilities, continues to 
        exacerbate housing inequities in Indian country.

SEC. 402. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Federal Government should provide steady, 
        equitable, noncompetitive, and nondiscretionary funding 
        directly to Indian tribes, Tribal governments, tribal 
        organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations to support the 
        development of housing;
            (2) legislation to address the housing needs in Native 
        American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities (known 
        as the ``American Housing and Economic Mobility Act of 2021'', 
        S. 1368 and H.R. 2768, 117th Congress, as introduced in April 
        2021 and previously supported in a resolution adopted by the 
        National American Indian Housing Council) should be enacted 
        without delay; and
            (3) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development should 
        continue to consult with Indian tribes, confer with tribal 
        organizations, and collaborate with Native Hawaiian 
        organizations to ensure that Indian tribes, tribal 
        organizations, and Native Hawaiian organizations are maximizing 
        their capacity and technical expertise to provide for increased 
        housing and infrastructure in their communities.

SEC. 403. INDIAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM.

    Section 108 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-

                     TITLE V--ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

SEC. 501. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal Government has failed to honor its trust 
        responsibility to promote Tribal self-determination through the 
        support of economic development on Tribal lands;
            (2) the Federal Government has failed to assist Indian 
        tribes with the individualized economic development necessary 
        for Indian tribes--
                    (A) to exercise self-determination; and
                    (B) to make knowledgeable decisions as to how to 
                best develop and manage the resources on Tribal lands 
                for the benefit of the Indian tribe;
            (3) Native Americans experience--
                    (A) a poverty rate that is approximately twice the 
                national average; and
                    (B) higher rates of unemployment than any other 
                group of people in the United States;
            (4) due to the remote location of many Indian tribes, 
        individuals may have long commutes, which are further 
        exacerbated by inadequate roads and infrastructure due to 
        chronic underfunding and lack of transportation;
            (5) Indian tribes have had limited access to, or, in many 
        cases, no direct access to, electricity, water, broadband, and 
        adequate infrastructure;
            (6)(A) only 65 percent of American Indians and Alaska 
        Natives living on Tribal lands have access to fixed broadband 
        services;
            (B) only 69 percent of American Indian, Alaska Native, and 
        Native Hawaiian households residing on rural Tribal lands have 
        telephone services; and
            (C) the lack of access described in subparagraphs (A) and 
        (B) is in stark contrast with the national average of 98 
        percent of households that have access to telephone services, 
        and 92 percent of individuals living outside of Tribal lands 
        that have access to fixed broadband services;
            (7) approximately 1,500,000 people living on Tribal lands 
        lack access to broadband;
            (8) 75 percent of rural Indian Health Service facilities 
        still lack reliable broadband networks for American Indians and 
        Alaska Natives to access telehealth or clinical health care 
        services, which is a critical need in the most geographically 
        isolated areas of the United States, furthering economic 
        inequities on Tribal lands;
            (9) according to the Bureau of Indian Education, up to 95 
        percent of Native American students at some Bureau of Indian 
        Education schools cannot access internet services at home;
            (10) lack of internet access negatively affects the ability 
        to conduct business online, which took on increased importance 
        since the beginning of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
        pandemic; and
            (11) very few Indian tribes have established 
        telecommunications companies to provide residential phone and 
        internet services.

SEC. 502. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress should determine and provide the funding 
        needed to meet the essential utilities and core infrastructure 
        needs on Tribal lands, such as electricity, water, 
        telecommunications, and roads;
            (2) Congress should--
                    (A) provide direct, mandatory funding to Indian 
                tribes and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands; and
                    (B) allow Indian tribes and the Department of 
                Hawaiian Home Lands to leverage Federal funding;
            (3) in cases in which Federal infrastructure projects occur 
        on or affect Tribal lands or Tribal or Native Hawaiian 
        communities, the Federal Government should engage in, as 
        applicable--
                    (A) consistent, transparent, and deferential 
                consultation with Indian tribes; and
                    (B) consistent, transparent, and deferential 
                collaboration with the Department of Hawaiian Home 
                Lands and Native Hawaiian organizations;
            (4) the Federal Government should include Tribal 
        sovereignty principles for Indian tribes to manage and self-
        govern natural resources, including electromagnetic spectrum 
        over Tribal lands, in accordance with the Federal trust 
        responsibility and acknowledgment of their sovereignty, to 
        promote economic development and self-management of those 
        modern natural resources;
            (5) the Federal Government should clarify the inherent 
        ownership by Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations of 
        spectrum licenses and spectrum over Tribal lands and Hawaiians, 
        and preserve that ownership, in furtherance of the Federal 
        trust responsibility over, and Indian and Native Hawaiian self-
        governance of their own modern natural resources;
            (6) the Federal Government should--
                    (A) diminish the effect of the Tribal priority 
                filing windows, auctions for spectrum licenses over 
                Tribal lands, and assignment and leasing of spectrum 
                over Tribal lands carried out by the Federal 
                Communications Commission;
                    (B) ensure the competitive bidding authority of the 
                Federal Communications Commission does not apply to 
                licenses or construction permits issued by the 
                Commission over Tribal lands and Hawaiian home lands; 
                and
                    (C) permanently eliminate the public availability 
                of spectrum over Tribal lands and Hawaiian home lands; 
                and
            (7) legislation to address the lack of spectrum access by 
        Indian tribes over Tribal lands and to deploy wireless 
        broadband services, in furtherance of Tribal sovereignty (known 
        as the ``DIGITAL Reservations Act'' or the ``Deploying the 
        Internet by Guaranteeing Indian Tribes Autonomy over Licensing 
        on Reservations Act'', S. 4331 and H.R. 7774, 116th Congress, 
        as introduced on July 27, 2020, and July 24, 2020, 
        respectively), should be enacted without delay.

        shall be adjusted so that the amount of Federal universal 
        service support provided through the Tribal Broadband Fund for 
        such subsequent fiscal year bears the same proportion to the 
        amount of Federal universal service support provided through 
        all Federal universal service support mechanisms other than the 
        Tribal Broadband Fund for such subsequent fiscal year as the 
        proportion that $1,000,000,000 bears to the amount of Federal 
        universal service support provided through all Federal 
        universal service support mechanisms other than the Tribal 
        Broadband Fund for fiscal year 2023.
    (c) Provision of Support.--The Commission shall use the Tribal

entities to provide--
            (1) technical assistance, deployment of broadband 
        infrastructure, maintenance, planning, training, and digital 
        literacy programs to increase broadband services and network 
        buildout on Tribal lands, in addition to further economic 
        development initiatives for all spectrum on Tribal lands, 
        including radio, television, broadcast, commercial, and 
        noncommercial uses, and current generation or better broadband 
        services;
            (2) infrastructure for middle mile and long-haul fiber 
        buildout, adoption of digital literacy, and other related

        access to, telecommunications, broadband, spectrum use and 
        future development, and wireless services (including broadband 
        service); and
            (3) other smart infrastructure development and integration 
        on Tribal lands, and other related activities to ensure Tribal 
        lands have full access to high-speed broadband services, 
        telecommunications services, and other sovereignty of 
        communications infrastructure covering Tribal lands.
    (d) Prioritization.--In allocating funds from the Tribal Broadband 
Fund, the Commission--
            (1) shall prioritize locations where telecommunications or 
        broadband services have left residents underserved; and
            (2) may use funds in locations described in paragraph (1) 
        for last mile fiber, middle mile fiber, backhaul transit, 
        interconnection, and other costs and repairs to damaged

Universities for the purpose of immediate deployment of 
telecommunications or broadband services or infrastructure development 
over Tribal lands.
    (f) Final Order.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall release a final order 
adopting rules and policies associated with the establishment, 
implementation, and administration of the Tribal Broadband Fund.

        receive priority where telecommunications or broadband services 
        on Tribal lands--
                    (A) have not been deployed; or
                    (B) have been inadequately deployed to provide

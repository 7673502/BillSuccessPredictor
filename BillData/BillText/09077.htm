     To amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for certain 
 requirements relating to the retirement, adoption, and recognition of 
             military working dogs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Canine Members of the Armed Forces 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Each of the Armed Forces and other Government agencies, 
        including the Secret Service, the Central Intelligence Agency, 
        and the Transportation Security Administration, use military 
        working dogs in service to the country.
            (2) Since September 11, 2011, military working dogs have 
        served in Iraq and Afghanistan and have been trained in 
        explosive detection, narcotic detection, sentry, patrol, 
        tracking, and other specific duties.
            (3) Military working dogs, through their training, have 
        prevented injuries and saved the lives of thousands of United 
        States citizens.
            (4) Military working dogs perform critical and varied roles 
        that go far beyond their current designation as ``equipment''.

SEC. 3. RETIREMENT AND ADOPTION OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS.

    (a) Retirement and Reclassification of Military Working Dogs.--
Section 2583 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (f), (g), (h), and (i) as

            (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new 
        subsections:
    ``(f) Classification of Military Working Dogs.--The Secretary of 
Defense shall classify military working dogs as canine members of the 
Armed Forces. Such dogs shall not be classified as equipment.
    ``(g) Transfer of Retired Military Working Dogs.--If the Secretary 
of the military department concerned determines that a military working 
dog should be retired, and no suitable adoption is available at the 
military facility where the dog is located, the Secretary may transfer 
the dog--
            ``(1) to the 341st Training Squadron; or
            ``(2) to another location for adoption under this 
        section.''.
    (b) Acceptance of Frequent Traveler Miles.--Section 2613(d) of such 
title is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)(B), by striking ``; or'' and inserting 
        a semicolon;
            (2) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting ``; or''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(3) facilitating the adoption of a military working dog 
        under section 2583 of this title.''.

SEC. 4. RECOGNITION OF SERVICE OF MILITARY WORKING DOGS.

    Section 1125 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``(a) General Authority.--'' before ``The 
        Secretary of Defense''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(b) Recognition of Service of Military Working Dogs.--The 
Secretary of Defense shall create a decoration or other appropriate 
recognition to recognize military working dogs under the jurisdiction 
of the Secretary that are killed in action or perform an exceptionally 
meritorious or courageous act in service to the United States.''.

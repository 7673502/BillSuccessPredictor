_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To authorize the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to make 
grants to nonprofit community organizations for the development of open 
         space on municipally owned vacant lots in urban areas.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Revitalizing Cities Through Parks 
Enhancement Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) open spaces and community parks are a critically 
        important portion of urban infrastructure;
            (2) many inner-city areas suffer from a lack of public open 
        space for community residents to use for recreation, social 
        interaction, and relief from dense urban conditions;
            (3) vacant lots, many in public ownership as a result of 
        tax foreclosures, are common in inner-city areas;
            (4) the recent economic recession substantially increased 
        the number of such vacant lots;
            (5) such lots often become drug trafficking areas, thereby 
        decreasing the value of surrounding property and leading to 
        higher crime rates in inner-city areas; and
            (6) the refurbishment of such lots, by removing garbage and 
        rubble and creating well-lighted and maintained open spaces and 
        community parks, would establish positive assets for 
        surrounding communities, provide positive outlets for community 
        youth, increase property values, make other types of investment 
        in the communities more attractive, and generally improve the 
        quality of life for residents of the affected communities.

SEC. 3. AUTHORITY TO MAKE GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 
shall, to the extent amounts are provided in appropriation Acts 
pursuant to section 13, make grants under this Act to qualified 
community organizations for establishment of community open space in 
urban areas.
    (b) Amount.--The aggregate amount of any grants made under this Act 
to any single qualified community organization in any single fiscal 
year may not exceed $250,000.

SEC. 4. QUALIFIED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.

    A grant under this Act may be made only to a nonprofit organization 
that--
            (1) has among its purposes significant activities related 
        to the improvement of the neighborhood, community, or city in 
        which any property that is to be assisted with the grant under 
        this Act is located;
            (2) has a history of serving such neighborhood, community, 
        or city;
            (3) maintains, through significant representation on the 
        organization's governing board and otherwise, accountability to 
        residents of such neighborhood, community, or city; and

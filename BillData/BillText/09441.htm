  To direct the National Institute of Justice to collect, study, and 
 analyze online content created by mass shooters in an effort to early 
                   identify potential mass shooters.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Identifying Mass Shooters Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Perpetrators of mass shootings have utilized various 
        online channels to declare their intent to commit violence 
        through manifestos, blog posts, social media posts, and direct 
        messages prior to committing acts of terror.
            (2) Inadequate oversight and accountability mechanisms on 
        online platforms creates an environment that enables hate 
        speech, extremism, radicalization, and violence.
            (3) In 2018, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 
        shooter posted a video on YouTube stating his desire to be a 
        ``professional school shooter,'' and proceeded to share photos 
        of himself posing with guns, along with troubling photos on 
        Instagram of his weapons arsenal and an animal he tortured, 
        prior to murdering 17 student and school staff members.
            (4) In 2018, the Santa Fe High School shooter posted a 
        Facebook photo of a t-shirt with ``Born to Kill,'' and images 
        of Nazi and satanic symbols prior to murdering 10 students and 
        school staff members.
            (5) In 2022, the Buffalo Tops grocery store shooter 
        declared on Discord, ``I will carry out an attack,'', posted a 
        manifesto on 4chan, and then livestreamed the murder of 10 
        Black people in a racially motivated shooting.
            (6) In 2022, the Robb Elementary School shooter posted a 
        photo of a hand holding a gun magazine, 2 semi-automatic 
        rifles, a TikTok profile that warned ``Kids be scared,'' and 
        sent a direct message though Yubo notifying an individual of 
        his intent to kill prior to murdering 21 children and staff 
        members.
            (7) The First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs shooter 
        demonstrated a fascination with mass shootings and launched 
        personal attacks on Facebook prior to murdering 26 churchgoers, 
        including an unborn child.

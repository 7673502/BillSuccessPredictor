        restore the shorelines of the United States, which include each 
        beach and shore of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Gulf of 
        Mexico, the Great Lakes, and lakes, estuaries, and bays 
        directly connected to those bodies of water, from the damaging 
        impacts of climate change and other factors contributing to the 
        vulnerability of coastal communities and ecosystems;
            (2) the protection and restoration of shores, and of the 
        banks of rivers and streams, from erosion and other damaging 
        forces exacerbated by climate change shall be restored to a 
        primary mission of the Corps of Engineers in carrying out water 
        resources development projects;
            (3) projects and measures for the protection and 
        restoration of shores, and of the banks of rivers and streams, 
        shall be formulated to increase the resilience of such shores, 
        and of such banks, from the damaging impacts of climate change 
        and other factors contributing to the vulnerability of coastal 
        and riverine communities and ecosystems using measures 
        described in section 1184(a) of the Water Resources Development 
        Act of 2016 (33 U.S.C. 2289a(a)) to the maximum extent

        out for the purpose of restoring and increasing the resilience 
        of ecosystems to the same extent as periodic nourishment is 
        provided for projects and measures carried out for the purpose 
        of coastal storm risk management.

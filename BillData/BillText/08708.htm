    Funds authorized to be appropriated pursuant to section 7 should be

            (1) For the Department of State, such funds should be the 
        responsibility of the Assistant Secretary of State for 
        Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, except for funds provided 
        to the NED. Such funds shall be made available as grants and 
        should have as their primary purpose democracy programs that 
        are incorporated into a larger diplomatic strategy and are 
        flexible, innovative, and responsive to--
                    (A) current human rights abuses and democracy 
                deficiencies as documented in the annual Country Report 
                on Human Rights Practices required by sections 116(d) 
                and 502B(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
                U.S.C. 2151n(d), 2304(b)); and
                    (B) emerging opportunities and sudden crises.
            (2) For USAID, such funds should have as their primary 
        purpose flexible, innovative, and responsive democracy programs 
        that are development-oriented, often coordinated through a 
        Country Development Cooperation Strategy, and conducted in 
        countries where a USAID Mission is present or a where a USAID 
        Mission in a neighboring country can manage and oversee such 
        programs effectively. Such programs should, as appropriate, 
        build enduring local capacity, incorporate democracy 
        programming into a larger development and diplomatic strategy, 
        and emphasize participatory and locally led programs when 
        possible. Funds made available for civil society and political 
        competition and consensus building programs abroad shall be 
        provided in a manner that recognizes the benefits of grants and 
        cooperative agreements in implementing such programs.
            (3) In cases where both the Department of State and USAID 
        are able to respond to emerging opportunities and sudden 
        crises, including in closed and repressive societies, the 
        Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator shall coordinate 
        their respective programs, including at the country level, to 
        ensure complementarity and prevent waste or redundancy.

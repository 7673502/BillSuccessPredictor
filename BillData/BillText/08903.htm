                                 A BILL


 
  To reauthorize United States-Israel cooperation to counter unmanned 
                            aerial systems.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel Cooperation to 
Counter Unmanned Aerial Systems Reauthorization and Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) remain a threat to Israel 
        and to the United States.
            (2) Israel played a crucial role in the early development 
        of UAS technology and is today still one of the top global 
        innovators in this area.
            (3) Since the establishment of the authority to provide 
        United States-Israel cooperation to counter unmanned aerial 
        systems under section 1278 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (22 U.S.C. 8606 note), 
        new technologies have been developed and are currently deployed 
        by the elements of the Department of Defense and the Department 
        of Homeland Security.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF UNITED STATES-ISRAEL COOPERATION TO COUNTER 
              UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS.

    Section 1278(f) of the National Defense Authorization Act, 2020 
(Public Law 116-92; 133 Stat. 1702) is amended by striking ``December 
31, 2024'' and inserting ``December 31, 2026''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

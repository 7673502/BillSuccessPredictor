                                 A BILL


 
To promote long-term economic recovery and job creation in underserved 
      communities by providing for investment in catalytic local 
predevelopment projects for resilient climate infrastructure innovation 
     and to provide assistance to support State and local project 
                  development, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Infrastructure Funding & 
Technical assistance Act'' or the ``LIFT Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) infrastructure systems in the United States are in a 
        period of significant disrepair and are increasingly 
        vulnerable;
            (2) aging infrastructure, new technologies, increasing 
        complexity, and increasing incidents of severe weather pose new 
        challenges to the resilience of those infrastructure systems;
            (3) the climate resilience challenge is most acute in 
        underserved communities in the United States, which face a 
        chronic underinvestment in infrastructure systems and require 
        restorative investments to rebuild with equity;
            (4) in purchasing infrastructure, the Federal Government 
        typically accepts a low-cost capital bid without a plan for 
        maintaining an asset that is designed to last 30 to 40 years, 
        such that investing in local best practices and capacity for 
        better procurement, asset management, design, lifecycle 
        finance, and innovative data and sensor systems will partially 
        address the resilient infrastructure funding crisis in the 
        United States;
            (5) experts have determined that predevelopment funding at 
        the local and project levels is the critical gap in 
        accelerating efforts of the Federal Government--
                    (A) to support climate-resilient infrastructure 
                systems and regional economies; and
                    (B) to create a steady stream of ``shovel-worthy'' 
                and well-maintained community projects;
            (6) economic analyses have determined that existing Federal 
        and State predevelopment programs generate as much as $16 to 
        $20 in economic activity for every $1 of public funds expended;
            (7) studies demonstrate that the development of stronger 
        lifecycle infrastructure methods by State and local project 
        sponsors will likely help local governments better leverage 
        current and future Federal taxpayer investment in public 
        infrastructure through partnerships with impact investors;
            (8) well-managed and resilient regional, State, and local 
        infrastructure assets will lower future Federal taxpayer costs 
        for recovery and restoration efforts;
            (9) States and regions have unique infrastructure systems 
        and challenges, such as--
                    (A) hurricanes and flooding along the coasts;
                    (B) wildfires and droughts in the West;
                    (C) failing dams and levees in the Midwest and 
                Mississippi regions;
                    (D) stormwater management issues in the East; and
                    (E) broadband connectivity in the Intermountain 
                region;
            (10) the interconnected nature of energy, water, building 
        stock, transportation, and communication systems demands new 
        investments and innovations--
                    (A) to prepare for mitigating risks and 
                cyberattacks; and
                    (B) to carry out integrated deployment strategies;
            (11) the basic infrastructure needs of many communities are 
        changing during the COVID-19 era to emphasize distance learning 
        and public health, while much of the infrastructure stock of 
        the United States created in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s is 
        aging;
            (12) \2/3\ of United States infrastructure is funded at the 
        State and local levels;
            (13) the Federal Government, in the role of a long-term 
        strategic infrastructure partner, should focus on making 
        catalytic investments that--
                    (A) promote local best practices in resilient 
                infrastructure through performance-based investments in 
                States and communities;
                    (B) encourage regional innovation, innovative 
                partnerships, and economic resilience strategies and 
                outcomes that fund long-term capacity building and 
                economic recovery; and
                    (C) provide strategic capacity building resources, 
                technical assistance, and flexible predevelopment 
                support for resilient infrastructure project 
                development that allows States and communities to 
                accelerate the most critical State and community 
                infrastructure needs; and
            (14) grantees and applicants of the Assistance for Coal 
        Communities program of the Economic Development Administration 
        have expressed financial hardship with meeting all project 
        predevelopment costs needed to be eligible for that program and 
        to transition away from fossil fuel infrastructure.
    (b) Purpose.--Recognizing that pressing climate infrastructure 
needs differ by State and region, and that Federal program support for 
project predevelopment is limited or inflexible due to programmatic 
silos, the purpose of this Act is to establish new, flexible funding 
streams and expedited processes--
            (1) to accelerate timely, resilient infrastructure 
        deployment, specifically in underserved communities;
            (2) to reduce taxpayer costs in response to disasters 
        involving infrastructure; and
            (3) to preserve existing jobs and to create new jobs.

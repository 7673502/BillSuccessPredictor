        To end COVID-19 lockdowns and COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``End Lockdowns and Vaccine Mandates 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) States and localities have violated the rights of 
        American citizens to assemble by refusing them entry into 
        churches, places of business, and entertainment venues.
            (2) States and localities have restricted the rights of 
        American citizens by denying men and women the ability to earn 
        a living and provide for a family through forced inoculation of 
        the COVID-19 vaccine.

SEC. 3. ENDING LOCKDOWNS; ALLOWING THE UNVACCINATED TO PARTICIPATE IN 
              NORMAL LIFE.

    A State, a political subdivision thereof, and the Federal 
Government, may not forbid people in the hopes of containing a 
communicable disease from--
            (1) entering or remaining in a place of business, including 
        but not limited to restaurants, movie theaters, stadiums, or 
        concert venues; or
            (2) opening their places of business or selling goods or 
        services at a physical location.

SEC. 4. ENDING VACCINE MANDATES.

    A State, a political subdivision thereof, or the Federal Government 
may not--
            (1) make a condition of employment whether someone has been 
        inoculated with a vaccine; or
            (2) discriminate in employment, including but not limited 
        to reducing wages, refusing to increase wages, or refusing a 
        promotion, based on whether an individual has been inoculated 
        or will be inoculated with a vaccine.

SEC. 5. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

    A citizen of the United States who has experienced violations under 
this Act may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial 
proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against the Federal 
Government, a State, or a locality.

SEC. 6. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS.

    (a) In General.--No Federal funds are authorized to be appropriated 
or otherwise made available to a State or political subdivision under 
any program for which appropriations are provided on a discretionary 
basis if the head of the Federal department or agency administering 
such program determines that such State or political subdivision has 
violated any provision of this Act.
    (b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to 
alter, affect, or otherwise limit any Federal payment to which an 
individual is entitled under a provision of law.

SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY.

    The provisions of this legislation shall be deemed severable and 
the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect 
the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof.

SEC. 8. DEFINITION OF A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE.

    In this Act, the term ``communicable disease'' is a disease that 
can spread from one person to another through direct or indirect 
contact.

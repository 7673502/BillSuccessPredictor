    (a) In General.--Section 1128D(a) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1320a-7d(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph:
            ``(3) Review of safe harbor for certain contingency 
        management interventions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Pursuant to the final rule 
                titled `Medicare and State Health Care Programs: Fraud 
                and Abuse; Revisions to Safe Harbors Under the Anti-
                Kickback Statute, and Civil Monetary Penalty Rules 
                Regarding Beneficiary Inducements' and published in the 
                Federal Register on December 2, 2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 
                77684), not later than one year after the date of the 
                enactment of this paragraph, the Inspector General of 
                the Department of Health and Human Services shall 
                conduct a review on whether to establish a safe harbor 
                described in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) for evidence-based 
                contingency management incentives and the parameters 
                for such a safe harbor. In conducting the review under 
                the previous sentence, the Secretary shall consider the 
                extent to which providing such a safe harbor for 
                evidence-based contingency management incentives may 
                result in any of the factors described in paragraph 
                (2).
                    ``(i) Report.--Not later than two years after the 
                date of the enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary 
                and the Inspector General of the Department of Health 
                and Human Services shall submit to Congress 
                recommendations, including based on the review 
                conducted under subparagraph (A), for improving access 
                to evidence-based contingency management interventions 
                while ensuring quality of care, ensuring fidelity to 
                evidence-based practices, and including strong program 
                integrity safeguards that prevent increased waste, 
                fraud, and abuse and prevent medically unnecessary or 
                inappropriate items or services reimbursed in whole or 
                in part by a Federal health care program.''.

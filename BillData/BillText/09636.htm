    ``(d) Prompt Refunds for Cancelled Flights.--
            ``(1) In general.--It shall be an unfair or deceptive 
        practice under subsection (a) for any air carrier, foreign air 
        carrier, or ticket agent that sells a ticket for air 
        transportation to fail to provide a covered refund with respect 
        to such ticket if the air transportation is cancelled or 
        significantly changed.
            ``(2) Exclusion.--Paragraph (1) does not apply if a ticket 
        holder voluntarily accepts alternative transportation or other 
        compensation offered in lieu of a covered refund.
            ``(3) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    ``(A) Covered refund.--The term `covered refund' 
                means a refund of the amount paid for a ticket for air 
                transportation that is provided--
                            ``(i) to the holder of the ticket;
                            ``(ii) in the same format in which the 
                        amount was paid; and

                                electronic format, 48 hours after the 
                                relevant cancellation or significant 
                                change; or
                                    ``(II) in the case of payment by 
                                cash or check, 14 days after the 
                                relevant cancellation or significant 
                                change.

                        associated with such transportation has 
                        changed--
                                    ``(I) in the case of air 
                                transportation within the United 
                                States, by 3 or more hours; or
                                    ``(II) in the case of air 
                                transportation to or from a location 
                                outside the United States, by 6 or more 
                                hours;
                            ``(ii) the departure or arrival airport 
                        associated with such transportation has 
                        changed;
                            ``(iii) the number of intermediate stops 
                        associated with such transportation has 
                        increased; or
                            ``(iv) the type of aircraft associated with 
                        such transportation has changed and, as 
                        determined by the Secretary, the change will 
                        result in a significant downgrade of the air 
                        transportation experience.''.

Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (5)(D), the amount of a civil 
penalty for a violation of section 41712(d) shall be the amount that is 
10 times the amount paid for the relevant cancelled or significantly 
changed air transportation.''.

    To prevent recognition of the Taliban-controlled government of 
                  Afghanistan, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Taliban Recognition Prevention 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PREVENTION OF RECOGNITION OF TALIBAN-CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT OF 
              AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Taliban maintains a close partnership with al Qaeda 
        and other terrorist organizations that pose a threat to the 
        national security interests of the United States; and
            (2) the President should not--
                    (A) extend diplomatic recognition to the Taliban-
                controlled government of Afghanistan;
                    (B) provide any funds to the Taliban, directly or 
                indirectly; or
                    (C) act to relieve any bilateral or multilateral 
                sanctions on the Taliban or Taliban leaders.
    (b) Recognition Prevention.--The Secretary of State shall instruct, 
as appropriate, the representative of the United States Government for 
each international organization in which the United States participates 
to use the voice, vote, and influence of the United States to advocate 
that such organization not recognize the Taliban-controlled government 
of Afghanistan.
    (c) Inclusion of Subordinate Organizations.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``Taliban'' includes--
            (1) subordinate organizations, including the Haqqani 
        Network; and
            (2) any successor organization.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

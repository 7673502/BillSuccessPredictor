SEC. 303. GAO REVIEW OF FACTORS TO DETERMINE ASSISTANCE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall issue a 
report describing the factors the Agency considers when evaluating a 
request from a Governor to declare that a major disaster or emergency 
exists and to authorize assistance under sections 402, 403, 406, 407, 
408, 428, and 502 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170a et seq.).
    (b) Contents.--The report issued under subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) an assessment of--
                    (A) the degree to which the factors the Agency 
                considers when evaluating a request for a major 
                disaster or emergency declaration--
                            (i) affect equity for underserved 
                        communities, particularly with respect to major 
                        disaster and emergency declaration requests, 
                        approvals of such requests, and the 
                        authorization of assistance described in 
                        subsection (a); and
                            (ii) are designed to deliver equitable 
                        outcomes;
                    (B) how the Agency utilizes such factors or 
                monitors whether such factors result in equitable 
                outcomes;
                    (C) the extent to which major disaster and 
                emergency declaration requests, approvals of such 
                requests, and the authorization of assistance described 
                in subsection (a), are more highly correlated with 
                high-income counties compared to lower-income counties;
                    (D) whether the process and administrative steps 
                for conducting preliminary damage assessments are 
                equitable; and
                    (E) to the extent practicable, whether such factors 
                may deter a Governor from seeking a major disaster or 
                emergency declaration for potentially eligible 
                counties; and
            (2) a consideration of the extent to which such factors 
        affect underserved communities--
                    (A) of varying size;
                    (B) with varying population density and demographic 
                characteristics;
                    (C) with limited emergency management staff and 
                resources; and
                    (D) located in urban or rural areas.
    (c) Recommendations.--The Comptroller General shall include in the 
report issued under subsection (a) any recommendations for changes to 
the factors the Agency considers when evaluating a request for a major 
disaster or emergency declaration to account for underserved 
communities.

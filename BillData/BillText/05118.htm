                        reference conditions, including management 
                        prescriptions and necessary mitigation measures 
                        to protect at-risk species;
                            (v) be based on the best available 
                        scientific information and data, including, 
                        where applicable, high-resolution imagery, 
                        LiDAR, and similar technologies and 
                        information, and involve direct engagement by 
                        scientists; and
                            (vi) identify priority restoration 
                        strategies for terrestrial and aquatic areas, 
                        including prescribed fire and wildfires managed 
                        for multiple resource benefits, which shall 
                        focus on--
                                    (I) areas that are the most 
                                departed from reference conditions; and
                                    (II) areas that would benefit the 
                                most from reducing the risk of 
                                uncharacteristic wildfire, especially 
                                with respect to nearby communities, 
                                taking into account other completed, 
                                ongoing, planned fuels-reduction 
                                projects, and the effects of recent 
                                wildfires.
                    (D) Restoration treatments under the project--
                            (i) shall emphasize the reintroduction of 
                        characteristic fire, based on forest ecology 
                        and reference conditions, through the use of 
                        prescribed fire, wildfire, or both;
                            (ii) that involve any proposed mechanical 
                        treatments shall be designed to promote--
                                    (I) the restoration of reference 
                                conditions in areas that lack 
                                ecological integrity, with a focus on 
                                the reduction of surface and ladder 
                                fuels; and
                                    (II) the establishment of 
                                conditions that will facilitate 
                                prescribed fire or managed wildfire;
                            (iii) shall--
                                    (I) fully maintain or contribute to 
                                the restoration of reference old forest 
                                conditions, taking into account the 
                                current and projected impacts of 
                                climate change; and
                                    (II) protect or increase the number 
                                and distribution of large old trees, 
                                consistent with reference conditions, 
                                excepting any de minimis losses of 
                                large old trees from prescribed fire or 
                                hazardous tree removal; and
                            (iv) that involve prescribed fire shall 
                        provide advance notification, in accordance 
                        with notification procedures developed by the

        if the projects--
                    (A) fully comply with the requirements described in 
                subparagraphs (B), (D), (E), (F), (G), (H), and (I) of 
                that paragraph;
                    (B) in the determination of the Secretary of 
                Agriculture, have purposes and needs that are 
                consistent with the purposes and needs described in 
                subparagraph (A) of that paragraph; and
                    (C) are supported by landscape assessments that are 
                substantially (if not completely) consistent with the 
                requirements described in subparagraph (C) of that 
                paragraph, subject to the condition that the applicable 
                landscape assessments fully comply with the 
                requirements described in clauses (i) and (v) of that 
                subparagraph.
    (d) Evaluation of Eligible Projects.--
            (1) In general.--In determining which landscape-scale 
        forest restoration projects to select under subsection (a), the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall consider--
                    (A) the criteria described in paragraph (2);
                    (B) the extent to which the project utilizes the 
                approaches to project implementation described in 
                paragraph (3); and
                    (C) the recommendations of the advisory panel 
                established under subsection (e).
            (2) Criteria.--The criteria referred to in paragraph (1)(A) 
        are--
                    (A) the demonstrated need, based on the best 
                available science, to restore ecological integrity to 
                degraded or departed areas within the landscape covered 
                by the project, taking into account the current and 
                projected impacts of climate change;
                    (B)(i) the importance of watersheds in the area 
                covered by the project for downstream waters supply; 
                and

                        contributions;
                    (D) whether the area covered by the project has 
                high-resolution, remote-sensing data and other 
                information available that enables a landscape 
                assessment and a robust analysis and disclosure of the 
                effects and outcomes of implementing restoration 
                activities;
                    (E) whether the project is using, or will use,

                that are less costly and less time-consuming than usual 
                practices while providing the information necessary for 
                project design and analysis;
                    (F) whether the project will reduce the number of 
                miles of permanent roads on National Forest System land 
                that are not necessary for resource management or 
                recreational access;
                    (G) whether the project will assess or quantify the 
                ecosystem service benefits of forest restoration within 
                the landscape covered by the project, such as water, 
                carbon, biodiversity, fire risk reduction, public 
                health, and community safety;
                    (H) whether the project has the potential to 
                support new or existing wood processing infrastructure 
                that can make economic use of the byproducts of forest 
                restoration;
                    (I) whether the project has the potential to 
                support local employment and investment opportunities, 
                particularly in economically disadvantaged communities;
                    (J) the scale of the landscape assessment for the 
                project, with a preference for projects for which the 
                landscape assessment covers a larger area; and
                    (K) whether the project--
                            (i) strives to restore ecological integrity 
                        and ecological conditions within areas across 
                        land ownerships, including State and private 
                        land; and
                            (ii) will reduce the risk of 
                        uncharacteristic wildfire, and, to the extent 
                        practicable, restore ecological integrity, 
                        within the wildland-urban interface.
            (3) Collaboration.--The Secretary of Agriculture may 
        coordinate with Federal, State, local, and Tribal agencies with

             TITLE III--OPEN ACCESS EVAPOTRANSPIRATION DATA

SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Open Access Evapotranspiration 
Data Act''.

SEC. 302. DEFINITIONS.

    In this title:
            (1) Evapotranspiration.--The term ``evapotranspiration'' or 
        ``ET'' means the process by which water is transferred from the 
        land to the atmosphere by--
                    (A) evaporation from soil and other surfaces; and
                    (B) transpiration from plants.

        Evapotranspiration (OpenET) Data Program established under 
        section 304(a).
            (3) Program partner.--The term ``Program partner'' means--
                    (A) an institution of higher education;
                    (B) a State (including a State agency);
                    (C) an Indian Tribe as defined in section 4 of the 
                Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act 
                (25 U.S.C. 5304);

            (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of the Interior, acting through the Director of the United 
        States Geological Survey.

SEC. 303. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) evapotranspiration is the second largest component of 
        the water budget, which is an accounting of the allocation of 
        water resources to various water uses;
            (2) evapotranspiration is a measure of the water that is 
        consumed and lost from a water system, removed from available 
        supplies, and unavailable for other uses within a watershed;
            (3) accurate information on evapotranspiration is required 
        to balance water supply and water demand in a watershed and 
        ensure that adequate water supplies for beneficial uses are 
        available over time;
            (4) water users and managers are impeded in more efficient 
        decision making by--
                    (A) the lack of consistent and comprehensive water 
                use data; and
                    (B) the fact that access to existing data is often 
                limited and cost-prohibitive; and
            (5) evapotranspiration data may be applied for the purposes 
        of--
                    (A) assisting users and decisionmakers to better 
                manage resources and protect financial viability of 
                farm operations during drought;
                    (B) developing more accurate water budgets and 
                innovative management programs to better promote 
                conservation and sustainability efforts; and
                    (C) employing greater groundwater management 
                practices and understanding impacts of consumptive 
                water use.

                areas are considered subject to a fire risk.
                    (D) An analysis of whether other mitigation 
                measures are more cost-effective than relocation 
                assistance when the applicant is applying to move from 
                a high-risk to a medium-risk or low-risk area with 
                respect to wildfires.
                    (E) An analysis of the need for the Federal 
                Government to produce wildfire maps that identify high-
                risk, moderate-risk, and low-risk wildfire zones.
                    (F) An analysis of whether other mitigation 
                measures promote greater resilience to wildfires when 
                compared to relocation or, if additional data is 
                required in order to carry out such an analysis, a 
                discussion of the additional data required.

                governments, and Indian tribal governments to 
                demonstrate fire risk, and whether the level of this 
                ability impacts the ability of States, local 
                governments, or Indian tribal governments to access 
                relocation assistance, including an assessment of 
                existing fire mapping products and capabilities and

                        cost analysis determinations by the Agency;
                            (iii) what additional data, if any, may be 
                        pertinent to such determinations; and

                        effectiveness.
                    (I) A discussion of the extent to which the

                    (J) An analysis of whether statutes and regulations 
                regarding relocation assistance by the Agency present 
                barriers for States, local governments, or Indian 
                tribal governments trying to access funding to reduce 
                wildfire risk.

                        mitigation projects with respect to wildfires;
                            (ii) the cost effectiveness of such 
                        projects, in light of the increasing losses and 
                        obligations for wildfires in recent years; and
                            (iii) the effectiveness of any 
                        modifications described in clause (i).
                    (L) An analysis of how, if at all, recent changes 
                in the availability of fire insurance has resulted in 
                modifications of policy or procedure with respect to 
                determining the cost efficacy of relocation assistance 
                for wildfires.
                    (M) An analysis of how to define repetitive loss 
                and repetitively damaged properties in the context of 
                wildfires.
                    (N) A discussion of whether any legislative, 
                regulatory, or policy changes are necessary for the 
                Agency to better implement relocation assistance to 
                reduce risk from wildfires.

              TITLE II--NATIONAL DISASTER SAFETY BOARD ACT

SEC. 201. ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Organization.--There is established in the executive branch a 
National Disaster Safety Board, which shall be an independent 
establishment, as defined in section 104 of title 5, United States 
Code.
    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of the Board are--
            (1) to reduce loss of life, injury, and economic injury 
        caused by future incidents by learning from natural hazards, 
        including the impacts and underlying factors of such incidents, 
        in a standardized way;
            (2) to maintain a focus that is future-looking and national 
        in scope, by applying what the Board learns through the trends 
        that emerge from the incidents the Board reviews nationally to 
        prevent loss of life, or human or economic injury, not only in 
        the affected jurisdiction, but nationally, as the Board 
        determines relevant;
            (3) in carrying out reviews, analyses, and recommendations, 
        not to be accusatory in nature and the Board shall not seek to 
        find blame in any individual or organization, or second-guess 
        any relevant authorities;
            (4) to address systemic causes behind the loss of life and 
        human or economic injury in incidents, including by 
        recommending the augmentation of resources available to 
        entities responsible for managing incident consequences; and
            (5) while preventing economic injury as part of the mission 
        of the Board, when relevant, to prioritize efforts that focus 
        on lifesaving and injury prevention, especially in 
        disproportionately impacted communities, as its work determines 
        them to be.

SEC. 202. GENERAL AUTHORITY.

    (a) Authority To Review.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to subsection (b), the Board shall 
        review and establish the facts, circumstances, and cause or 
        probable cause of the loss of life, human injury, and economic 
        injury due to a natural hazard with 10 or more fatalities or 
        that meets the requirements described in paragraph (5) or (6) 
        of subsection (b) that occurs after the date of enactment of 
        this Act.
            (2) Due to a natural hazard incident defined.--For purposes 
        of paragraph (1), the term ``due to a natural hazard'' means a 
        fatality that, if not for the natural hazard incident, as the 
        case may be, would not have occurred within the time frame of 
        the incident, as defined by standards developed by the Board.
    (b) Determination of Whether Incident Warrants Board Review.--In 
carrying out subsection (a), the Board--
            (1) may begin the review of an incident, including by 
        monitoring the natural hazard and collecting facts, before the 
        total number of fatalities is known if the Board determines 
        that the natural hazard incident has the potential to cause 10 
        or more fatalities at its onset, in accordance with the 
        policies and procedures established by the Board;
            (2) may, by a two-thirds vote, decide that an incident that 
        caused 10 or more fatalities does not require a review and 
        shall issue a public statement explaining the determination;
            (3) may, by a majority vote, decide to review any natural 
        hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this 
        Act upon request from a representative of an affected State, 
        Tribal government, or unit of local government, regardless of 
        the number of fatalities;
            (4) may, by a majority vote, decide to review any natural 
        hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this 
        Act upon recommendation by the Office for the Protection of 
        Disproportionately Impacted Communities of the Board, which the 
        Office may make because of the incident's impacts on 
        populations that are socially, medically, or economically 
        vulnerable, as decided by the Office; and
            (5) may, by a majority vote, decide to review a natural 
        hazard incident that occurs after the date of enactment of this 
        Act if--
                    (A) the Board determines that information may be 
                gained by the review that will be useful in reducing 
                systemic causes behind the loss of life and human or 
                economic injury; and
                    (B) the incident--
                            (i) did not result in 10 or more 
                        fatalities; and
                            (ii)(I) could have resulted in a large 
                        number of fatalities if not for swift 
                        intervention or a shift in the course of 
                        events; or
                            (II) resulted in, as determined by the 
                        Board--
                                    (aa) a significant amount of 
                                economic or infrastructure damage;
                                    (bb) significant human 
                                displacement; or
                                    (cc) a significant number of severe 
                                non-fatal injuries or cases of severe 
                                illness; and
            (6) shall, by majority vote, determine whether each 
        incident for which the President issues a major disaster 
        declaration under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford 
        Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) 
        meets the criteria for review under paragraph (5).

        the Board shall--
                    (A) conduct the review to determine the facts, 
                conditions, and circumstances relating to the loss of 
                life, human injury, and economic injury due to an 
                incident;
                    (B) following an initial assessment of an incident 
                by the Board, notify any individual or organization 
                that the Board anticipates will be affected by the 
                review as to the extent of the expected review response 
                of the Board;

                            (ii) issue recommendations to prevent or 
                        mitigate the loss of life, human injury, or 
                        economic injury due to similar incidents; and
                    (D) report on the facts and circumstances of the

                    (B) focus on trends across an incident; and
                    (C) not aim to determine the exact individual cause

            (3) Fact-finding proceeding.--Any review of an incident by 
        the Board under this title shall be a fact-finding proceeding

                        Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.); or
                            (ii) conducted for the purpose of 
                        determining the rights, liabilities, or blame 
                        of any person, as the review is not an 
                        adjudicatory proceeding.
                    (B) Paperwork reduction act.--Chapter 35 of title

        sustaining efforts underway by other entities.
            (6) Alignment and coordination.--In carrying out this 
        title, the Board shall coordinate with Federal, State, local,

                    (A) establish or adopt standard methods of 
                measuring the impacts of natural hazards and accessing 
                response capacity and capabilities to maintain 
                consistency and allow for the analysis of trends over 
                time;
                    (B) ensure that the standard data sets and formats 
                necessary for reviews developed under subparagraph (A)

                involved in response operations to avoid any 
                duplication of data collection; and
                    (D) during incident response operations, coordinate 
                with partners active in the operation to collect data 
                remotely or take other actions that the Board finds 
                necessary to align and coordinate the requirements of 
                the review with ongoing operations, including through 
                the requirements of paragraph (7).
            (7) Incident command.--The Board shall--
                    (A) recognize the role of incident command systems 
                to address incidents;
                    (B) observe the incident command system to identify 
                and coordinate review needs related to the preservation 
                and collection of information and evidence; and
                    (C) shall collect information and evidence from the 
                incident command in a timely and reasonable manner so 
                as not to interfere with the operations of the incident 
                command.

                participant shall be required to follow all directions 
                and instructions from the Board.
                    (B) Eligible entity.--In designating an entity to

                designate only a Federal, State, or local government 
                agency or private organization whose employees, 
                functions, activities, or products were involved in the 
                incident, including responsible parties, and that can 
                provide suitable qualified technical personnel to

                    (E) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to establish a right for 
                any entity to participate in a Board review as a party.
                    (F) Internal review by a party.--To assure

        recommendations with any useful additional information or 
        context provided by any affected jurisdiction in its comments 
        without affecting the integrity or independence of the review 
        and its findings and recommendations, as the Board shall 
        determine.
    (e) Disproportionately Impacted Communities.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out a review of an incident 
        under this section, including in determining whether to launch

        human or economic injury to populations that are socially, 
        medically, or economically vulnerable, as decided by the Board.
            (2) Data requirement.--To forward the analysis and 
        identification of trends of fatalities and injuries as a result 
        of incidents, the Board shall publish information regarding the 
        number of fatalities and injuries, and the facts and 
        circumstances surrounding them, disaggregated by race, color or 
        ethnicity, religion, nationality, sex, age, disability, English 
        proficiency, occupation, or economic status, and other

        government.
            (2) Participation by other agencies.--The Board shall

        injury caused by future incidents are produced as efficiently 
        as possible.
            (4) Memoranda of understanding.--Not later than 1 year

        Transportation Safety Board, respectively, and may enter into 
        additional memoranda of understanding with any other Federal 
        entity that requests such due to the relationship that the 
        requirements of the Federal entity may have with the 
        requirements with the Board, in order to--
                    (A) determine the appropriate roles and

                agency, or other Federal investigative body with 
                statutory authority to lead such an investigation, if 
                the head of the lead investigative agency determines 
                that the participation of the Board would be beneficial 
                to reduce the likelihood of the loss of life and human 
                or economic injury, for future similar incidents.

                                the participation of the Board would be 
                                beneficial to reduce the likelihood of 
                                the loss of life and human or economic 
                                injury, for future similar incidents; 
                                or

        (A) may have been caused by an intentional criminal act, the 
        Board shall relinquish investigative priority to the 
        responsible Federal law enforcement entity.
            (4) Rule of construction.--This section shall not be 
        construed to affect the authority of another department, 
        agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government to 
        investigate an incident under applicable law or to obtain 
        information directly from the parties involved in, and 
        witnesses to, the incident. The Board and other departments,

                technical assistance described in subparagraph (A) in 
                coordination with technical assistance offered by 
                another Federal department or agency.
            (3) Prioritization.--In offering technical assistance under

SEC. 113. PROTECTIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AGAINST 
              HARMFUL FEDERAL ACTIONS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish 
additional protections relating to Federal actions affecting 
environmental justice communities in recognition of the 
disproportionate burden of adverse human health or environmental 
effects faced by such communities.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Environmental impact statement.--The term 
        ``environmental impact statement'' means the detailed statement 
        of environmental impacts of a proposed action required to be 
        prepared pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 
        1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
            (2) Federal action.--The term ``Federal action'' means a 
        proposed action that requires the preparation of an 
        environmental impact statement, environmental assessment, 
        categorical exclusion, or other document under the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    (c) Preparation of a Community Impact Report.--A Federal agency 
proposing to take a Federal action that has the potential to cause 
negative environmental or public health impacts on an environmental 
justice community shall prepare a community impact report assessing the 
potential impacts of the proposed action.
    (d) Contents.--A community impact report described in subsection 
(c) shall--
            (1) assess the degree to which a proposed Federal action 
        affecting an environmental justice community will cause 
        multiple or cumulative exposure to human health and 
        environmental hazards that influence, exacerbate, or contribute 
        to adverse health outcomes;
            (2) assess relevant public health data and industry data 
        concerning the potential for multiple or cumulative exposure to 
        human health or environmental hazards in the area of the 
        environmental justice community and historical patterns of 
        exposure to environmental hazards and Federal agencies shall 
        assess these multiple, or cumulative effects, even if certain 
        effects are not within the control or subject to the discretion 
        of the Federal agency proposing the Federal action;
            (3) assess the impact of such proposed Federal action on 
        such environmental justice community's ability to access public 
        parks, outdoor spaces, and public recreation opportunities;
            (4) evaluate alternatives to or mitigation measures for the 
        proposed Federal action that will--
                    (A) eliminate or reduce any identified exposure to 
                human health and environmental hazards described in 
                paragraph (1) to a level that is reasonably expected to 
                avoid human health impacts in environmental justice 
                communities; and
                    (B) not negatively impact an environmental justice 
                community's ability to access public parks, outdoor 
                spaces, and public recreation opportunities; and
            (5) analyze any alternative developed by members of an 
        affected environmental justice community that meets the purpose 
        and need of the proposed action.
    (e) Delegation.--Federal agencies shall not delegate responsibility 
for the preparation of a community impact report described in 
subsection (c) to any other entity.
    (f) National Environmental Policy Act Requirements for 
Environmental Justice Communities.--When carrying out the requirements

                        activity.
    ``(B) With respect to demonstrating that a particular program, 
policy, practice, or activity does not cause a disparate impact, the 
covered entity shall demonstrate that each particular challenged 
program, policy, practice, or activity does not cause a disparate 
impact, except that if the covered entity demonstrates to the courts 
that the elements of the covered entity's decision-making process are 
not capable of separation for analysis, the decision-making process may 
be analyzed as 1 program, policy, practice, or activity.
    ``(2) A demonstration that a program, policy, practice, or activity 
is necessary to achieve the goals of a program, policy, practice, or 
activity may not be used as a defense against a claim of intentional 
discrimination under this title.

                    (A) the Attorney General shall have primary 
                responsibility for conducting the declassification 
                reviews required by subsection (a)(1) with respect to 
                documents and information that originated with the 
                Department of Justice;
                    (B) the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency 
                shall have primary responsibility for conducting the 
                declassification reviews required by such subsection 
                with respect to documents and information that 
                originated with the Central Intelligence Agency; and
                    (C) the Director of National Intelligence shall 
                have primary responsibility for conducting the 
                declassification reviews required by such subsection

                described in subparagraph (A) or (B).
            (2) Additional requirements.--Upon the completion of the 
        declassification reviews under subsection (a)(1), the Director 
        of National Intelligence shall, independently, ensure that, as

        declassified pursuant to the reviews--
                    (A) such documents and information meet 6 the

                declassified where the Federal Government's interest in 
                classification is outweighed by the public interest in 
                disclosure and transparency.

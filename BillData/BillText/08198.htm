    (a) In General.--Subsection (d) of section 3680A is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``(d)(1) The Secretary shall not approve the enrollment of any 
eligible veteran, not already enrolled, in any course for any period 
during which the Secretary finds that more than 85 percent of the 
students enrolled in the course are having all or part of their 
tuition, fees, or other charges paid to or for them by the educational 
institution or by the Department of Veterans Affairs under this title 
or under chapter 1606 of title 10, except with respect to tuition, 
fees, or other charges that are paid under a payment plan at an 
educational institution that the Secretary determines has a history of 
offering payment plans that are completed not later than 180 days after 
the end of the applicable term, quarter, or semester.
    ``(2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of paragraph (1), in 
whole or in part, if the Secretary determines, pursuant to regulations 
which the Secretary shall prescribe, it to be in the interest of the 
eligible veteran and the Federal Government.
    ``(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish a process by which an 
educational institution may request a review of a determination that 
the educational institution does not meet the requirements of paragraph 
(1).
    ``(B) An educational institution that requests a review under 
subparagraph (A)--
            ``(i) shall request the review not later than 30 days after 
        the start of the term, quarter, or semester for which the 
        determination described in subparagraph (A) applies; and
            ``(ii) may include any information that the educational 
        institution believes the Department should have taken into 
        account when making the determination, including with respect 
        to any mitigating circumstances.
    ``(C) The Under Secretary of Benefits shall issue an initial 
decision for each review requested under subparagraph (A) by not later 
than 30 days after the date of the request, to the extent feasible.
    ``(D) An educational institution may request the Secretary to 
review the decision by the Under Secretary under subparagraph (C). The 
Secretary shall review each decision so requested and, pursuant to such 
review, shall issue a final decision sustaining, modifying, or 
overturning the decision by the Under Secretary.
    ``(E) The Secretary shall carry out this paragraph without regard 
to any review process carried out by the Secretary under chapter 51 of 
this title.
    ``(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any course offered by an 
educational institution if--
            ``(A) the majority of courses offered by the educational 
        institution are approved under section 3672 or 3675 of this 
        title; and
            ``(B) the total number of veterans and persons receiving 
        assistance under this title or under chapter 1606 of title 10 
        who are enrolled in such institution equals 35 percent or less 
        of the total student enrollment at such institution (computed 
        separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of 
        such institution).
    ``(5)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any course offered by an 
educational institution if--

        institution are approved under section 3676 of this title; and
            ``(ii) the total number of veterans and persons receiving 
        assistance under this title or under chapter 1606 of title 10 
        who are enrolled in such institution equals 35 percent or less 
        of the total student enrollment at such institution (computed 
        separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of 
        such institution).
    ``(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), on a case by case basis, 
the Secretary may apply paragraph (1) with respect to any course 
otherwise covered by such subparagraph if the Secretary has reason to 
believe that the enrollment of veterans and persons described in clause 
(ii) of such subparagraph may be in excess of 85 percent of the total 
student enrollment in such course.
    ``(6) The Secretary shall ensure that an educational institution 
that meets the requirements of paragraph (4) or (5) submits information 
to the Secretary on a biennial basis to verify meeting such 
requirements. During such biennial period in which an educational 
institution is covered by such verification, the Secretary may not 
require the educational institution to submit information with respect 
to meeting the requirements of paragraph (1).
    ``(7) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to the enrollment 
of a veteran--
            ``(A) in a program of education for which fewer than 10 
        students are having all or part of their tuition, fees, or 
        other charges paid to or for them by the educational 
        institution or by the Department of Veterans Affairs under this 
        title or under chapter 1606 of title 10;
            ``(B) in a course offered pursuant to section 3019,

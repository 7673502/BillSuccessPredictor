        applicable agency libraries and the Library of Congress;
            (2) an outline of any issues with agency access to 
        scientific serials and subscriptions, which may include 
        contract issues, concerns arising with new publishing media 
        (including print, online, and aggregated services), the ability 
        of agency employees to use agency library subscriptions in 
        headquarters and regional offices, purchasing system 
        inefficiencies, and price concerns; and
            (3) recommendations on addressing issues, including short-
        term and long-term solutions and assessing the potential need

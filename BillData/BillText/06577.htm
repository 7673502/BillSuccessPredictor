        rate of the salary payable to an immigration judge during such 
        period as the number of years he has served as immigration 
        judge bears to 10; except that the rate of such retired pay

        had served as an immigration judge less than 10 years.
Such retired pay shall begin to accrue on the day following the day on 
which his salary as immigration judge ceases to accrue, and shall 
continue to accrue during the remainder of his life. Retired pay under 
this subsection shall be paid in the same manner as the salary of an 
immigration judge. In computing the rate of the retired pay under

thereto, that portion of the aggregate number of years he has served as 
an immigration judge which is a fractional part of 1 year shall be 
eliminated if it is less than 6 months, or shall be counted as a full 
year if it is 6 months or more. In computing the rate of the retired 
pay under paragraph (1) of this subsection for any individual who is 
entitled thereto, any period during which such individual performs 
services under subsection (c) on a substantially full-time basis shall 
be treated as a period during which he has served as an immigration

    ``(a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c), if the administrative 
council determines, based on specific and credible facts, that the 
current resources of the Immigration Courts are insufficient for the 
expeditious and effective administration of justice, the appellate 
division may exercise its authority en banc to--
            ``(1) appoint temporary immigration trial judges, which 
        appointment shall be undertaken in a manner consistent with the 
        requirements of section 602, to the extent practicable;

            ``(1) Eligibility.--A retired immigration judge may be 
        recalled for service if the judge provides to the clerk of the

        for service shall be paid at the rate of pay in effect under

        Committees named in paragraph (1) on the current status of the 
        Immigration Courts and the continuing need for the temporary

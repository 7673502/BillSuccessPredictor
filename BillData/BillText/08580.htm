SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF MEDICARE LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITAL WAIVER OF SITE-
              NEUTRAL IPPS PAYMENT RATE.

    (a) In General.--Section 3711 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww note) is amended--
            (1) in the section header, by striking ``during emergency 
        period''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(c) Twelve-Month Continued Application of Waiver of Site-Neutral 
IPPS Payment Rate.--With respect to inpatient hospital services 
furnished by a long-term care hospital described in section 
1886(d)(1)(B)(iv) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395ww(d)(1)(B)(iv)) during the 12-month period beginning on the last 
day of the emergency period described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of such 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(g)(1)(B)), the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services shall continue to waive subparagraph (A)(i) of section 
1886(m)(6) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(m)(6)), relating to the 
application of the site-neutral payment rate (and payment shall be made 
to a long-term care hospital without regard to such section) for a 
discharge, if the admission occurs during such 12-month period.''.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
submit to Congress a report on the impact of the waiver of section 
1886(m)(6)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395ww(m)(6)(A)(i)), relating to the application of the site-neutral 
payment rate, during the emergency period described in section 
1135(g)(1)(B) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(g)(1)(B)) and the 12-month 
period following such period pursuant to section 3711(c) of the 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww 
note), as added by subsection (a). The report shall--
            (1) include--
                    (A) information on the access of Medicare 
                beneficiaries (including those enrolled under part C of 
                title XVIII of the Social Security Act) to long term 
                care hospitals;
                    (B) any noticeable trends in admissions to long 
                term care hospitals; and
                    (C) data related to the financial status and 
                facility closures of long term care hospitals during 
                the period of fiscal years 2017 through 2021; and
            (2) assess the role of post-acute care facilities, 
        including long-term care hospitals, in maintaining Medicare 
        beneficiary access to services during the COVID-19 pandemic and 
        estimate the effect that site-neutral payment policies may have 
        on beneficiary access during future pandemic responses.

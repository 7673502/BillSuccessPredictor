SEC. 3. STUDY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of 
Commerce, and the Secretary of Transportation shall jointly conduct and 
submit to Congress a report describing the results of a study--
            (1) to examine the potential for emissions reductions at 
        industrial facilities through hydrogen applications, 
        including--
                    (A) the potential use of levelized cost of carbon 
                abatement, or a similar metric, in analyzing industrial 
                uses of hydrogen; and
                    (B) the feasibility and impact of incorporating 
                levelized cost of carbon abatement to compare the costs 
                of technology options to reduce emissions across a 
                range of industrial applications;
            (2) to fully address existing challenges with respect to 
        ensuring the safe use and handling of hydrogen and hydrogen-
        based fuels in industrial systems, including health and 
        environmental impacts associated with the leakage of hydrogen 
        and hydrogen carriers;
            (3) to identify and evaluate the feasibility, safety, and 
        best practices of the use of hydrogen and ammonia as industrial 
        fuel and feedstock;
            (4) to examine the feasibility of blending increasing 
        levels of hydrogen with natural gas to supplement process heat 
        requirements;
            (5) to examine the environmental impacts of hydrogen 
        combustion in hydrogen-fueled gas turbines as pure hydrogen or 
        at different ratios if used in blended fuel; and
            (6) to identify and evaluate considerations for transport 
        and storage of hydrogen and hydrogen carriers, including--
                    (A) at industrial facilities;
                    (B) in salt caverns, hard rock caverns, and other 
                dedicated geological storage systems; and
                    (C) in pipelines.
    (b) Requirements.--In conducting the study under subsection (a), 
the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Commerce shall--
            (1) take into account lessons learned from demonstration 
        projects in other industries and projects in other countries; 
        and
            (2) evaluate the applicability of the lessons described in 
        paragraph (1) to the use of hydrogen in industrial 
        applications.

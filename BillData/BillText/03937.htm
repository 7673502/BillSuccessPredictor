ideas that promote race or sex stereotyping or scapegoating.
    (d) Race or Sex Stereotyping or Scapegoating Defined.--For the 
purposes of this Act, the term ``race or sex stereotyping or 
scapegoating'' consists of the following list of prohibited divisive

            (1) One race or sex is inherently superior to another race 
        or sex.
            (2) The United States is fundamentally racist or sexist.
            (3) An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is

        or unconsciously.
            (4) An individual should be discriminated against or 
        receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or 
        her race or sex.

        attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex.
            (6) An individual's moral character is necessarily 
        determined by his or her race or sex.
            (7) An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, 
        bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other 
        members of the same race or sex.
            (8) Any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, 
        or any other form of psychological distress on account of his 
        or her race or sex.
            (9) Meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are 
        racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to 
        oppress another.

SEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.

    If any provision of this Act, or the application of a provision of 
this Act to any person or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, 
the remainder of this Act, and the application of the provisions to any

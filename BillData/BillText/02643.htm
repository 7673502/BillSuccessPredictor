                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to 
   further develop, finalize, and implement updated regulations for 
  offshore oil and gas pipelines to address long-standing limitations 
 regarding its ability to ensure active pipeline integrity and address 
safety and environmental risks associated with decommissioning, and for 
                            other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Offshore Pipeline Safety Act''.

SEC. 2. FINALIZATION OF REGULATIONS RELATED TO OFFSHORE PIPELINES.

    Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the 
Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, shall issue final 
regulations relating to Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations in the Outer 
Continental Shelf--Pipelines and Pipeline Rights-of-Way (72 Fed. Reg. 
56,442 (Oct. 3, 2007)). Such regulations shall require owners of oil 
and gas pipelines subject to such regulations--
            (1) to provide for internal and external inspections of 
        pipelines by a third-party no less frequently than every two 
        years, unless the Director of the Bureau determines that any 
        such inspection is not required; and
            (2) to equip such pipelines with a leak detection system or 
        device that provides continuous volumetric comparison between 
        the pipeline's product input and output and includes alarms and 
        adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and 
        discharge volumes to enable any leaks from the pipeline to be 
        detected as quickly as possible.

SEC. 3. ADDRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS OF DECOMMISSIONING PIPELINES.

    (a) Study on Environmental Risks of Decommissioning Pipelines 
Versus Removing Pipelines.--
            (1) Study.--The Directors of the Bureau of Safety and 
        Environmental Enforcement and the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
        Management shall jointly conduct a study to evaluate the 
        environmental benefits and risks associated with 
        decommissioning oil and gas pipelines in place on the sea floor 
        compared to removing such pipelines. Such study shall include--
                    (A) an evaluation of pipelines that have been 
                decommissioned in place, identifying decommissioned 
                pipelines at high-risk of causing safety and 
                environmental harm, causing obstructions, or otherwise 
                unduly interfering with present or future uses of the 
                outer continental shelf; and
                    (B) recommendations on the best uses of the 
                revenues generated by the annual pipelines fees as 
                authorized by subsection (d).
            (2) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Directors shall transmit a report to 
        the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate, detailing the findings and 
        determinations of the study, including any recommendations for 
        legislation.
    (b) Required Considerations in Reviewing Decommissioning 
Applications.--In determining whether to permit an owner to 
decommission an oil or gas pipeline, the Bureau of Safety and 
Environmental Enforcement, shall fully consider whether the offshore 
oil and gas pipeline constitutes a hazard to navigation and commercial 
and recreational fishing operations, unduly interferes with other uses 
of the outer continental shelf, or has adverse environmental effects.
    (c) Ongoing Monitoring of Decommissioned Pipelines.--The Bureau of 
Safety and Environmental Enforcement shall continually monitor the 
condition and location of all oil and gas pipelines that have been 
decommissioned and remain in place, and shall maintain all relevant 
records of such monitoring.
    (d) Annual Pipeline Owners Fee.--Not later than 180 after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental 
Enforcement shall issue regulations to assess an annual fee on owners 
of offshore oil and gas pipelines for the purpose of providing the 
Bureau with funds to decommission or remove such pipelines in the event 
an owner files for bankruptcy. Such fee shall be no less than--
            (1) $10,000 per mile for such pipelines in water with a 
        depth of 500 feet or greater; and
            (2) $1,000 per mile for pipelines in water depth of under 
        500 feet.

SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT RELATING TO EXPOSED SEGMENTS OF OFFSHORE PIPELINES.

    If the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement identifies 
any exposed segment of any active or decommissioned pipeline, the 
Bureau shall either remove the pipeline from the ocean or ensure it is 
properly decommissioned and does not pose a threat. If a segment of any 
active pipeline is exposed or shifts, the Bureau shall re-secure such 
segment to the sea floor.

SEC. 5. COMPLETION OF STUDY RELATING TO ENVIRONMENT RISKS OF CHEMICAL 
              PRODUCTS USED IN OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS.

    (a) Completion of Study.--The Bureau of Safety and Environmental 
Enforcement shall complete a study addressing the risks to the 
environment of chemical products used in oil and gas operations 
including umbilical lines. In conducting the study, the Bureau shall 
seek input from chemical suppliers and the oil and gas industry.
    (b) Report.--Not later than two years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Bureau shall transmit a report of the findings and 
determinations in such study to Congress, including any recommendations 
for legislation.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    No provision of this Act shall take effect without considering 
whether such action will result in a reduction of reef fish habitat.

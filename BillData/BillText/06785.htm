                                 A BILL


 
  To assist in the conservation of the North Atlantic right whale by 
 supporting and providing financial resources for North Atlantic right 
  whale conservation programs and projects of persons with expertise 
 required for the conservation of North Atlantic right whales, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Right Whale Coexistence Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis) are 
        critically endangered, with fewer than 340 remaining at the 
        time of the introduction of this Act;
            (2) historically, the North Atlantic right whale population 
        was decimated by the whaling industry, although the whale 
        population received protections from such industry in the 
        1930s;
            (3) despite a modest recovery prior to 2010, the North 
        Atlantic right whale is one of the most endangered whales in 
        the world and has experienced a significant decline since 2010;
            (4) the North Atlantic right whale has been listed as an 
        endangered species under the Endangered Species Conservation 
        Act of 1969 (Public Law 89-669; 80 Stat. 926) and its successor 
        the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) 
        since 1970 and is designated as depleted under the Marine 
        Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq.);
            (5) because North Atlantic right whales are long-lived and 
        highly migratory, and at present rates females give birth to a 
        single calf only once every 5 to 10 years, they are highly 
        vulnerable to the impacts of human activity and habitat 
        degradation, with female whales and calves particularly 
        vulnerable to vessel strikes;
            (6) North Atlantic right whales frequently cross paths with 
        high vessel traffic areas and fishing grounds, leaving the 
        whales particularly vulnerable to vessel collisions and fishing 
        gear entanglements, the leading causes of injury and death to 
        the species;
            (7) even when North Atlantic right whales do not die as a 
        result of fishing gear entanglement or vessel strike, those 
        whales can still experience significant sub-lethal effects such 
        as chronic stress and reproductive failure;
            (8) this ongoing decline due to human impacts resulted in a 
        further 30 percent decline in the population between 2019 and 
        2020 resulting in the lowest population estimate in the past 2 
        decades;
            (9) based on the current rate of mortality of North 
        Atlantic right whales, and because of the small number of 
        breeding females in the population and low birth rates, recent 
        analysis suggests the species will lose its ability to recover 
        in merely a few decades if human-caused mortality is not 
        reduced immediately;
            (10) under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 
        U.S.C. 1361 et seq.), United States fishermen in certain 
        locations have been required to modify their fishing gear and 
        behavior to minimize the likelihood of entanglements, including 
        by using sinking groundlines, having weak links in buoy lines, 
        using multiple traps per buoy, appropriately marking fishing 
        gear, and complying with seasonal area-specific closures in 
        North Atlantic right whale habitats;
            (11) vessels in United States waters that are 65 feet or 
        more in length have been required to comply with a seasonal 10-
        knot speed limit in certain locations to reduce the threat of 
        vessel collisions; and
            (12) ongoing mortalities, driven in part by shifts in North 
        Atlantic right whale distribution caused by climate change, 
        indicate that additional actions are necessary to reverse this 
        species' population decline.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Governments of the United States and Canada must 
        work together to reduce lethal and sub-lethal effects of human 
        activities on North Atlantic right whales; and
            (2) effectively addressing the threats to the long-term 
        viability of the North Atlantic right whales will require a 
        joint commitment and effort from government entities, local 
        communities, marine scientists and conservationists, fishermen, 
        owners and operators of commercial and recreational vessels and 
        others in the boating and shipping industries, and other 
        stakeholders.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are the following:
            (1) To rebuild healthy populations of the North Atlantic 
        right whale.
            (2) To assist in the conservation and protection of North 
        Atlantic right whales by supporting North Atlantic right whale 
        conservation programs that minimize conflicts between North 
        Atlantic right whales and human activities.

                country described in subparagraph (A).
    (d) Criteria for Approval.--The Secretary may approve a project 
proposal under this section that is likely to aid in the recovery and 
sustainability of a viable population of North Atlantic right whales in 
the wild. Such projects shall--
            (1) address the unintentional conflicts between humans and 
        North Atlantic right whales through development, testing, and 
        use of innovative technology or other methods to reduce the 
        lethal and sub-lethal effects on North Atlantic right whales 
        from fishing gear entanglements and vessel collisions; and
            (2)(A) promote cooperative projects on such topics with 
        foreign governments; or
            (B) promote cooperative projects on such topics with 
        affected local communities, small businesses such as fishermen, 
        others in the maritime private sector, or nongovernmental 
        organizations.
    (e) Priority.--In determining whether to fund project proposals 
under this section, the Secretary shall prioritize projects--
            (1) with a substantial likelihood of reducing lethal and 
        sub-lethal effects on North Atlantic right whales from fishing 
        gear entanglements or vessel collisions;
            (2) that include cooperation with private sector 
        stakeholders; and

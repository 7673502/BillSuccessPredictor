            ``(1) Sponsor.--For purposes of this subsection, the term

                protection measures the cost of which may be incurred 
                by a sponsor prior to entering into an agreement with 
                the Secretary pursuant to this section; and
                    ``(B) develop a procedure, including appropriate 
                deadlines, to be implemented at the State level, 
                through which a sponsor may request, for a specified 
                natural disaster, additional emergency watershed 
                protection measures the cost of which may be incurred 
                by a sponsor prior to entering into an agreement with

            ``(3) Agreement contribution.--If the Secretary and the

        Secretary shall consider any applicable pre-agreement costs 
        incurred by a sponsor for undertaking emergency watershed 
        protection measures identified pursuant to paragraph (2) as 
        meeting part of the sponsor's contribution towards the project 
        costs.
            ``(4) Assumption of risk.--Nothing in this subsection 
        requires the Secretary to enter into an agreement with a 
        sponsor, and a sponsor undertaking emergency watershed 
        protection measures prior to entering into an agreement with 
        the Secretary pursuant to this section shall assume the risk of 
        incurring any costs of undertaking such measures.''.

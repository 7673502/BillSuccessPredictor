                    aliens, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Safety and Security Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. SUSPENSION OF ENTRY OF ALIENS.

    (a) Authority To Suspend Entry of Aliens at Borders of the United 
States.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Secretary 
of Homeland Security determines, in his discretion, that the suspension 
of the entry of covered aliens at an international land or maritime 
border of the United States is necessary in order to achieve 
operational control over such border, the Secretary may prohibit, in 
whole or in part, the entry of covered aliens at such border for such 
period of time as the Secretary determines is necessary for such 
purpose.
    (b) Required Suspension of Entry of Aliens.--Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
prohibit the entry of covered aliens for any period during which the 
Secretary cannot--
            (1) detain such covered aliens as required under section 
        235(b)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1225(b)(1)(B)); or
            (2) place such covered aliens in a program consistent with 
        section 235(b)(2)(C) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
        U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)).
    (c) Enforcement by State Attorneys General.--The attorney general 
of a State, or other authorized State officer, alleging a violation of 
a subsection (b) that affects such State or its residents, may bring an 
action against the Secretary of Homeland Security on behalf of the 
residents of the State in an appropriate United States district court 
to obtain appropriate injunctive relief.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Except as otherwise provided, the terms have the 
        meanings given such terms in section 101 of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101).
            (2) The term ``covered alien'' means an alien seeking entry 
        to the United States who is inadmissible under section 
        212(a)(7) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
        1182(a)(7)).
            (3) The term ``operational control'' has the meaning given 
        such term in section 2 of the Secure the Fence Act of 2006 (8 
        U.S.C. 1701 note).

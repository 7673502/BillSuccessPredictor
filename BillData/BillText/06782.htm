                                    ``(I) who is eligible to 
                                participate in the arrangement, and
                                    ``(II) who, at the time of the

                                affirmative election pursuant to clause 
                                (ii) not to have contributions 
                                described in clause (i) made,

                        (ii). Such determination may be made at one 
                        time for all employees described in the

            (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the National Quantum Initiative Act to make certain additions 
  relating to quantum modeling and simulation, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum in Practice Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Quantum computing has the potential to spur 
        advancements in molecular modeling and simulation that will 
        benefit Americans.
            (2) Quantum molecular simulations and modeling will enable 
        scientists to study chemical elements and reactions with 
        accuracy and speed that is far beyond the abilities of existing 
        supercomputers.
            (3) Advances in molecular simulations and modeling would 
        give researchers tools that could lead to breakthroughs across 
        industries and sectors, including--
                    (A) modeling the nitrogen fixation process utilized 
                by bacteria, which could be used to develop synthetic 
                fertilizers without the high energy and material costs 
                of current methods, creating the next generation of 
                fertilizers;
                    (B) creating more effective medications and 
                reducing harmful interactions or side effects;
                    (C) developing new materials to increase energy 
                storage capacity and create more powerful battery 
                technologies;
                    (D) developing lighter, stronger metals;
                    (E) creating materials for more durable protective 
                gear for law enforcement and military; and
                    (F) developing new types of superconductors.

SEC. 3. QUANTUM MODELING AND SIMULATION.

    (a) Definition of Quantum Information Science.--Section 2(6) of the 
National Quantum Initiative Act (15 U.S.C. 8801(6)) is amended by 
inserting ``modeling, simulation,'' after ``computing''.
    (b) Quantum Information Science Research Program.--Section 
401(b)(3) of such Act (15 U.S.C. 8851(b)(3)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (F), by striking ``and'';
            (2) in subparagraph (G), by inserting ``and'' at the end; 
        and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(H) quantum molecular modeling or simulation;''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

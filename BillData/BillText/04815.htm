              EDUCATION.

    ``(a) Eligibility.--An institution of higher education that 
receives Federal funds or financial assistance under any Federal 
program shall not prohibit a Dreamer student from applying for 
admission, nor shall it prohibit a Dreamer student who is accepted to 
that institution from enrolling.
    ``(b) Admissions.--An institution of higher education that receives 
Federal funds or financial assistance under any Federal program shall 
not discriminate against or penalize in the admissions process a 
Dreamer student who is otherwise qualified for admission to the 
institution, on the basis of that individual's immigration status, nor 
shall such an institution differentiate in the admissions process on 
the basis of residency between a United States citizen applicant and a 
Dreamer student applying from the same State.
    ``(c) Tuition Rate.--An institution of higher education that 
receives Federal funds or financial assistance under any Federal 
program shall not charge a greater rate of tuition than the rate 
charged for residents of the State in which the institution is located 
to a Dreamer student who, but for such individual's immigration status, 
otherwise qualifies as a resident of the State in which the institution 
is located.
    ``(d) Remedies.--An institution of higher education that violates 
subsection (a), (b), or (c) shall be subject to the remedies described 
in sections 454 and 455 of the General Education Provisions Act (8

        States, of a State, or of an institution of higher education 
        that receives Federal funds or financial assistance under any 
        Federal program to which a Dreamer student applies for 
        admission or enrolls, may--
                    ``(A) use the information furnished by the Dreamer 
                student to arrest, detain, or initiate removal 
                proceedings against any person identified in that 
                information;
                    ``(B) make any publication whereby the information 
                furnished by any particular Dreamer student can be 
                identified; or
                    ``(C) permit anyone other than an officer or 
                employee of the Federal Government or the institution 
                of higher education to which a Dreamer student applies 
                or enrolls, to examine any information provided by a 
                Dreamer student relating to that individual's 
                immigration status or qualifications to be a Dreamer 
                student.
            ``(2) Penalty.--Whoever knowingly uses, publishes, or

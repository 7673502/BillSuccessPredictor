                                 A BILL


 
To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to 
    establish a pilot program for hyperlocal air quality monitoring 
 projects in environmental justice communities, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Environmental Justice Air Quality 
Monitoring Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) air pollution inflicts disproportionate harm on Black 
        people, Indigenous people, and people of color;
            (2) air quality can vary up to 800 percent from block to 
        block within a single neighborhood;
            (3) it is possible to identify and attribute sources of 
        pollution based on fingerprint analysis of multiple pollutants;
            (4) existing methods that are prescribed for basin-wide air 
        quality monitoring--
                    (A) are cost-prohibitive for monitoring community-
                scale air quality; and
                    (B) do not, as of the date of enactment of this 
                Act, measure the intrinsic variability of persistently 
                poor air quality in environmental justice communities 
                at the neighborhood block level; and
            (5) the Environmental Protection Agency has existing 
        authority under the Clean Air Act to address air pollutants, 
        including greenhouse gases.

SEC. 4. PILOT PROGRAM FOR HYPERLOCAL AIR QUALITY MONITORING PROJECTS IN 
              ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES.

    (a) Establishment.--Subject to the availability of appropriations, 
the Administrator shall carry out a pilot program to award, on a 
competitive basis, grants or contracts to State, local, and Tribal air 
agencies, in partnership with local nonprofit organizations or eligible 
hyperlocal air quality data providers, to carry out projects described 
in subsection (b) for hyperlocal air quality monitoring systems in 
environmental justice communities.
    (b) Projects.--A State, local, or Tribal air agency that receives a 
grant or contract under the pilot program shall use amounts received 
under the grant or contract to carry out an air quality monitoring 
project within a geographical region specified by the State, local, or 
Tribal air agency--
            (1) to monitor air quality at a level of discreteness 
        capable of monitoring an area that is the smaller of--
                    (A) a block; and
                    (B) a 100-meter radius;
            (2) to identify areas of persistent elevated air pollution 
        levels above a relevant background level;
            (3) to regularly monitor air quality using monitoring 
        technology that meets the data quality objectives of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency, which may, in the 
        determination of the Administrator, include a requirement that 
        the technology qualify as a Federal Reference Method or a 
        Federal Equivalent Method;
            (4) to determine changes in ambient levels of relevant air 
        pollutants;
            (5) to generate equity maps by geographical area, including 
        generating maps using such variables as demographic data 
        relating to race, ethnicity, and income level; and
            (6) to report hyperlocal air quality data and mapping tools 
        to--
                    (A) community residents through an online platform 
                to increase public awareness and engagement; and
                    (B) relevant local, State, Tribal, and Federal air 
                pollution managers to inform management decisions, such 
                as the placement or relocation of stationary air 
                pollution monitors, transportation or land use 
                planning, investments in mitigating air pollution 
                sources, and other planning decisions.
    (c) Project Selection.--
            (1) Applications.--A State, local, or Tribal air agency 
        seeking a grant or contract under the pilot program shall 
        submit to the Administrator an application at such time, in 
        such manner, and containing such information as the 
        Administrator may require.
            (2) Prioritization.--In selecting projects to receive 
        grants or contracts under the pilot program, the Administrator 
        shall give priority to projects that--
                    (A) would be carried out in areas with high rates 
                of illness associated with exposure to air pollution, 
                as determined by the Administrator, including childhood 
                asthma, adult asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
                disease, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, and cancer;
                    (B) seek to identify pollution sources through 
                multipollutant analysis when relevant;
                    (C) would be able to assess pollution burdens on 
                sensitive individuals who may be at greater risk of 
                adverse health effects from exposure to the air 
                pollutants to be monitored as compared to the general 
                population; and
                    (D) would promote--
                            (i) public access and transparency of data; 
                        and
                            (ii) proactive outreach for community 
                        engagement and awareness.
            (3) Equitable funding distribution.--A State, local, or 
        Tribal air agency that receives a grant or contract under the 
        pilot program shall ensure that air quality monitoring projects 
        deployed using amounts from the grant or contract--
                    (A) provide full-time, salaried employment 
                opportunities, with benefits, to local residents of 
                environmental justice communities, which may include 
                employment or training for positions such as--
                            (i) air quality monitoring device 
                        installation, maintenance, and calibration 
                        technicians;

                received from the grant or contract toward the 
                employment opportunities described in subparagraph (A).
    (d) Wage Rate Requirement.--Not withstanding any other provision of 
law, all laborers employed under projects funded directly by a grant or 
contract provided to a State, local, or Tribal air agency under the 
pilot program shall be paid wages at rates not less than those 
prevailing on projects of a similar character in the locality, as 
determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with subchapter IV 
of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code (commonly referred to as 
the ``Davis-Bacon Act'').
    (e) Duration.--A project carried out using a grant or contract 
awarded under the pilot program may not exceed 5 years in duration.
    (f) Evaluation Metrics.--To evaluate the effectiveness of the pilot 
program, the Administrator shall establish, based on the project

        fiscal year, which shall include, with respect to the fiscal 
        year covered by the report--

                program; and
                    (D) whether the Administrator proposes to continue 
                air quality monitoring at the locations monitored by 
                projects for which those grants or contracts were 
                awarded.
            (2) Final report.--Not later than 180 days after the date

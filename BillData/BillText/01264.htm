promulgate regulations providing additional indicators beyond the 
pertinent facts described in section 110.20(a)(5) of title 11, Code of 
Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) 
that may lead a reasonable person to conclude that there is a 
substantial probability that the source of the funds solicited, 
accepted, or received is a foreign national, as defined in section 
319(c) of the Federal Election Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30121(c)), as 
redesignated by subsection (a)(1), or to inquire whether the source of 
the funds solicited, accepted, or received is a foreign national, as so 
defined. Regulations promulgated under the proceeding sentence shall 
also provide guidance to political committees and campaigns to not 
engage in racial or ethnic profiling in making such a conclusion or 
inquiry.

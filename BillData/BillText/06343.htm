Combating Russian Money Laundering Act (Public Law 116-283) is

            (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:
    ``(b) Classified Information.--In any judicial review of a finding 
of the existence of a primary money laundering concern, or of the 
requirement for 1 or more special measures with respect to a primary

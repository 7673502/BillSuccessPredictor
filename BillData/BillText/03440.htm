SEC. 2. SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL CREDIT.

    (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after 
section 40A the following new section:

``SEC. 40B. SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL CREDIT.

    ``(a) In General.--
            ``(1) Credit amount.--For purposes of section 38, the 
        sustainable aviation fuel credit for the taxable year is, with 
        respect to each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel which is 
        used by the taxpayer in the production of a qualified mixture--
                    ``(A) a base credit amount of $1.50, plus
                    ``(B) the applicable supplementary credit amount.

                every percentage point above 50 percent for which the 
                sustainable aviation fuel is certified under subsection 
                (f) to reduce emissions in comparison with petroleum-
                based jet fuel as described in subsections (d)(2)(A) or

    ``(b) Qualified Mixture.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`qualified mixture' means a mixture of sustainable aviation fuel and 
kerosene, which--
            ``(1) is sold by the taxpayer producing such mixture for 
        use in an aircraft that has fuel uplift in the United States, 
        or

                United States.
    ``(c) Sale or Use Must Be in Trade or Business, etc.--Sustainable 
aviation fuel used in the production of a qualified mixture shall be 
taken into account--
            ``(1) only if the sale or use described in subsection (b)

        from a sustainability certification scheme approved by the 
        International Civil Aviation Organization demonstrating that 
        the fuel conforms with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction 
        Scheme for International Aviation's sustainability criteria and 
        the traceability and information transmission requirements 
        approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization with

To withdraw certain Federal land in the San Bernardino National Forest 
 in California from location, entry, and patent under mining laws, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Forest Service has implemented a strategy known as 
        the Carbonate Habitat Management Strategy to conserve listed 
        threatened and endangered species where minerals co-occur with 
        those species' habitats to allow for species conservation and 
        efficient administration of mining activities on the San 
        Bernardino National Forest.
            (2) The withdrawal of certain land in the San Bernardino 
        National Forest will create a reserve for designated crucial 
        habitat to protect four listed threatened and endangered plant 
        species from the effects of mining.

SEC. 2. WITHDRAWAL OF SAN BERNARDINO NATIONAL FOREST LAND FROM MINING 
              LAWS.

    Subject to valid existing rights, the approximately 3,055 acres of 
land generally depicted as ``Proposed Withdrawal'' on the map titled 
``Proposed Withdrawal-San Bernardino National Forest-Mountaintop Ranger 
District'', and dated October 19, 2020, is hereby withdrawn from--
            (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, and disposal under 
        the public land laws;
            (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and
            (3) operation of the mineral leasing, mineral materials, 
        and geothermal leasing laws.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

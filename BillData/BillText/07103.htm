        allowed to the taxpayer (or, except as otherwise provided by 
        the Secretary, any dependent of the taxpayer) under subsection 
        (f) for such taxable year. Any failure to so reduce the credit 
        shall be treated as arising out of a mathematical or clerical 
        error and assessed according to section 6213(b)(1).

                advance refund amount for any rebate taxable year is 
                the amount that would allowed as a credit under this 
                section for the applicable taxable year if this section

                to any effective date) using the gasoline price rebate 
                amount for the refund taxable year.
                    (B) Treatment of deceased individuals.--For

                        be treated for purposes of applying subsection 
                        (d)(2) in the same manner as if the valid 
                        identification number of such person was not 
                        included on the return of tax for the 
                        applicable taxable year (except that 
                        subparagraph (D) thereof shall not apply), and
                            (ii) notwithstanding clause (i), in the 
                        case of a joint return with respect to which

                determination.--If, at the time of any determination 
                made pursuant to paragraph (3), the individual referred

                individual's first taxable year beginning after the 
                applicable taxable year, paragraph (1) shall be applied 
                with respect to such individual by substituting

                        individual who files, before the additional 
                        payment determination date, a return of tax for 
                        such individual's first taxable year beginning

        rules similar to the rules of section 6428A(f)(5)(H)(i), apply

        Secretary and shall, on the basis of such information, 
        determine the advance refund amount with respect to such

        such payment) if such information is not otherwise available to 
        the Secretary, and
            (2) regulations or other guidance to ensure to the maximum 
        extent administratively practicable that, in determining the

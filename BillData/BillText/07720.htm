                State, for the relocation of the headquarters using a 
                competitive bidding procedure that considers--
                            (i) the extent to which the relocation of

                        subdivision of a State;
                            (ii) whether a State, or a political 
                        subdivision of a State, has expertise in 
                        carrying out activities substantially similar 
                        to the mission and goals of the Executive 
                        agency; and

                        the headquarters to a State, or a political 
                        subdivision of a State, would implicate 
                        national security interests.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
to prohibit a political subdivision of the State of Maryland or the

metropolitan area from submitting a proposal under subsection 
(c)(2)(A).

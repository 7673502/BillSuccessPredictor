    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Computing Advancements for Materials 
Science Act'' or the ``CAMS Act''.

SEC. 2. COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS AND CHEMISTRY.

    (a) In General.--Section 303 of the Department of Energy Research 
and Innovation Act (42 U.S.C. 18641) is amended by--
            (1) redesignating subsections (d) and (e) as subsections 
        (e) and (f), respectively; and
            (2) inserting after subsection (c) the following:
    ``(d) Computational Materials and Chemistry.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Director shall support a program of 
        fundamental research for the application of advanced computing 
        practices to foundational and emerging research problems in 
        chemistry and materials science.
            ``(2) Computational materials and chemistry science 
        centers.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In carrying out the activities 
                authorized under paragraph (1), the Director shall 
                select and establish up to four computational materials 
                and chemistry science centers to develop open-source, 
                robust, and validated computational codes and user-
                friendly software, coupled with innovative use of 
                experimental and theoretical data, to enable the 
                design, discovery, and development of new materials and 
                chemical systems including chemical catalysis research 
                and development. These centers shall also focus on 
                overcoming challenges and maximizing the benefits of 
                exascale and other high performance computing systems.
                    ``(B) Selection.--The Director shall select centers 
                under paragraph (1) on a competitive, merit-reviewed 
                basis. The Director shall consider applications from 
                the National Laboratories, institutes of higher 
                education, multi-institutional collaborations, and 
                other appropriate entities.
                    ``(C) Duration.--A center established under this 
                subsection shall receive support for a period of not 
                more than 5 years, subject to the availability of 
                appropriations.
                    ``(D) Renewal.--Upon the expiration of any period 
                of support of a center under this paragraph, the 
                Director may renew support for the center, on a merit-
                reviewed basis, for a period of not more than 5 years.
                    ``(E) Termination.--Consistent with the existing 
                authorities of the Department, the Director may 
                terminate an underperforming center for cause during 
                the performance period.
            ``(3) Materials research database.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Director shall support the 
                development of a web-based platform to provide access 
                to a database of computed information on known and 
                predicted materials properties and computational tools 
                to accelerate breakthroughs in materials discovery and 
                design.
                    ``(B) Program.--In carrying out this paragraph, the 
                Director shall--
                            ``(i) conduct cooperative research with 
                        industry, academia, and other research 
                        institutions to facilitate the design of novel 
                        materials;
                            ``(ii) leverage existing high performance 
                        computing systems to conduct high-throughput 
                        calculations, and develop computational and 
                        data mining algorithms for the prediction of 
                        material properties;
                            ``(iii) advance understanding, prediction, 
                        and manipulation of materials;
                            ``(iv) strengthen the foundation for new 
                        technologies and advanced manufacturing; and
                            ``(v) drive the development of advanced 
                        materials for applications that span the 
                        Department's missions in energy, environment,

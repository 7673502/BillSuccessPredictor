                    ``(A) In general.--It shall not be a violation of 
                the prohibition in paragraph (1)(A) for a person, using 
                an automatic telephone dialing system or an artificial 
                or prerecorded voice, to make a call or send a text 
                message to a telephone number without the prior express 
                consent of the subscriber assigned such telephone 
                number if such person obtained express consent to make 
                such call or send such text message to such number from 
                a subscriber assigned such number on the date on which 
                such express consent was obtained.
                    ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply 
                unless the person making such call or sending such 
                text, bearing the burden of proof, demonstrates that--
                            ``(i) prior to making such call, such 
                        person queried the database maintained by the 
                        Commission under subparagraph (C) to determine 
                        whether such number was permanently 
                        disconnected after the date on which prior 
                        express consent was obtained from a subscriber 
                        previously assigned such number, and received a 
                        response indicating such number was not 
                        permanently disconnected after such date; and
                            ``(ii) if such person had not received such 
                        response, such person would not have made such 
                        call or sent such text message to such number.
                    ``(C) Reassigned telephone number database.--The 
                Commission shall maintain a database which persons may 
                query for the purpose of determining whether a 
                telephone number was permanently disconnected after the 
                date on which prior express consent was obtained from a 
                subscriber assigned such number.''.
    (b) Rulemaking.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission, with 
consideration given to modern dialing practices and consumer 
preferences, shall issue a rule defining the terms ``automatically'', 
``dial'', ``send'', and ``charged for the call'', as used in 227(a)(1) 
of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 227(a)(1)), as amended by 
this Act.

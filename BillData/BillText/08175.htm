    In this Act, the term ``counterfeit fentanyl or methamphetamine 
substance'' means a substance that--
            (1) contains fentanyl, any analogue of fentanyl, or 
        methamphetamine; and
            (2) is marketed, sold, or falsely bears the trademark,

SEC. 4. DIRECTIVE TO THE UNITED STATES SENTENCING COMMISSION.

    The United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend, if 
appropriate, the sentencing guidelines in accordance with section 994 
of title 28, United States Code, to provide for a 4-level enhancement

or over-the-counter medication in pill or tablet form a counterfeit or 
otherwise adulterated pill or tablet that contained a detectable amount 
of fentanyl, or a fentanyl analogue, or methamphetamine.

SEC. 5. COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, 
the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration shall 
establish and implement an operation and response plan to address

                effective in increasing education and prevention; and
                    (B) how the efforts described in subparagraph (A) 
                are tailored to youth and teen access; and
            (3) an audit of current campaigns, including the ``One Pill 
        Can Kill'' campaign, on counterfeit fentanyl or methamphetamine 
        substances, including a review of data and other available 
        information on how such campaigns can be tailored, adjusted, or 
        improved to better address the flow of counterfeit fentanyl or 
        methamphetamine substances.

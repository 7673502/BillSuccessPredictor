(c).
    (b) Uses.--Amounts in the Fund--
            (1) shall be available to the Secretary of State only for 
        the purposes described in paragraph (2), without fiscal year 
        limitation or need for subsequent appropriation;
            (2) shall be used only for the purposes of--
                    (A) strengthening democratic governance and 
                institutions, including the democratically elected 
                National Assembly of Venezuela;
                    (B) defending internationally recognized human 
                rights for the people of Venezuela, including support

                violations of human rights;
                    (C) supporting the efforts of independent media 
                outlets to broadcast, distribute, and share information

                Maduro regime; and
                    (D) combatting corruption and improving the

                are part of the Maduro regime;
            (3) may support governmental and nongovernmental parties in 
        advancing the purposes described in paragraph (2); and

        existing United States foreign assistance, diplomacy, and anti-
        corruption activities.
    (c) Funding.--Beginning on or after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of 
any funds or assets forfeited to the United States by an individual or 
entity connected to the regimes of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro in 
Venezuela, the funds or assets will be deposited in the Venezuela 
Restoration Fund established under subsection (a).
    (d) Report on Deposit of Funds.--Not later than 90 days after the 
date of the enactment of this Act and every 90 days thereafter, the 
Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a report that includes an accounting of the amount and 
sources of funds that have been deposited into the Venezuela 
Restoration Fund established under subsection (a) during the preceding 
90-day period.
    (e) Notification on Expenditure of Funds.--Upon expenditure of 
funds from the Venezuela Restoration Fund established under subsection 
(a), the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a summary of the obligation, amounts, and

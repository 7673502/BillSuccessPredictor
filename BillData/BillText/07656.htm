                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 
 2003 to strike the Secretary's unilateral authority during a national 
                   emergency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Reckless Student Loan Actions 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students 
        Act of 2003 (20 U.S.C. 1098aa et seq.) was intended to provide 
        relief opportunities for members of the armed services.
            (2) The authority provided under the Higher Education 
        Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 has been abused 
        by the Executive Branch during the COVID-19 national emergency 
        regarding the payment of Federal student loans.
            (3) The unilateral payment pause on Federal student loans 
        has cost $100,000,000,000.
            (4) The individuals benefiting the most from the payment 
        pause continued by the Executive Branch are doctors, who 
        receive 11 times the benefit of bachelor's degree recipients 
        and 14 times the benefit of associate's degree recipients.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE HIGHER EDUCATION RELIEF OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
              STUDENTS ACT OF 2003.

Students Act of 2003 (20 U.S.C. 1098ee) is amended--
            (1) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by inserting 
        ``(or the spouse or dependent of the parent, as that term is

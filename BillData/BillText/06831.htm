                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to issue regulations for 
    amphibious passenger vessels operating in waters subject to the 
       jurisdiction of the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REQUIREMENTS FOR AMPHIBIOUS PASSENGER VESSELS.

    (a) Regulations Required.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Commandant of the Coast Guard shall 
issue regulations for amphibious passenger vessels operating in waters 
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, as defined in section 
2.38 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date 
of enactment of this Act).
    (b) Deadline for Compliance.--The regulations issued under 
subsection (a) shall take effect not later than 24 months after the 
date of the enactment of this Act.
    (c) Requirements.--The regulations required under subsection (a) 
shall include the following:
            (1) A requirement that operators of amphibious passenger 
        vessels provide reserve buoyancy for such vessels through 
        passive means, including watertight compartmentalization, 
        built-in flotation, or such other means as determined 
        appropriate by the Commandant, in order to ensure that such 
        vessels remain afloat and upright in the event of flooding, 
        including when carrying a full complement of passengers and 
        crew.
            (2) A requirement that an operator of an amphibious 
        passenger vessel--
                    (A) review and notate the forecast of the National 
                Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
                Administration in the logbook of the vessel before 
                getting underway and periodically while underway;
                    (B) proceed to the nearest harbor or safe refuge in 
                any case in which a watch or warning is issued for wind 
                speeds exceeding the wind speed equivalent used to 
                certify the stability of such amphibious passenger 
                vessel; and
                    (C) maintain and monitor a weather monitor radio 
                receiver at the operator station of the vessel that is 
                capable of being automatically activated by the warning 
                alarm device of the National Weather Service.
            (3) A requirement that--
                    (A) operators of amphibious passenger vessels 
                inform passengers that seat belts may not be worn 
                during waterborne operations;
                    (B) before the commencement of waterborne 
                operations, a crew member shall visually check that the 
                seatbelt of each passenger is unbuckled; and
                    (C) operators or crew maintain a log recording the 
                actions described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).
            (4) A requirement for annual training for operators and 
        crew of amphibious passengers vessels, including--
                    (A) training for personal flotation and seat belt 
                requirements, verifying the integrity of the vessel at 
                the onset of each waterborne departure, identification 
                of weather hazards, and use of National Weather Service 
                resources prior to operation; and
                    (B) training for crew to respond to emergency 
                situations, including flooding, engine compartment 
                fires, man-overboard situations, and in water emergency 
                egress procedures.
    (d) Consideration.--In issuing the regulations required under 
subsection (a), the Commandant shall consider whether personal 
flotation devices should be required for the duration of the waterborne 
transit of an amphibious passenger vessel.
    (e) Interim Requirements.--Beginning on the date on which the 
regulations under subsection (a) are issued, the Commandant shall 
require that operators of amphibious passenger vessels that are not in 
compliance with such regulations shall be subject to the following 
requirements:
            (1) Remove the canopies and any window coverings of such 
        vessels for waterborne operations, or install in such vessels a 
        canopy that does not restrict horizontal or vertical escape by 
        passengers in the event of flooding or sinking.
            (2) If a canopy and window covering are removed from any 
        such vessel pursuant to paragraph (1), require that all 
        passengers wear a personal flotation device approved by the 
        Coast Guard before the onset of waterborne operations of such 
        vessel.
            (3) Reengineer such vessels to permanently close all 
        unnecessary access plugs and reduce all through-hull 
        penetrations to the minimum number and size necessary for 
        operation.
            (4) Install in such vessels independently powered electric 
        bilge pumps that are capable of dewatering such vessels at the 
        volume of the largest remaining penetration in order to 
        supplement an operable Higgins pump or a dewatering pump of 
        equivalent or greater capacity.
            (5) Install in such vessels not fewer than 4 independently 
        powered bilge alarms.
            (6) Conduct an in-water inspection of any such vessel after 
        each time a through-hull penetration of such vessel has been 
        removed or uncovered.
            (7) Verify through an in-water inspection the watertight 
        integrity of any such vessel at the outset of each waterborne 
        departure of such vessel.
            (8) Install underwater LED lights that activate 
        automatically in an emergency.
            (9) Otherwise comply with any other provisions of the 
        circular titled ``Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular 1-
        01'' in the inspection, configuration, and operation of such 
        vessels.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

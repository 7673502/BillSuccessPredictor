SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since 1949, the close relationship between the United 
        States and Taiwan has been of enormous benefit to both parties 
        and to the Indo-Pacific region as a whole.
            (2) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 U.S.C. 
        3301 et seq.) has enabled the people of the United States and 
        the people of Taiwan to maintain a strong and important 
        relationship that promotes regional security, prosperity, and 
        shared democratic values.
            (3) The security of Taiwan and the ability for the people 
        of Taiwan to determine their own future is fundamental to 
        United States interests and values.
            (4) The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office 
        in the United States and the American Institute in Taiwan 
        facilitate critical consular relations that--
                    (A) protect the interests of the people of the 
                United States and the people of Taiwan; and
                    (B) strengthen people-to-people ties.
            (5) Increased engagement between public officials, 
        commercial interests, civil society leaders, and others 
        enhances United States-Taiwan relations and its economic, 
        security, and democratic dimensions.
            (6) Taiwan serves as a critical partner on regional and 
        transnational issues, such as public health, climate change, 
        critical and emerging technologies, cybersecurity, trade, and 
        freedom of navigation.
            (7) Taiwan exemplifies a thriving democracy consisting of 
        more than 23,000,000 people who value their suffrage, free 
        markets, right to due process, freedom of expression, and other 
        individual liberties.
            (8) President Xi Jinping of the People's Republic of China 
        (referred to in this Act as the ``PRC'') continues to repeat 
        his desire to stifle the freedom of Taiwan, as evidenced by his 
        July 2021 proclamation, in which he stated, ``All sons and 
        daughters of China, including compatriots on both sides of the 
        Taiwan Strait, must work together and move forward in 
        solidarity, resolutely smashing any Taiwan independence 
        plots.''.
            (9) As President Xi Jinping consolidates his power in the 
        Chinese Communist Party (referred to in this Act as the 
        ``CCP''), he is escalating the PRC's campaign of coercion and 
        intimidation against Taiwan, as evidenced by--
                    (A) the accelerated preparations made by the PRC 
                and its People's Liberation Army (referred to in this 
                Act as the ``PLA'') for an offensive attack against 
                Taiwan, such as the PLA's January 2022 incursion of 
                nearly 40 fighters, bombers, and other warplanes into 
                Taiwan's air defense identification zone;
                    (B) the PLA's growing offensive preparations in the 
                Taiwan Strait, such as amphibious assault and live-fire 
                exercises and record-scale incursions into Taiwanese 
                air space;
                    (C) the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic efforts to 
                isolate Taiwan, such as abusing its position in 
                international institutions and multilateral fora to 
                exclude Taiwanese participation despite Taiwan's 
                demonstrated expertise in relevant subjects, such as 
                public health;
                    (D) threats and actions to compromise Taiwan's 
                economy and critical suppliers, such as draconian 
                export controls and the ``31 Measures'' intended to 
                lure Taiwanese talent to mainland China and away from 
                Taiwan;
                    (E) persistent and targeted cyberattacks, numbering 
                nearly 20,000,000 per month, which are intended to 
                compromise Taiwan's critical infrastructure and inflict 
                civilian harm;
                    (F) political and economic pressure on other 
                countries who seek closer ties with Taiwan, such as 
                recent export controls related to Lithuania after 
                Lithuania announced a permanent Taiwanese 
                Representative Office in Lithuania.
            (10) On multiple occasions, through both formal and 
        informal channels, the United States has expressed its concern 
        for the PRC's destabilizing activities in the Taiwan Strait and 
        on the international stage that aim to subvert Taiwan's 
        democratic institutions.
            (11) The Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States--
                    (A) identifies Taiwan as an important leading 
                regional partner;
                    (B) seeks to bolster Taiwan's self-defense 
                capabilities; and
                    (C) reaffirms that Taiwan's future must be 
                determined peacefully and in accordance with the wishes 
                and best interests of the people of Taiwan.
            (12) The PRC considers stifling the freedom of Taiwan as a 
        critical and necessary step to displacing the United States as 
        the preeminent military power in the Indo-Pacific and continues 
        its modernization campaign to enhance the power-projection 
        capabilities of the PLA and its ability to conduct joint 
        operations.
            (13) Taiwan maintains a modern, ready, self-defense force 
        that adheres to the highest democratic principles and benefits 
        from continued state-of-the-art security assistance.
            (14) It is a vital national security interest of the United 
        States to defend Taiwan for the purposes of--
                    (A) mitigating the PLA's ability to project power 
                and establish contested zones within the First and 
                Second Island Chains and limiting the PLA's freedom of 
                maneuver to conduct unconstrained power projection 
                capabilities beyond the First Island Chain in order to 
                protect United States territory, such as Hawaii and 
                Guam;
                    (B) defending the territorial integrity of Indo-
                Pacific allies, such as Japan;
                    (C) deterring other countries and competitors from 
                exercising force as a means to revise the established 
                status quo;
                    (D) championing democratic institutions and 
                societies in the Indo-Pacific region and throughout the 
                world; and
                    (E) maintaining a rules-based international order 
                that--
                            (i) constrains authoritarian powers;
                            (ii) enshrines collective security;
                            (iii) promotes democracy and respect for 
                        human rights and fundamental freedoms; and
                            (iv) promotes peace and prosperity.

SEC. 101. DECLARATION OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to support the security of Taiwan, the stability of

        United States in promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific;
            (3) to deter the use of force by the PRC to change the 
        status quo of Taiwan by coordinating with allies and partners 
        to identify and develop significant economic, diplomatic, and 
        other measures that will deter and impose costs on any such use 
        of force and support and cooperate with Taiwan to implement, 
        resource, and modernize its military capabilities, including an 
        effective defense strategy, through security assistance and 
        increases in defense spending;
            (4) to strengthen cooperation with the military of Taiwan 
        under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-
        8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the Six Assurances, with 
        consideration of the ongoing military buildup in China and the 
        military balance in the Taiwan Strait, and to transfer defense 
        articles to Taiwan to enhance its capabilities, including its 
        efforts to undertake defensive operations and maintain the 
        ability to deny PRC coercion and invasion;
            (5) to urge Taiwan to increase its own investments in 
        military capabilities, including those that support the 
        implementation of an effective defense strategy;
            (6) to advance and finalize key provisions of the United 
        States-Taiwan Trade and Investment Framework Agreement and

        advance the interests of the United States by negotiating a 
        bilateral free trade agreement as soon as possible, which will 
        include appropriate levels of labor rights and environmental 
        protections;

            (9) to support the Government of Taiwan as a representative 
        democratic government, constituted through free and fair 
        elections that reflect the will of the people of Taiwan and 
        promote dignity and respect for the democratically elected

        Taiwan as the legitimate representative of the people of

    (b) No Restrictions on Bilateral Interactions.--Notwithstanding the 
continued supporting role of the American Institute in Taiwan in

                any related organizations; and
                    ``(C) did not take a position on the relationship 
                between the People's Republic of China and Taiwan or 
                include any statement pertaining to Taiwan's 
                sovereignty.
            ``(11) The United States opposes any initiative that seeks 
        to change Taiwan's status without the consent of the people of 
        Taiwan.''.

SEC. 403. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT 
              BANK.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States fully supports Taiwan's participation 
        in, and contribution to, international organizations and 
        underscores the importance of the relationship between Taiwan 
        and the United States;
            (2) diversifying the donor base of the Inter-American 
        Development Bank (referred to in this title as the ``IDB'') and 
        increasing allied engagement in the Western Hemisphere 
        reinforces United States national interests;
            (3) Taiwan's significant contribution to the development 
        and economies of Latin America and the Caribbean demonstrate 
        that Taiwan's membership in the IDB as a non-borrowing member 
        would benefit the IDB and the entire Latin American and 
        Caribbean region; and
            (4) non-borrowing membership in the IDB would allow Taiwan 
        to substantially leverage and channel the immense resources 
        Taiwan already provides to Latin America and the Caribbean to 
        reach a larger number of beneficiaries.

Treasury, is authorized--
            (1) to initiate a United States plan to endorse non-

            (2) to instruct the United States Governor of the IDB to 
        work with the IDB Board of Governors to admit Taiwan as a non-
        borrowing member of the IDB.

              INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and not later than April 1 of each year thereafter for the following 5 
years, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of 
the Treasury, shall submit an unclassified report to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of

            (1) describes the United States plan to endorse and obtain 
        non-borrowing membership status for Taiwan at the IDB;
            (2) includes an account of the efforts made by the 
        Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury to 
        encourage IDB member states to promote Taiwan's bid to obtain 
        non-borrowing membership at the IDB; and
            (3) identifies the steps that the Secretary of State and 
        the Secretary of the Treasury will take to endorse and obtain 
        non-borrowing membership status for Taiwan at the IDB in the 
        following year.

SEC. 406. SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN ADMISSION TO THE IMF.

    (a) In General.--The United States Governor of the International 
Monetary Fund (in this section referred to as the ``Fund'') shall use 
the voice and vote of the United States to vigorously support--
            (1) the admission of Taiwan as a member of the Fund;
            (2) participation by Taiwan in regular surveillance 
        activities of the Fund with respect to the economic and 
        financial policies of Taiwan, consistent with Article IV 
        consultation procedures of the Fund;
            (3) employment opportunities for Taiwan nationals, without 
        regard to any consideration that, in the determination of the 
        United States Governor, does not generally restrict the 
        employment of nationals of member countries of the Fund; and
            (4) the ability of Taiwan to receive appropriate technical 
        assistance and training by the Fund.
    (b) Waiver.--The Secretary of the Treasury may waive any 
requirement of subsection (a) for 1 year at a time on reporting to 
Congress that providing the waiver will substantially promote the 
objective of securing the meaningful participation of Taiwan at each 
international financial institution (as defined in section 1701(c)(2) 
of the International Financial Institutions Act).
    (c) Sunset.--This section shall have no force or effect on the 
earlier of--
            (1) the date of approval by the Board of Governors of the 
        Fund for the admission of Taiwan as a member of the Fund; or
            (2) the date that is 10 years after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act.

SEC. 407. MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL 
              AVIATION ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
        should allow Taiwan to meaningfully participate in the 
        organization, including in ICAO triennial assembly sessions, 
        conferences, technical working groups, meetings, activities, 
        and mechanisms;
            (2) Taiwan is a global leader and hub for international 
        aviation, with a range of expertise, information, and resources 
        and the fifth busiest airport in Asia (Taoyuan International 
        Airport), and its meaningful participation in ICAO would 
        significantly enhance the ability of ICAO to ensure the safety 
        and security of global aviation; and
            (3) coercion by the Chinese Communist Party and the 
        People's Republic of China has ensured the systematic exclusion 
        of Taiwan from meaningful participation in ICAO, significantly 
        undermining the ability of ICAO to ensure the safety and 
        security of global aviation.
    (b) Plan for Taiwan's Meaningful Participation in the International 
Civil Aviation Organization.--The Secretary of State, in coordination 
with the Secretary of Commerce, is authorized--
            (1) to initiate a United States plan to secure Taiwan's 
        meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO triennial 
        assembly sessions, conferences, technical working groups, 
        meetings, activities, and mechanisms; and
            (2) to instruct the United States representative to the 
        ICAO to--
                    (A) use the voice and vote of the United States to 
                ensure Taiwan's meaningful participation in ICAO, 
                including in ICAO triennial assembly sessions, 
                conferences, technical working groups, meetings, 
                activities, and mechanisms; and
                    (B) seek to secure a vote at the next ICAO 
                triennial assembly session on the question of Taiwan's 
                participation in that session.
    (c) Report Concerning Taiwan's Meaningful Participation in the 
International Civil Aviation Organization.--Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later than April 1 
of each year thereafter for the following 6 years, the Secretary of 
State, in coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, shall submit an 
unclassified report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate 
and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives 
that--
            (1) describes the United States plan to ensure Taiwan's 
        meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO triennial 
        assembly sessions, conferences, technical working groups, 
        meetings, activities, and mechanisms;
            (2) includes an account of the efforts made by the 
        Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce to ensure 
        Taiwan's meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO 
        triennial assembly sessions, conferences, technical working 
        groups, meetings, activities, and mechanisms; and
            (3) identifies the steps the Secretary of State and the 
        Secretary of Commerce will take in the next year to ensure 
        Taiwan's meaningful participation in ICAO, including in ICAO 
        triennial assembly sessions, conferences, technical working 
        groups, meetings, activities, and mechanisms.

  TITLE V--ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT AND ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE 
                        UNITED STATES AND TAIWAN

SEC. 501. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Taiwan has been an important trading partner of the 
        United States for many years, accounting for $114,000,000,000 
        in two-way trade in 2021.
            (2) Taiwan has demonstrated the capacity to hold a strong 
        economic partnership with the United States. Along with a 
        robust trading profile of goods and services, Taiwan supports 
        an estimated 208,000 American jobs and its cumulative 
        investment in the United States is at least $13,700,000,000, 
        numbers that will only increase with a comprehensive bilateral 
        trade agreement.
            (3) In addition to supplementing United States goods and 
        services, Taiwan is a reliable partner in many United States 
        industries, which is not only critical for diversifying United 
        States supply chains, but is also essential to reducing the 
        United States reliance on other countries, such as China, who 
        seek to leverage supply chain inefficiencies in their path to 
        regional and global dominance. Such diversification of United 
        States supply chains is critical to our national security.
            (4) The challenges to establishing an agreement with 
        Taiwan, such as reaching an agreement on agricultural 
        standards, must not prevent the completion of a bilateral trade 
        agreement. Taiwan has already taken steps to further the 
        progress towards such an agreement by announcing its intent to 
        lift restrictions on United States pork and beef products, 
        which will greatly increase the accessibility of American 
        farmers and ranchers to Taiwan markets. In light of this 
        important development, the United States should immediately 
        move forward with substantial negotiations for a comprehensive 
        bilateral trade agreement with Taiwan.
            (5) A free and open Indo-Pacific is a goal that needs to be 
        actively pursued to counter China's use of unfair trading 
        practices and other policies to advance its economic dominance 
        in the Indo-Pacific region. An agreement with Taiwan would--
                    (A) help the United States accomplish this goal by 
                building a network of like-minded governments dedicated 
                to fair competition and open markets that are free from 
                government manipulation; and
                    (B) encourage other nations to deepen economic ties 
                with Taiwan.
            (6) Since November 2020, Taiwan and the United States have 
        engaged in the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership 
        Dialogue, covering a broad range of economic issues including--
                    (A) 5G networks and telecommunications security;
                    (B) supply chains resiliency;
                    (C) infrastructure cooperation;
                    (D) renewable energy;
                    (E) global health; and
                    (F) science and technology.
            (7) A trade agreement between the United States and Taiwan 
        would promote security and economic growth for the United 
        States, Taiwan, and the entire Indo-Pacific region.
            (8) Excluding Taiwan from the Indo-Pacific Economic 
        Framework would--
                    (A) create significant distortions in the regional 
                and global economic architecture; and
                    (B) run counter to the United States economic 
                interests.
            (9) Taiwan is the United States largest trading partner 
        with whom we do not have an income tax treaty or agreement. 
        Taiwan has such agreements with 34 countries, including 
        countries that have trade agreements with the United States and 
        do not maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
            (10) The American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, in its 
        ``2022 Taiwan White Paper'', called for the United States and 
        Taiwan to continue exploring an income tax agreement to boost 
        bilateral trade and investment by reducing double taxation and 
        increasing economic efficiency and integration.

SEC. 502. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON A FREE TRADE AGREEMENT AND BILATERAL TAX 
              AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN, THE INDO-PACIFIC ECONOMIC 
              FRAMEWORK, AND CBP PRECLEARANCE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Trade Representative should resume 
        meetings under the United States and Taiwan Trade and 
        Investment Framework Agreement with the goal of reaching a 
        bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan;
            (2) the United States Trade Representative should undertake 
        efforts to assess whether the Agreement Concerning Digital 
        Trade, signed at Washington October 7, 2019, and entered into 
        force January 1, 2020, between the United States and Japan, 
        provides a model for a similar agreement between the United 
        States and Taiwan to strengthen economic ties with Taiwan in 
        key sectors;
            (3) the United States Trade Representative and the 
        Secretary of Commerce should undertake efforts to assure 
        Taiwan's engagement and participation in the Indo-Pacific 
        Economic Framework;
            (4) the United States should utilize and expand 
        Preclearance programs to meet the needs of the United States 
        travel and tourism industry, including by prioritizing the 
        establishment of Preclearance facilities with Indo-Pacific 
        allies and partners, including Taiwan; and
            (5) the United States should--
                    (A) begin negotiations on an income tax agreement 
                between the American Institute in Taiwan and the Taipei 
                Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the 
                United States; and
                    (B) work on a congressional-executive agreement to 
                establish such an income tax agreement.

SEC. 503. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES-TAIWAN DEVELOPMENT 
              COOPERATION.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and Taiwan share common development 
        goals in a wide range of sectors, including public health, 
        agriculture, food security, democracy and governance, and 
        education;
            (2) enhanced cooperation between the United States and 
        Taiwan would better advance these goals; and
            (3) the United States Agency for International Development 
        should explore opportunities to partner with Taiwan on projects 
        in developing countries related to inclusive economic growth, 
        resilience, global health, education, infrastructure, 
        humanitarian assistance, disaster relief, and other areas.

            (2) describes the plan for the establishment of a 
        preclearance facility in Taiwan or in other countries in the 
        Indo-Pacific region;
            (3) assesses the impacts that preclearance operations in 
        Taiwan will have on--
                    (A) the security partnership between the United 
                States and Taiwan;
                    (B) trade between the United States and Taiwan, 
                including the impact on established supply chains;
                    (C) the tourism industry in the United States, 
                including the potential impact on revenue and tourist-
                related commerce;
                    (D) United States and foreign passengers traveling 
                to the United States for business-related activities;

SEC. 704. PROHIBITIONS AGAINST UNDERMINING UNITED STATES POLICY 
              REGARDING TAIWAN.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the efforts by the Government of 
the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party to 
compel private United States businesses, corporations, and 
nongovernmental entities to use language mandated by the People's 
Republic of China (referred to in this section as the ``PRC'') to 
describe the relationship between Taiwan and the PRC are an 
illegitimate attempt to enforce political censorship globally.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States Government, in coordination with United States businesses and 
nongovernmental entities, should formulate a code of conduct for, and 
otherwise coordinate on, interacting with the Government of the PRC and 
the Chinese Communist Party and their affiliated entities, the aim of 
which is--
            (1) to counter PRC operations that threaten free speech, 
        academic freedom, and the normal operations of United States 
        businesses and nongovernmental entities; and
            (2) to counter PRC efforts to censor the way the world 
        refers to issues deemed sensitive to the PRC Government and 
        Chinese Communist Party leaders, including issues related to 
        Taiwan, Tibet, the Tiananmen Square Massacre, and the mass 
        internment of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, among many 
        other issues.
    (c) Prohibition Against Recognizing the People's Republic of 
China's Claims to Sovereignty Over Taiwan.--
            (1) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) issues related to the sovereignty of Taiwan are 
                for the people of Taiwan to decide through the 
                democratic process they have established;
                    (B) the dispute between the PRC and Taiwan must be 
                resolved peacefully and with the assent of the people 
                of Taiwan;
                    (C) the 2 key obstacles to peaceful resolution 
                are--
                            (i) the authoritarian nature of the PRC 
                        political system under one-party rule of the 
                        Chinese Communist Party, which is fundamentally 
                        incompatible with Taiwan's democracy; and
                            (ii) the PRC's pursuit of coercion and 
                        aggression towards Taiwan, in potential 
                        violation of the third United States-PRC Joint 
                        Communique, which was completed on August 17, 
                        1982;
                    (D) any attempt to coerce or force the people of 
                Taiwan to accept a political arrangement that would 
                subject them to direct or indirect rule by the PRC, 
                including a ``one country, two systems'' framework, 
                would constitute a grave challenge to United States 
                security interests in the region.
            (2) Statement of policy.--It is the policy of the United 
        States to oppose any attempt by the PRC authorities to 
        unilaterally impose a timetable or deadline for unification on 
        Taiwan.
            (3) Prohibition on recognition of prc claims without the 
        assent of people of taiwan.--No department or agency of the 
        United States Government may formally or informally recognize 
        PRC claims to sovereignty over Taiwan without the assent of the 
        people of Taiwan, as expressed directly through the democratic 
        process.
    (d) Strategy To Protect United States Businesses and 
Nongovernmental Entities From Coercion.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of 
        the Treasury, and the heads of other relevant Federal agencies, 
        shall submit an unclassified report, with a classified annex, 
        if necessary, on how to protect United States businesses and 
        nongovernmental entities from PRC operations, including 
        coercion and threats that lead to censorship or self-
        censorship, or which compel compliance with political or 
        foreign policy positions of the Government of the People's 
        Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.
            (2) Elements.--The strategy shall include--
                    (A) information regarding efforts by the PRC 
                Government to censor the websites of United States 
                airlines, hotels, and other businesses regarding the 
                relationship between Taiwan and the PRC;
                    (B) information regarding efforts by the PRC 
                Government to target United States nongovernmental 
                entities through operations intended to weaken support 
                for Taiwan;
                    (C) information regarding United States Government

                information on best practices, current successes, and 
                existing barriers to responding to such threat; and
                    (D) details of any actions undertaken to create the 
                code of conduct described in subsection (b), including 
                a timetable for the implementation of such code of 
                conduct.

                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit certain members of the Chinese Communist Party from 
  entering the United States until such time as the Government of the 
    People's Republic of China ceases the theft of the intellectual 
         property of the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop China's IP Theft Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) China is perpetrating what Secretary of Defense Mark 
        Esper has called ``the greatest intellectual property theft in 
        human history''.
            (2) A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute 
        has found that since 2007 approximately 500 Chinese military 
        scientists were sent to the United States to study. According 
        to the report China has been sending soldiers to study science 
        and engineering in Western universities including the United 
        States as part of a widespread effort to collect military 
        technology.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to prohibit the entry of 
Chinese Communist Party leaders and military and government officials 
of the People's Republic of China into the United States until the 
Government of the People's Republic of China ceases its efforts to 
infringe on the intellectual property rights of the United States.

SEC. 4. RESTRICTION ON ISSUANCE OF VISAS.

and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall deny entry to the United 
States of, each of the following:

        including the Politburo, the Central Committee, and each 
        delegate to the 19th National Congress of the Chinese Communist 
        Party.
            (2) The spouses and children of the senior officials 
        described in paragraph (1).
            (3) Members of the cabinet of the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China.
            (4) Active duty members of the People's Liberation Army of 
        China.
    (b) Applicability.--The restriction under subsection (a) shall not 
apply for any year in which the Director of National Intelligence 
certifies to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate that the Government of the People's 
Republic of China has ceased sponsoring, funding, facilitating, and 
actively working to support efforts to infringe on the intellectual 
property rights of citizens and companies of the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

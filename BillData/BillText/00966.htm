                        to vote in the registrar's jurisdiction in

            ``(2) Public notice.--Not later than 48 hours after 
        conducting any general program to remove the names of 
        ineligible voters from the official list of eligible voters (as 
        described in section 8(a)(4)), the State shall disseminate a 
        public notice through such methods as may be reasonable to 
        reach the general public (including by publishing the notice in

        websites of the appropriate election officials) that list 
        maintenance is taking place and that registrants should check

                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Administrator of the Small Business Administration to 
 encourage entrepreneurship training in after school programs, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Entrepreneurship Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) entrepreneurship creates new jobs, grows the economy, 
        increases productivity, and significantly improves the quality 
        of life of the people of the United States;
            (2) entrepreneurship rates in the United States have 
        declined substantially over the last several decades;
            (3) children from disadvantaged communities are less likely 
        to become entrepreneurs and inventors, hampering economic 
        growth and harming communities most in need;
            (4) studies show that children with mentors in 
        entrepreneurship and inventorship are more likely to pursue 
        these fields in adulthood; and
            (5) in order to promote growth in disadvantaged 
        communities, increase entrepreneurship rates, and improve the 
        economy, volunteer mentors with the SCORE program should be 
        encouraged to engage with children in community learning 
        centers.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``community learning center'' has the meaning 
        given the term in section 4201(b) of the Elementary and 
        Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7171(b));
            (2) the term ``inventorship'' means the activity of 
        creating, designing, or otherwise originating a new product or 
        service; and
            (3) the term ``SCORE program'' means the Service Corps of 
        Retired Executives described in section 8(b)(1)(B) of the Small 
        Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(1)(B)).

SEC. 4. ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION FOR DISADVANTAGED YOUTH.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Small Business 
Administration shall--

        who are often underrepresented in critical and enriching 
        subjects about entrepreneurship and inventorship through 
        community learning centers;
            (2) develop and implement a strategy to encourage

        learning centers; and

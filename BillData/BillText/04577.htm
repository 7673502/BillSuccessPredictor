    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a Park District 
Community Support Grant Program under which the Secretary may award 
grants to eligible entities for projects to--
            (1) maintain land and water for parks and other outdoor 
        recreation purposes;
            (2) operate new or renovate existing outdoor recreation 
        facilities; and
            (3) build, operate, maintain, or refurbish indoor or 
        outdoor facilities owned and operated, in whole or in part by a 
        park district and used by or to support the public.
    (b) Matching Requirement.--
            (1) In general.--As a condition of receiving a grant under 
        subsection (a), an eligible entity shall provide matching funds 
        in the form of cash or in-kind contributions in an amount equal 
        to not less than 100 percent of the amounts made available 
        under the grant.
            (2) Sources.--The matching amounts referred to in paragraph 
        (1) may include amounts made available from State, local, 
        nongovernmental, or private sources.
            (3) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive all or part of the 
        matching requirement under paragraph (1) if the Secretary 
        determines that--
                    (A) no reasonable means are available through which 
                an applicant can meet the matching requirement; and
                    (B) the probable benefit of such project outweighs

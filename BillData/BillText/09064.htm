                                 A BILL


 
To enshrine the legacy of Jamal Khashoggi by protecting dissidents and 
journalists, codifying the Khashoggi Ban, and introducing the Khashoggi 
   Amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jamal Khashoggi Protection for 
Dissidents and Journalists Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Jamal Khashoggi was a resident of the United States 
        living in the Commonwealth of Virginia, a Saudi journalist, a 
        Washington Post columnist, and critical of the Saudi regime.
            (2) On October 2, 2018, Khashoggi was lured to the 
        Consulate of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul, Turkey 
        under the false cover of needing to address a consular matter.
            (3) While inside the Saudi consulate, Khashoggi was 
        murdered, and his body was dismembered by intelligence officers 
        of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
            (4) The Office of the Director of National Intelligence 
        determined in 2018 that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman 
        approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul.
            (5) A highly credible inquiry by the United Nations 
        concluded that Khashoggi's killing was premeditated and that 
        the mission was endorsed, planned, and overseen by senior Saudi 
        officials.

SEC. 3. KHASHOGGI AMENDMENT TO THE FOREIGN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITIES ACT.

    (a) General Exceptions to the Jurisdictional Immunity of a Foreign 
State.--Section 1605(a) of title 28, United States Code, is amended--

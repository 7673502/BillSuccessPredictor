  To repeal section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934 and ensure 
    reasonable, non-discriminatory access to online communications 
                               platforms.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Foundation for the 
Right to Express and Engage in Speech Act'' or the ``21st Century FREE 
Speech Act''.

SEC. 2. REASONABLE, NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS 
              PLATFORMS; BLOCKING AND SCREENING OF OFFENSIVE MATERIAL.

    (a) In General.--Part I of title II of the Communications Act of 
1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) by striking section 230; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 232. REASONABLE, NON-DISCRIMINATORY ACCESS TO ONLINE 
              COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORMS; BLOCKING AND SCREENING OF 
              OFFENSIVE MATERIAL.

    ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) The rapidly developing array of internet and other 
        interactive computer services available to individual Americans 
        represent an extraordinary advance in the availability of 
        educational and informational resources to our citizens.
            ``(2) These services often offer users a great degree of 
        control over the information that they receive, as well as the 
        potential for even greater control in the future as technology 
        continues to develop.
            ``(3) The internet and other interactive computer services 
        offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse and 
        viewpoints, unique opportunities for cultural development, and 
        myriad avenues for intellectual activity, and regulation of the 
        internet must be tailored to supporting those activities.
            ``(4) The internet and other interactive computer services 
        have flourished, to the benefit of all Americans, with a 
        minimum of government regulation, and regulation should be 
        limited to what is necessary to preserve the societal benefits 
        provided by the internet.
            ``(5) Increasingly Americans rely on internet platforms and 
        websites for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and 
        entertainment services and for communication with one another.
    ``(b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            ``(1) to promote the continued development of the internet 
        and other interactive computer services and other interactive 
        media;
            ``(2) to preserve a vibrant and competitive free market for 
        the internet and other interactive computer services;
            ``(3) to encourage the development of technologies which 
        maximize user control over what information is received by 
        individuals, families, and schools who use the internet and 
        other interactive computer services, rather than control and 
        censorship driven by interactive computer services;
            ``(4) to facilitate the development and utilization of 
        blocking and filtering technologies that empower parents to 
        restrict their children's access to objectionable or 
        inappropriate online material;
            ``(5)(A) to ensure that the internet serves as an open 
        forum for--
                    ``(i) a true diversity of discourse and viewpoints, 
                including political discourse and viewpoints;
                    ``(ii) unique opportunities for cultural 
                development; and
                    ``(iii) myriad avenues for intellectual activity; 
                and
            ``(B) given that the internet is the dominant platform for 
        communication and public debate today, to ensure that major 
        internet communications platforms, which function as common 
        carriers in terms of their size, usage, and necessity, are 
        available to all users on reasonable and non-discriminatory 
        terms free from public or private censorship of religious and 
        political speech;
            ``(6) to promote consumer protection and transparency 
        regarding information and content management practices by major 
        internet platforms to--
                    ``(A) ensure that consumers understand--
                            ``(i) the products they are using; and
                            ``(ii) what information is being presented 
                        to them and why; and
                    ``(B) prevent deceptive or undetectable actions 
                that filter the information presented to consumers; and
            ``(7) to ensure vigorous enforcement of Federal criminal 
        laws to deter and punish trafficking in online obscenity, 
        stalking, and harassment.

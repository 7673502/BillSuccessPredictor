                                 A BILL


 
To create a database of eviction information, establish grant programs 
 for eviction prevention and legal aid, and limit use of housing court-
      related records in consumer reports, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Emergencies Lifeline Program 
Act of 2022'' or the ``HELP Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) housing is fundamentally an issue of economic and 
        racial justice and a critical determinant of health;
            (2) the 2008 financial crisis was a Great Depression-level 
        event for Black Americans, wiping out decades of gains in Black 
        homeownership, which has now fallen to its lowest rate since 
        the passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1968;
            (3) Black borrowers were 76 percent more likely to have 
        lost their home to foreclosure than White borrowers during the 
        foreclosure crisis;
            (4) Black and Hispanic households continue to be about 
        twice as likely as White households to rent their homes;
            (5) in 2016, 58 percent of Black household heads and 54 
        percent of Hispanic household heads were renting their homes, 
        compared with 28 percent of White household heads;
            (6) while cost burdens affect households of all races and 
        ethnicities, Black and Brown renters are much more likely to be 
        burdened, with 55 percent of Black renters considered to be 
        rent burdened compared to only 43 percent of White renters;
            (7) Black households account for 12 percent of all 
        households in the United States, but 19 percent of all renters 
        and 26 of all renter households with extremely low incomes;
            (8) prior to the coronavirus pandemic, it was estimated 
        that around 3.7 million evictions are filed every year, a rate 
        of about 7 every minute;
            (9) across the United States, one in 20 renters faces an 
        eviction every year, but for Black renters, the number is one 
        in 11;
            (10) every day families are displaced by the eviction 
        crisis, a reality that is only further exacerbated by the 
        COVID-19 pandemic and that falls disproportionately on Black 
        renters, and particularly Black women renters;
            (11) the Department of Housing and Urban Development does 
        not require the reporting or collection of eviction data, 
        including among households in federally assisted housing, and 
        should be required to do so;
            (12) the American Civil Liberties Union's analysis of 
        Eviction Lab data found that, on average, ``Black renters had 
        evictions filed against them at nearly twice the rate of White 
        renters'' and that Black women specifically were filed against 
        for eviction at ``double the rate of White renters or higher in 
        17 of 36 [S]tates'';
            (13) right to counsel is a matter of racial justice, 
        equity, and ensuring equal protection under the law;
            (14) nationally, it is estimated that more than 81 percent 
        of landlords are represented in housing court proceedings, 
        compared to less than 3 percent of tenants in such proceedings;
            (15) a Massachusetts COVID-19 legal help project found that 
        when providing full legal representation to low-income tenants, 
        90 percent of cases closed resulted in positive outcomes, with 
        70 percent of tenants remaining in their homes and 20 percent 
        of tenants having more time to find a place to live; and
            (16) a California study of the Shriver Civil Counsel 
        Program found that 91 percent of Shriver cases ended with the 
        eviction record sealed, 81 percent with the eviction not 
        reported to a credit agency, and 71 percent with a neutral 
        reference provided by the landlord, tenants in such cases saved 
        nearly $800 more in reduced rent and other fees while paying 
        holdover damages or attorney's fees only half as often, and 71 
        percent of represented clients that had been required to move 
        had obtained a new rental unit, compared to 43 percent of 
        unrepresented tenants.

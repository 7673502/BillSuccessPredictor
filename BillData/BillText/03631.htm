To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to 
 revise certain ethylene oxide emissions standards under the Clean Air

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency (referred to in this section as the 
``Administrator'') shall amend subpart O of part 63 of title 40, Code 
of Federal Regulations--
            (1) to revise the standards for the emission of ethylene 
        oxide under that subpart based on the results described in the 
        report of the National Center for Environmental Assessment of 
        the Environmental Protection Agency entitled ``Evaluation of 
        the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide'' and dated 
        December 2016;
            (2) to apply maximum achievable control technology (within 
        the meaning of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)) 
        requirements to chamber exhaust vents; and
            (3) to apply to area sources and major sources (as those 
        terms are defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7412(a))) of ethylene oxide.
    (b) Residual Risk Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
on which the Administrator finalizes the revised standards required 
under subsection (a), the Administrator shall carry out a residual risk 
assessment pursuant to section 112(f)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 
U.S.C. 7412(f)(2)) with respect to the revised standards.
    (c) Notification.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the 
        Administrator learns of a violation of the standards revised 
        under subsection (a), the Administrator shall notify the public 
        of the violation in a manner determined to be appropriate by 
        the Administrator.
            (2) Failure to notify.--If the Administrator fails to 
        notify the public under paragraph (1) by the end of the period 
        described in that paragraph, the Inspector General of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency shall carry out an 
        investigation to determine--
                    (A) the reason or reasons for which the 
                Administrator failed to notify the public;
                    (B) the public health risks associated with the 
                failure of the Administrator to notify the public; and
                    (C) any steps the Administrator should take to 
                ensure the Administrator meets the requirements 
                described in paragraph (1) in the future.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

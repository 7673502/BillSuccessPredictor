To amend the Federal Power Act to authorize the allocation of the costs 
 of certain interstate electric power transmission lines and electric 
   power transmission lines that are located offshore, and for other 
                               purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Electric Grid Resilience 
Act''.

SEC. 2. ALLOCATION OF COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.

    Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824 et seq.) is amended 
by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 224. ALLOCATION OF COSTS OF CERTAIN TRANSMISSION FACILITIES.

    ``(a) Allocation of Costs.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any entity that proposes to own, 
        control, or operate a transmission facility of national 
        significance may file a tariff with the Commission in 
        accordance with section 205 and the regulations of the 
        Commission allocating the costs of such transmission facility 
        of national significance.
            ``(2) Cost causation principle.--The Commission shall 
        require that any tariff filed under paragraph (1) allocate the 
        costs of a transmission facility of national significance to 
        customers within the applicable transmission planning region or 
        regions in a manner that is at least roughly commensurate with 
        the estimated anticipated benefits described in paragraph (3).
            ``(3) Cost allocation principle.--The Commission shall 
        require that any tariff filed under paragraph (1) allocate 
        costs based on the broad range of reliability, economic, public 
        policy, resilience, and other reasonably anticipated benefits 
        of the applicable transmission facility of national 
        significance.
    ``(b) Transmission Facility of National Significance.--In this 
section, the term `transmission facility of national significance' 
means--
            ``(1) an interstate electric power transmission line (and 
        any facilities necessary for the operation of such electric 
        power transmission line) or an electric power transmission line 
        that is located offshore (and any facilities necessary for the 
        operation of such electric power transmission line)--
                    ``(A) that has a transmission capacity of not less 
                than 1,000 megawatts; and
                    ``(B) the construction of which is completed on or 
                after the date of enactment of this section; or
            ``(2) an expansion of, or upgrade to, an interstate 
        electric power transmission line (and any facilities necessary 
        for the operation of such electric power transmission line) or 
        an electric power transmission line that is located offshore 
        (and any facilities necessary for the operation of such 
        electric power transmission line) that--
                    ``(A) increases the transmission capacity of such 
                electric power transmission line by at least 500 
                megawatts; and
                    ``(B) is completed on or after the date of 
                enactment of this section.
    ``(c) Savings Provision.--This section does not affect the 
authority of the Commission to approve the allocation of costs of 
transmission facilities other than transmission facilities of national 
significance.''.

                                 A BILL


 
 To make updates to the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and 
            Other Illicit Financing, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Terrorist and Other 
Illicit Financing Act''.

SEC. 2. INCLUDING OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND TERRITORIES IN THE HIGH-
              RISK MONEY LAUNDERING AND RELATED FINANCIAL CRIME AREAS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Department of Justice, human 
        trafficking is ``a crime that involves exploiting a person for 
        labor, services, or commercial sex'', a global illicit trade 
        that is estimated by Global Financial Integrity to be valued at 
        more than $150.2 billion each year.
            (2) Polaris, the non-governmental organization which runs 
        the United States National Human Trafficking Hotline, has found 
        that while human trafficking is a nationwide problem, the 
        majority of domestic human trafficking victims are ``people who 
        have historically faced discrimination and its political, 
        social and economic consequences: people of color, indigenous 
        communities, immigrants and people who identify as LGBTQ+''.
            (3) For this reason, it is important that law enforcement 
        representing native communities and territories are part of the 
        national dialogue about countering human trafficking.
            (4) The High Intensity Financial Crime Areas program, which 
        is intended to concentrate law enforcement efforts at the 
        Federal, State, and local level to combat money laundering in 
        designated high-intensity money laundering zones, considers 
        human trafficking among other financial crime issues and 
        actors.
            (5) In each High Intensity Financial Crime Area, a money-
        laundering action team, comprised of relevant Federal, State, 
        and local enforcement authorities, prosecutors, and financial 
        regulators, works together to coordinate Federal, State, and 
        local anti-money laundering effort.
            (6) The High Intensity Financial Crime Area program does 
        not currently mandate the inclusion of law enforcement and 
        other agencies from Tribes and territories.
            (7) Further, the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist 
        and Other Illicit Financing, a valuable report which is 
        scheduled to sunset in January 2022, does not currently mandate 
        the inclusion of law enforcement and other agencies from Tribes 
        and Territories.
    (b) National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and Other Illicit 
Financing.--The Countering Russian Influence in Europe and Eurasia Act 
of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 9501 et seq.) is amended--

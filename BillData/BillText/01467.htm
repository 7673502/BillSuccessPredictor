    This Act may be cited as the ``Menstrual Equity in the Peace Corps

SEC. 2. ACCESS TO MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS FOR PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS.

    Section 5A of the Peace Corps Act (22 U.S.C. 2504a) is amended--
            (1) by transferring subsection (e) (relating to 
        antimalarial drugs) to appear immediately after subsection (b) 
        and redesignating such transferred subsection as the first 
        subsection (c);
            (2) in such first subsection (c), as so redesignated and 
        transferred, by striking ``The Director'' and inserting the 
        following:
            ``(1) In general.--The Director'';
            (3) in the second subsection (c) (relating to certain 
        training), by--
                    (A) redesignating such second subsection (c) as 
                paragraph (2); and
                    (B) moving such paragraph (2) two ems to the right;
            (4) by redesignating subsection (d) (relating to review and 
        evaluation) as subsection (e); and
            (5) by inserting before such redesignated subsection (e) 
        the following new subsection:
    ``(d) Access to Menstrual Products.--
            ``(1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this subsection, the Director of the Peace 
        Corps shall establish a comprehensive policy to ensure Peace 
        Corps volunteers who require menstrual products are able to 
        access such products, either by increasing stipends for such 
        volunteers to purchase such products or providing such 
        volunteers with such products in the generic product types 
        selected by such volunteer as their preferences.
            ``(2) Consideration.--The policy required under paragraph 
        (1) shall take into consideration the availability of menstrual 
        products for purchase locally, the price of such products, and 
        cultural norms regarding menstruation.
            ``(3) Cost.--If stipends are increased pursuant to the 
        policy required under paragraph (1), the Director of the Peace 
        Corps shall ensure that such increase covers fully the cost of 
        menstrual products purchased by Peace Corps volunteers 
        described in such paragraph.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

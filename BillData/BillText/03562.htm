        related fatalities and serious injuries within a specified 
        timeframe, not to exceed 20 years, that is consistent with a 
        State strategic highway safety plan and uses existing 
        transportation data and consideration of risk factors;
            (2) plans for the implementation of, and education of the 
        public about, such programs, strategies, and policies;
            (3) a description of how such programs, strategies, or 
        policies will--
                    (A) equitably invest in the safety needs of low-

                    (B) protect the rights of members of such 
                communities with respect to title VI of the Civil

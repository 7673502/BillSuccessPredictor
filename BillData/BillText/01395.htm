 To require the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to discount 
 FHA single-family mortgage insurance premium payments for first-time 
    homebuyers who complete a financial literacy housing counseling 
                                program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

              HOMEBUYERS WHO COMPLETE FINANCIAL LITERACY HOUSING 
              COUNSELING PROGRAMS.

    The second sentence of subparagraph (A) of section 203(c)(2) of the 
National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)(2)(A)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting before the comma the following: ``and such 
        program is completed before the mortgagor has signed an 
        application for a mortgage to be insured under this title or a 
        sales agreement''; and
            (2) by striking ``not exceed 2.75 percent of the amount of 
        the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage'' and 
        inserting ``be 25 basis points lower than the premium payment 
        amount established by the Secretary under the first sentence of 
        this subparagraph''.

            Passed the House of Representatives April 20, 2021.

            Attest:

                                             CHERYL L. JOHNSON,

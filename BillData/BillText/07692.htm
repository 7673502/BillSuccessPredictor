    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizens Inflation Relief

SEC. 2. TEMPORARY INCREASE TO EXEMPT AMOUNT.

    (a) Exempt Amount Increased.--Section 203(f)(8) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 403(f)(8)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
            ``(F)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
        subsection, the exempt amount which is applicable to an 
        individual other than an individual described in subparagraph 
        (D) shall be, for each month of any taxable year ending after 
        2021 and before 2024, $2,046.67.
            ``(ii) In determining the exempt amount applicable to an 
        individual other than an individual described in subparagraph 
        (D) for each month of any taxable year ending after 2023 and 
        before 2025, clause (i) of subparagraph (B) shall be applied as 
        if the exempt amount for each month of any taxable year ending 
        after 2021 and before 2024 were determined without regard to 
        clause (i) of this subparagraph.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 203(f)(8)(B) of such Act (42 
U.S.C. 403(f)(8)(B)) is amended, in the matter preceding clause (i)--
            (1) by striking ``subparagraph (D), the exempt'' and 
        inserting ``subparagraphs (D) and (F), the exempt''; and
            (2) by striking ``such subparagraph'' and inserting 
        ``subparagraph (D)''.
    (c) Social Security Trust Funds Held Harmless.--There are 
authorized to be appropriated to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors 
Insurance Trust Fund amounts equal to the increase in expenditures from 
such Trust Fund as a result of the amendments made by this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

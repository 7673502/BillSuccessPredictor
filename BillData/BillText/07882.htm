                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                              May 27, 2022

 Mr. Casten (for himself, Mr. Crow, Mr. Moulton, Mr. Gallego, and Ms. 
   Escobar) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the 
                      Committee on Armed Services

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 10, United States Code, to codify certain clean energy 
     targets of the Department of Defense, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Depend on Domestic Clean Energy 
Act'' or the ``DOD Clean Energy Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Defense, the agency charged with 
        protecting the national security of the United States, observed 
        as early as 1990 that climate change threatens our military 
        readiness.
            (2) As of 2019, the Department of Defense is the single 
        largest consumer of energy in the United States, and the single 
        largest institutional consumer of petroleum in the world.
            (3) Since 2001, the Department of Defense has consistently 
        consumed between 77 and 80 percent of all energy consumption of 
        the United States Government.
            (4) As climate change brings more extreme weather, water 
        and soil stress, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, glacial 
        melt, and pollution, greater global tensions over food and 
        water insecurity, resource scarcity, living patterns, and 
        climate-related migration will emerge.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that any unobligated amounts for the 
Energy Resilience and Conservation Investment Program of the Department 
of Defense at the end of fiscal year 2022 should remain available for 
obligation by the Department after such fiscal year for deserving 
projects so that the Department is able to appropriately vet those 
projects while increasing staffing.

SEC. 4. CODIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CLEAN ENERGY 
              TARGETS.

    (a) Codification.--Section 2911(g) of title 10, United States Code, 
is amended--
            (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and

        following new paragraphs (1) through (3):
    ``(1) It shall be the target of the Department of Defense, with 
respect to the activities, personnel, resources, and facilities of the 
Department located within the United States--
            ``(A) to achieve at least 40 percent carbon pollution-free 
        electricity on a net annual basis by 2024 within all such 
        facilities of the Department;
            ``(B) to achieve 100 percent carbon pollution-free 
        electricity on a net annual basis by 2030 within all such 
        facilities of the Department;
            ``(C) to reduce emissions from installation procurement by 
        at least 20 percent by 2024 and to achieve net-zero emissions 
        from installation procurement by 2050;
            ``(D) to reduce emissions from buildings on Department 
        installations by 50 percent by 2032 and to achieve net-zero 
        emissions from buildings on installations by 2045;
            ``(E) to reduce emissions from Department operations by 65 
        percent by 2030 and support the achievement of net-zero 
        emissions from Department operations by 2050; and
            ``(F) to achieve 100 percent zero-emission vehicle 
        acquisitions for nontactical vehicles by 2035, including 100 
        percent zero-emission light-duty vehicle acquisitions by 2027, 
        and to work towards 100 percent zero-emission tactical vehicle 
        acquisitions by 2045.
    ``(2) The Secretary of Defense may issue an exemption to the 
targets under paragraph (1) with respect to an activity of an agency, 
and any related personnel, resources, and facilities if the Secretary--
            ``(A) determines that the exemption is in the national 
        security interests of the United States; and
            ``(B) submits to the congressional defense committees 
        notice in writing of the exemption within 30 days of issuing 
        the exemption.
    ``(3)(A) The Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees an annual report on the progress the Department of 
Defense has made towards achieving the targets under paragraph (1). 
Each such report shall cover activities to achieve such targets 
conducted during the year preceding the date of the submittal of the 
report and shall include--
            ``(i) an identification of outstanding funding and staffing 
        resources need to implement such activities;
            ``(ii) a description of any planned activities the 
        Secretary intends to carry out in order to meet such targets, 
        including how the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 
        military departments, and Defense agencies plan to collaborate 
        to implement such activities; and
            ``(iii) a plan to increase production of renewable energy 
        on Department of Defense installations and pursue any energy 
        reduction or conservation efforts.
    ``(B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall be made publicly 
available on an appropriate website of the Department of Defense.''; 
and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
    ``(5) The Secretary of Defense shall delegate the responsibility 
for carrying out this subsection to the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Energy, Installations, and Environment.''.
    (b) Non-Domestic Application of Targets.--The Secretary of Defense 
may apply, in whole or in part, the targets set forth in section 
2911(g)(1) of title 10, United States Code, as amended by subsection 
(a), with respect to the activities, personnel, resources, and 
facilities of the Department of Defense located outside of the United 
States if the Secretary determines such application to be in the 
interest of the United States.

                and limitations of each type of vehicle propulsion 
                (such as speed, acceleration, noise production, time to 
                refuel or recharge, range, and operational duration),

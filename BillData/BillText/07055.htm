                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Public Health Service Act with regard to research on 
                    asthma, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Elijah E. Cummings Family Asthma 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in 2017 more than 25,100,000 people in the United 
        States had been diagnosed with asthma, including an estimated 
        6,200,000 children.
            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, asthma usually affects racial and ethnic 
        minorities, including African Americans, American Indians, 
        Alaska Natives, Puerto Ricans, and people of multiple races 
        more than non-Hispanic Whites. In 2017, Puerto Ricans and 
        African Americans had the highest lifetime prevalence of asthma 
        at 20.6 and 15.2 percent, respectively.
            (3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, among children, males have higher rates of asthma 
        than females, and in adults women have higher rates of asthma 
        than men. Individuals living below the poverty threshold also 
        had significantly higher rates of asthma in 2017 than 
        individuals living above the poverty threshold.
            (4) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in 2017 more than 3,500 people in the United States 
        died from asthma. The rate of mortality from asthma is higher 
        among African Americans and women.
            (5) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 
        that asthma accounted for approximately 180,000 
        hospitalizations and 1,800,000 visits to hospital emergency 
        departments in 2016.
            (6) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, the annual cost of asthma to the United States is 
        approximately $81,900,000,000, including $3,000,000,000 in 
        indirect costs from missed days of school and work.
            (7) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, 5,200,000 school days and 8,500,000 work days are 
        missed annually as a result of asthma.
            (8) Asthma episodes can be triggered by both outdoor air 
        pollution and indoor air pollution, including pollutants such 
        as cigarette smoke and combustion by-products. Asthma episodes 
        can also be triggered by indoor allergens such as animal dander 
        and outdoor allergens such as pollen and molds.
            (9) Public health interventions and medical care in 
        accordance with existing guidelines have been proven effective 
        in the treatment and management of asthma. Better asthma 
        management could reduce the numbers of emergency department 
        visits and hospitalizations due to asthma. Studies published in 
        medical journals, including the Journal of Asthma and The 
        Journal of Pediatrics, have shown that better asthma management 
        results in improved asthma outcomes at a lower cost.
            (10) In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention reported that less than half of people with asthma 
        reported receiving self-management training for their asthma. 
        More education about triggers, proper treatment, and asthma 
        management methods is needed.
            (11) The alarming rise in the prevalence of asthma, its 
        adverse effect on school attendance and productivity, and its 
        cost for hospitalizations and emergency room visits, highlight 
        the importance of public health interventions, including 
        increasing awareness of asthma as a chronic illness, its 
        symptoms, the role of both indoor and outdoor environmental 
        factors that exacerbate the disease, and other factors that 
        affect its exacerbations and severity. The goals of the Federal 
        Government and its partners in the nonprofit and private 
        sectors should include reducing the number and severity of 
        asthma attacks, asthma's financial burden, and the health 
        disparities associated with asthma.
            (12) The high health and financial burden caused by asthma 
        underscores the importance of adherence to the National Asthma 
        Education and Prevention Guidelines of the National Heart, 
        Lung, and Blood Institute. Increasing adherence to guidelines-
        based care and resulting patient management practices will 
        enhance the quality of life for patients with asthma and 
        decrease asthma-related morbidity and mortality.

                                 A BILL


 
To require the head of each Executive agency to submit a report on the 
  effects of requiring the employees of such agency to be vaccinated 
               against COVID-19, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Forbidding Repressive Executive 
Efforts and Denouncing Overreaching Mandates Act'' or the ``FREEDOM 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) President Biden's recent Executive order on COVID-19 
        vaccine mandates is both unconstitutional and a Federal 
        overreach.
            (2) The decision to be vaccinated should only be made and 
        known between an individual and his or her doctor.
            (3) A Federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate is an infringement 
        upon an individual's freedom, rights, and liberty.
            (4) A Federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate does not properly 
        consider the strength of natural immunity.
            (5) Individuals, businesses, localities, and States should 
        have the personal choice whether or not to be vaccinated 
        against COVID-19.

SEC. 3. REPORT ON FEDERAL EMPLOYEE COVID-19 VACCINATION MANDATE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the head of each Executive agency shall submit 
to Congress--
            (1) a report on the effects of a requirement that the 
        employees of such Executive agency be vaccinated against the 
        COVID-19 virus, including--
                    (A) the estimated number of employees of such 
                Executive agency--
                            (i) who do not intend to get vaccinated; 
                        and
                            (ii) who would leave such Executive agency 
                        due to such a requirement;
                    (B) the effects on the workforce of such Executive 
                agency and on the ability of such Executive agency to 
                carry out the mission of such Executive agency 
                resulting from such employees leaving due to such a 
                requirement;
                    (C) any plans of such Executive agency to mitigate 
                any loss of institutional knowledge resulting from such 
                employees leaving due to such a requirement; and
                    (D) estimates of how long such Executive agency 
                will take to fill the positions left vacant by such 
                employees leaving due to such a requirement and the 
                costs of filling such positions; and
            (2) a certification whether such a requirement will 
        adversely affect the ability of such Executive agency to carry 
        out the mission of such Executive agency.
    (b) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) Employee.--The term ``employee'' has the meaning given 
        such term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.
            (2) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has 
        the meaning given such term in section 105 of title 5, United 
        States Code.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

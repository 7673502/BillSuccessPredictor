SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) is leveraging its 
        political, diplomatic, economic, military, technological, and 
        ideological power to become a strategic, near-peer, global 
        competitor of the United States. The policies increasingly 
        pursued by the PRC in these domains are contrary to the 
        interests and values of the United States, its partners, and 
        much of the rest of the world.
            (2) A number of policies being pursued by the PRC--
                    (A) threaten the future character of the 
                international order and are shaping the rules, norms, 
                and institutions that govern relations among states;
                    (B) will put at risk the ability of the United 
                States to secure its national interests; and
                    (C) will put at risk the future peace, prosperity, 
                and freedom of the international community in the 
                coming decades.
            (3) After normalizing diplomatic relations with the PRC in 
        1979, the United States actively worked to advance the PRC's 
        economic and social development to ensure that it participated 
        in, and benefited from, the free and open international order. 
        The United States pursued these goals and contributed to the 
        welfare of the Chinese people by--
                    (A) increasing the PRC's trade relations and access 
                to global capital markets;
                    (B) promoting the PRC's accession to the World 
                Trade Organization;
                    (C) providing development finance and technical 
                assistance;
                    (D) promoting research collaboration;
                    (E) educating the PRC's top students;
                    (F) permitting transfers of cutting-edge 
                technologies and scientific knowledge; and
                    (G) providing intelligence and military assistance.
            (4) It is now clear that the PRC has chosen to pursue 
        state-led, mercantilist economic policies, an increasingly 
        authoritarian governance model at home through increased 
        restrictions on personal freedoms, and an aggressive and 
        assertive foreign policy. These policies frequently and 
        deliberately undermine United States interests and are contrary 
        to core United States values and the values of other nations, 
        both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. In response to this 
        strategic decision of the CCP, the United States has been 
        compelled to reexamine and revise its strategy towards the PRC 
        and reanimate its defense of the international order.
            (5) The General Secretary of the CCP and the Chairman of 
        the People's Republic of China, Xi Jinping, has elevated the 
        ``Great Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation'' as central to the 
        domestic and foreign policy of the PRC. His program demands--
                    (A) strong, centralized CCP leadership;
                    (B) concentration of military power;
                    (C) a dominant role for the CCP in the state and 
                the economy;
                    (D) an aggressive foreign policy seeking control 
                over broadly asserted territorial claims; and
                    (E) the denial of any universal values and 
                individual rights that are deemed to threaten the CCP.
            (6) The PRC views its Leninist model of governance as 
        superior to, and at odds with, the constitutional models of the 
        United States and other democracies. This approach to 
        governance is lauded by the CCP as essential to securing the 
        PRC's status as a global leader, and to shaping the future of 
        the world. In a 2013 speech, General Secretary Xi said, ``We 
        firmly believe that as socialism with Chinese characteristics 
        develops further . . . it is . . . inevitable that the 
        superiority of our socialist system will be increasingly 
        apparent . . . [and] our country's road of development will 
        have increasingly greater influence on the world.''.
            (7) The PRC's objectives are to first establish regional 
        hegemony over the Indo-Pacific and then to use that dominant 
        position to propel the PRC to become the ``leading world 
        power'', shaping an international order that is conducive to 
        the its interests. Achieving these objectives requires turning 
        the PRC into a wealthy nation under strict CCP rule by using a 
        strong military and advanced technological capability to pursue 
        the PRC's objectives, regardless of other countries' interests.
            (8) The PRC is reshaping the current international order, 
        which is built upon the rule of law and free and open ideals 
        and principles, by conducting global information and influence 
        operations, seeking to redefine international laws and norms to 
        align with the objectives of the CCP, rejecting the legitimacy 
        of internationally recognized human rights, and seeking to co-
        opt the leadership and agenda of multinational organizations 
        for the benefit of the PRC and other authoritarian regimes at 
        the expense of the interests of the United States and the 
        international community.
            (9) The PRC is encouraging other countries to follow its 
        model of development and governance. During the 19th Party 
        Congress in 2017, General Secretary Xi said that the PRC could 
        serve as a model of development for other countries by 
        utilizing ``Chinese wisdom'' and a ``Chinese approach to 
        solving problems''.
            (10) The PRC is promoting its governance model and 
        attempting to weaken other models of governance by--
                    (A) undermining democratic institutions;
                    (B) subverting financial institutions;
                    (C) coercing businesses to accommodate the policies 
                of the PRC; and
                    (D) using disinformation to disguise the nature of 
                the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).
            (11) The PRC is progressing toward becoming the global 
        leader in science and technology. In May 2018, General 
        Secretary Xi said that for the PRC to reach ``prosperity and 
        rejuvenation'', it needs to ``endeavor to be a major world 
        center for science and innovation''. The PRC has invested the 
        equivalent of billions of dollars into education and research 
        and development and established joint scientific research 
        centers and science universities.
            (12) The PRC's drive to become a ``manufacturing and 
        technological superpower'' and to promote ``innovation with 
        Chinese characteristics'' is coming at the expense of human 
        rights and longstanding international rules and norms with 
        respect to economic competition, and presents a challenge to 
        United States national security and the security of allies and 
        like-minded countries. In particular, the PRC advances its 
        illiberal political and social policies through mass 
        surveillance, social credit systems, and a significant role of 
        the state in internet governance. Through these means, the PRC 
        increases direct and indirect government control over its 
        citizens' everyday lives. Its national strategy of ``civil-
        military fusion'' mandates that civil and commercial research, 
        which increasingly drives global innovation, is leveraged to 
        develop new military capabilities.
            (13) The PRC is using legal and illegal means to achieve 
        its objective of becoming a manufacturing and technological 
        superpower. The PRC uses state-directed industrial policies in 
        anticompetitive ways to ensure the dominance of PRC companies. 
        The CCP engages in and encourages actions that actively 
        undermine a free and open international market, such as 
        intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, 
        regulatory and financial subsidies, and mandatory CCP access to 
        proprietary data as part of business and commercial agreements 
        between Chinese and foreign companies.
            (14) The policies referred to in paragraph (13) are 
        designed to freeze United States and other foreign firms out of 
        the PRC market, while eroding competition in other important 
        markets. The heavy subsidization of Chinese companies includes 
        potential violation of its World Trade Organization 
        commitments. In May 2018, General Secretary Xi said that the 
        PRC aims to keep the ``initiatives of innovation and 
        development security . . . in [China's] own hands''.
            (15) The PRC is advancing its global objectives through a 
        variety of avenues, including its signature initiative, the 
        Belt and Road Initiative (referred to in this section as 
        ``BRI''), which is enshrined in the Chinese Constitution and 
        includes the Digital Silk Road and Health Silk Road. The PRC 
        describes BRI as a straightforward and wholly beneficial plan 
        for all countries. Eventually, it seeks to create a web of 
        economic relations with the PRC at its center, making it the 
        most concrete geographical representation of the PRC's global 
        ambitions. BRI increases the economic influence of state-owned 
        PRC firms in global markets, enhances the PRC's political 
        leverage with government leaders around the world, and provides 
        greater access to strategic nodes such as ports and railways. 
        Through BRI, the PRC seeks political deference through economic 
        dependence.
            (16) The PRC is executing a plan to establish regional 
        hegemony over the Indo-Pacific and displace the United States 
        from the region. As a Pacific power, the United States has 
        built and supported enduring alliances and economic 
        partnerships that secure peace and prosperity and promote the 
        rule of law and political pluralism in a free and open Indo-
        Pacific. In contrast, the PRC uses economic and military 
        coercion in the region to secure its own interests.
            (17) The PRC's military strategy seeks to keep the United 
        States military from operating in the Western Pacific and 
        erodes United States security guarantees.
            (18) The PRC is aggressively pursuing exclusive control of 
        critical land routes, sea lanes, and air space in the Indo-
        Pacific in the hopes of eventually exercising greater influence 
        beyond the region. This includes lanes crucial to commercial 
        activity, energy exploration, transport, and the exercise of 
        security operations in areas permitted under international law.
            (19) The PRC seeks so-called ``reunification'' with Taiwan 
        through whatever means may ultimately be required. The CCP's 
        insistence that so-called ``reunification'' is Taiwan's only 
        option makes this goal inherently coercive. In January 2019, 
        General Secretary Xi stated that the PRC ``make[s] no promise 
        to renounce the use of force and reserve[s] the option of 
        taking all necessary means''. Taiwan's embodiment of democratic 
        values and economic liberalism challenges General Secretary 
        Xi's goal of achieving national rejuvenation. The PRC plans to 
        exploit Taiwan's dominant strategic position in the First 
        Island Chain and to project power into the Second Island Chain 
        and beyond.
            (20) In the South China Sea, the PRC has executed an 
        illegal island-building campaign that threatens freedom of 
        navigation and the free-flow of commerce, damages the 
        environment, bolsters the PLA power projection capabilities, 
        and coerces and intimidates other regional claimants in an 
        effort to advance its unlawful claims and control the waters 
        around neighboring countries. Despite General Secretary Xi's 
        September 2015 speech, in which he said the PRC was not 
        militarizing the South China Sea, during the 2017 19th Party 
        Congress, General Secretary Xi announced that ``construction on 
        islands and reefs in the South China Sea have seen steady 
        progress''.
            (21) The PRC is rapidly modernizing the PLA to attain a 
        level of capacity and capability superior to the United States 
        in terms of equipment and conduct of modern military operations 
        by shifting its military doctrine from having a force 
        ``adequate [for] China's defensive needs'' to having a force 
        ``commensurate with China's international status''. Ultimately, 
        this transformation could enable China to impose its will in 
        the Indo-Pacific region through the threat of military force. 
        In 2017, General Secretary Xi established the following 
        developmental benchmarks for the advancement of the PLA:
                    (A) A mechanized force with increased informatized 
                and strategic capabilities by 2020.
                    (B) The complete modernization of China's national 
                defense by 2035.
                    (C) The full transformation of the PLA into a 
                world-class force by 2050.
            (22) The PRC's strategy and supporting policies described 
        in this section undermine United States interests, such as--
                    (A) upholding a free and open international order;
                    (B) maintaining the integrity of international 
                institutions with liberal norms and values;
                    (C) preserving a favorable balance of power in the 
                Indo-Pacific;
                    (D) ensuring the defense of its allies;
                    (E) preserving open sea and air lanes;
                    (F) fostering the free flow of commerce through 
                open and transparent markets; and
                    (G) promoting individual freedom and human rights.
            (23) The global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified and 
        accelerated these trends in the PRC's behavior and therefore 
        increased the need for United States global leadership and a 
        competitive posture. The PRC has capitalized on the world's 
        focus on the COVID-19 pandemic by--
                    (A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong Kong's 
                autonomy, including imposing a so-called ``national 
                security law'' on Hong Kong;
                    (B) aggressively imposing its will in the East and 
                South China Seas;
                    (C) increasing its territorial aggression in South 
                Asia, including against India; and
                    (D) engaging in a widespread and government-
                directed disinformation campaign to obscure the PRC 
                Government's efforts to cover up the seriousness of 
                COVID-19, sow confusion about the origination of the 
                outbreak, and discredit the United States, its allies, 
                and global health efforts.
            (24) The CCP's disinformation campaign referred to in 
        paragraph (24)(D) has included--
                    (A) concerted efforts, in the early days of the 
                pandemic, to downplay the nature and scope of the 
                outbreak in Wuhan in the PRC, as well as cases of 
                person-to-person transmission;
                    (B) claims that the virus originated in United 
                States biological defense research at Fort Detrick, 
                Maryland;
                    (C) Chinese state media reports insinuating a 
                possible link between the virus and other United States 
                biological facilities; and
                    (D) efforts to block access to qualified 
                international infectious disease experts who might 
                contradict the CCP's narrative.
            (25) In response to the PRC's strategy and policies, the 
        United States must adopt a policy of strategic competition with 
        the PRC to protect and promote our vital interests and values.
            (26) The United States policy of strategic competition with 
        respect to the People's Republic of China is part of a broader 
        strategic approach to the Indo-Pacific and the world that 
        aligns with cooperation with United States allies and partners 
        to advance shared values and interests and to preserve and 
        enhance a free, open, democratic, inclusive, rules-based, 
        stable, and diverse region.
            (27) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public 
        Law 115-409) contributed to a comprehensive framework for 
        promoting United State security interests, economic interests, 
        and values in the Indo-Pacific region, investing $7,500,000,000 
        over 5 years--
                    (A) to support greater security and defense 
                cooperation between the United States and allies and 
                partners in the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (B) to advance democracy and the protection and 
                promotion of human rights in the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (C) to enhance cybersecurity cooperation between 
                the United States and partners in the Indo-Pacific;
                    (D) to deepen people-to-people engagement through 
                programs such as the Young Southeast Asian Leaders 
                Initiative and the ASEAN Youth Volunteers program; and
                    (E) to enhance energy cooperation and energy 
                security in the Indo-Pacific region.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Objectives.--It is the policy of the United States to pursue 
the following objectives:
            (1) The United States global leadership role is sustained 
        and its political system and major foundations of national 
        power are secured for the long-term in the political, economic, 
        technological, and military domains.
            (2) The United States position as an indispensable power in 
        the Indo-Pacific and globally is sustained through diplomacy, 
        multilateralism, and engagement.
            (3) The United States deters military confrontation with 
        the PRC and both nations work to reduce the risk of conflict.
            (4) The United States and its allies maintain a stable 
        balance of power in the Indo-Pacific with China. The United 
        States and its allies maintain unfettered access to the region, 
        including through freedom of navigation and the free flow of 
        commerce, consistent with international law and practice.
            (5) The allies and partners of the United States--
                    (A) maintain confidence in United States leadership 
                and its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (B) can withstand and combat subversion by the PRC; 
                and
                    (C) work closely with the United States in setting 
                global rules, norms, and standards that benefit the 
                international community.
            (6) The combined economic and military strength of the 
        United States and its allies and partners demonstrates to the 
        PRC that the risks of attempts to dominate other states 
        outweigh the potential benefits.
            (7) The United States leads the free, open, and rules-based 
        international order, which comprises resilient states and 
        institutions that uphold and defend principles, such as 
        sovereignty, rule of law, individual freedom, and human rights. 
        The international order is strong enough to withstand attempts 
        at destabilization by illiberal and authoritarian actors.
            (8) The key rules, norms, and standards of international 
        engagement in the 21st century are maintained, including--
                    (A) the protection of human rights, commercial 
                engagement and investment, and technology; and
                    (B) that such rules, norms, and standards are in 
                alignment with the values and interests of the United 
                States, its allies and partners, and other stakeholders 
                in the liberal international order.
            (9) The United States counters attempts by the PRC to--
                    (A) undermine open and democratic societies;
                    (B) distort global markets;
                    (C) manipulate the international trade system;
                    (D) coerce other nations via economic, cyber, and 
                military means; or
                    (E) use its technological advantages to undermine 
                individual freedoms or other states' national security 
                interests.
            (10) The United States deters military confrontation with 
        the PRC and both nations work to reduce the risk of conflict.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States, in pursuit of 
the objectives set forth in subsection (a)--
            (1) to strengthen the United States domestic foundation by 
        reinvesting in market-based economic growth, education, 
        scientific and technological innovation, democratic 
        institutions, and other areas that improve the ability of the 
        United States to pursue its vital economic, foreign policy, and 
        national security interests;
            (2) to pursue a strategy of strategic competition with the 
        PRC in the political, diplomatic, economic, development, 
        security, informational, and technological realms to maximize 
        the United States' strengths and increase the costs for the PRC 
        of harming the interests and values of the United States and 
        its partners and allies;
            (3) to lead a free, open, and secure international system 
        characterized by the rule of law, open markets and the free 
        flow of commerce, and a shared commitment to security and 
        peaceful resolution of disputes, human rights, good and 
        transparent governance, and freedom from coercion;
            (4) to strengthen and deepen United States alliances and 
        partnerships by pursuing greater bilateral and multilateral 
        cooperative initiatives that advance shared interests and 
        values and bolster partner countries' confidence that the 
        United States is and will remain a strong, committed, and 
        reliable partner that respects the views and interests of its 
        allies and friends;
            (5) to encourage and collaborate with United States allies 
        and partners in boosting their own capabilities and resiliency 
        to pursue, defend, and protect shared interests and values, 
        free from coercion and external pressure;
            (6) to pursue fair, reciprocal treatment and healthy, 
        constructive competition in United States-China economic 
        relations by--
                    (A) advancing policies that harden the United 
                States economy against unfair and illegal commercial or 
                trading practices and the coercion of United States 
                businesses; and

        Indo-Pacific will require the United States--
                    (A) to marshal sustained political will to protect 
                its vital interests, promote its values, and advance

                persuade the American people and United States allies 
                and partners of--
                            (i) the current challenges facing the

                        values.
            (2) The United States must coordinate closely with allies 
        and partners to compete effectively with the PRC, including to 
        encourage allies and partners to assume, as appropriate, 
        greater roles in balancing and checking aggressive PRC 
        behavior.
            (3) Effective United States strategy toward China

                collaboration and consultation between the executive

        economic and foreign policymakers and provide support to the 
        private sector, civil society, universities and academic 
        institutions, and other relevant actors in free and open 
        societies to enable such actors--
                    (A) to collaborate to advance common interests; and

                        free and open order.
            (5) The United States must ensure that all Federal 
        departments, agencies, and overseas missions are organized and 
        resourced to effectively defend and advance United States 
        interests, by--
                    (A) dedicating more personnel in the Indo-Pacific

            (6) The United States must place renewed priority and 
        emphasis on strengthening the nonmilitary instruments of 
        national power, including diplomacy, information, technology, 
        economics, foreign assistance and development finance, 
        commerce, intelligence, and law enforcement, which are crucial 
        for addressing the challenges posed by the PRC.

        effectively--
                    (A) promote the value of partnership with the 
                United States; and

             Subtitle C--Economic Diplomacy and Leadership

SEC. 121. FINDINGS ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States played a leadership role in 
        constructing the architecture, rules, and norms governing the 
        international economic order following the Second World War, 
        yielding decades of domestic economic and geopolitical 
        prosperity and stability.
            (2) In 2017, the United States withdrew from the Trans-
        Pacific Partnership (TPP), an economic pact that was negotiated 
        by 12 countries that covered 40 percent of the world economy, 
        leading the 11 remaining Asia-Pacific countries to sign the 
        Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific 
        Partnership (CPTPP) the following year, setting high-standard 
        rules for regional economic engagement.
            (3) In 2020, the 10 countries of the Association of 
        Southeast Asian Nations along with South Korea, China, Japan, 
        Australia, and New Zealand signed the Regional Comprehensive 
        Economic Partnership (RCEP), the world's biggest trade deal in 
        terms of GDP.
            (4) Reduced United States economic engagement has led 
        United States allies and partners to question the United 
        States' commitment to the Indo-Pacific region. Despite its 
        distortive and unfair trade practices, the People's Republic of 
        China is taking advantage of this vacuum by deepening its 
        partnerships in the region and promoting its own state-led 
        economic model.
            (5) The United States is increasingly on the outside 
        looking in with regards to economic pacts in the Indo-Pacific. 
        United States absence from these agreements puts it at both a 
        strategic and competitive disadvantage in the region and allows 
        competitors to expand their economic influence at the United 
        States' expense.
            (6) Given that these partnerships and agreements will 
        define the rules and norms that will govern regional commerce 
        over the coming decades, the United States is currently not 
        well positioned to shape the coming economic landscape.
            (7) It is in the United States' vital interest to upgrade 
        its economic engagement and leadership in the Indo-Pacific and 
        develop concrete steps to strengthen its commercial diplomacy 
        to fully participle in the region's economic dynamism.

                globally, both agreements it has signed or entered into

                countries or groups of countries;
                    (C) detail the other mechanisms the PRC uses to 
                advance its international economic objectives, 
                including economic and commercial dialogues and BRI 
                related activities;
                    (D) compare the United States and Chinese 
                approaches and priorities on trade and investment with 
                major global economies, United States allies, and for 
                each region of the world; and
                    (E) outline what further steps the PRC may take in 
                the Indo-Pacific region to bolster its economic 
                position and influence.
            (2) An evaluation of the impacts of the PRC's trade and 
        investment policies, including--
                    (A) the impact of these trade and investment 
                agreements on the PRC's economy, with a focus on its 
                trade and investment profile, the impact on the PRC's 
                economic growth and per-capita income, and the impact 
                on the profitability and market share of Chinese 
                companies and SOEs;
                    (B) the impact of these agreements on the PRC's 
                political and diplomatic relations with the countries 
                it entered into agreements with and by region; and
                    (C) the impact of the PRC's trade and investment 
                relationships with other countries on the market share 
                of United States companies.

        region's economic architecture.
            (3) Work to ensure that the United States absence from the 
        Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific 
        Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership 
        do not undermine the United States' ability to shape regional 
        trade and investment rules.
            (4) Working with allies and partners to build resilient and 
        trusted supply chains especially for critical and emerging 
        technologies, including semiconductors, and products and 
        components critical for national health, including vaccines and

SEC. 124. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED TO BOLSTER AMERICAN LEADERSHIP 
              IN THE ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States has benefitted from the regional 
        economic integration agenda of the Asia Pacific Economic 
        Cooperation (APEC) forum since its inception in 1989;
            (2) APEC is a hub of trade and commerce for 21 member 
        economies that, as of 2018, accounted for 60 percent of global 
        GDP and 48 percent of global trade;
            (3) APEC has contributed to the reduction in trade 
        barriers, harmonization of regulations, and enhanced access to 
        global value chains, while raising the profile of critical 
        topics such as fair trade, sustainability, gender parity, and 
        inclusive growth;
            (4) it is in the United States interest to engage and lead 
        at APEC to push for an open and inclusive regional economy that 
        benefits United States workers, consumers, and businesses and 
        better integrates the United States economy with others in the 
        region;
            (5) when the United States last hosted APEC in 2011, it was 
        able to promote United States interests, while reassuring 
        allies and partners about its strong commitment to the region 
        in the economic arena;
            (6) today, APEC can again be used as a forum to make 
        progress on several United States priorities, that are shared 
        by United States allies and partners, including--
                    (A) making regional commerce more inclusive;
                    (B) fostering innovation and digitization; and
                    (C) addressing climate change and environmental 
                protection;
            (7) hosting APEC would provide a tremendous opportunity to 
        leverage American leadership to shape the regional economic 
        agenda;
            (8) hosting APEC would allow the United States to advance 
        several of its own priorities in the region, including to--
                    (A) expand the participation of APEC stakeholders 
                to include labor groups, environmental advocates, and 
                other part of civil society;
                    (B) upgrade APEC's work to empower and promote 
                small and medium enterprises;
                    (C) spotlight best practices and plans to upgrade 
                skills for the next-generation of technology jobs;
                    (D) advance a climate and sustainable trade and 
                development agenda with a focus on green technologies, 
                infrastructure and finance; and
                    (E) advance work on digital trade, including by 
                expanding rules on data privacy, promoting digital 
                inclusiveness and promoting the free flow of data; and
            (9) with no host confirmed for 2023, the United States 
        should immediately announce its interest to host APEC in 2023 
        and work with the APEC Secretariat and like-minded APEC members 
        to build support.

SEC. 126. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ISSUES.

    (a) Leadership in International Standards Setting.--It is the sense 
of Congress that the United States must lead in international bodies 
that set the governance norms and rules for critical digitally enabled 
technologies in order to ensure that these technologies operate within 
a free, secure, interoperable, and stable digital domain.
    (b) Countering Digital Authoritarianism.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States, along with allies and partners, should 
lead an international effort that uses all of the economic and 
diplomatic tools at its disposal to combat the expanding use of 
information and communications technology products and services to 
surveil, repress, and manipulate populations (also known as ``digital 
authoritarianism'').
    (c) Freedom of Information in the Digital Age.--It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should lead a global effort to ensure 
that freedom of information, including the ability to safely consume or 
publish information without fear of undue reprisals, is maintained as 
the digital domain becomes an increasingly integral mechanism for 
communication.
    (d) Efforts to Ensure Technological Development Does Not Threaten 
Democratic Governance or Human Rights.--It is the sense of Congress 
that the United States should lead a global effort to develop and adopt 
a set of common principles and standards for critical technologies to 
ensure that the use of such technologies cannot be abused by malign 
actors, whether they are governments or other entities, and that they 
do not threaten democratic governance or human rights.

SEC. 127. DIGITAL TRADE AGREEMENTS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) as the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated United States 
        dependence on digital tools, international rules around digital 
        governance and trade have remained largely piecemeal;
            (2) the People's Republic of China is operating under and 
        advancing a set of digital rules that are contrary to United 
        States values and interests, and those of United States allies 
        and partners;
            (3) a patchwork of plurilateral, trilateral, and bilateral 
        digital trade agreements, including the Comprehensive and 
        Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 
        Singapore-Australia Digital Trade Agreement, and the Singapore-
        New Zealand-Chile Digital Economy Partnership Agreement have 
        emerged, creating a set of rules that the United States should 
        be driving;
            (4) the United States has already underscored the need for 
        such agreements by signing the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade 
        Agreement in October 2019 and including a robust digital trade 
        or e-commerce chapter in the United States-Mexico-Canada 
        Agreement;
            (5) a regional deal on digital governance and trade would 
        allow the United States to unite a group of like-minded 
        economies around common standards and norms, including the 
        principles of openness, inclusiveness, fairness, transparency, 
        and the free flow of data with trust, that are increasingly 
        vital for the global economy;
            (6) such an agreement would facilitate the creation of 
        common rules and standards that govern cross-border data flows, 
        the protection of privacy, and cybersecurity at a time of 
        growing digital vulnerabilities for individuals, businesses, 
        and institutions around the world;
            (7) such an agreement would facilitate the participation of 
        small and medium-sized enterprises in the global economy 
        through trade facilitation measures, including e-marketing, e-
        invoicing and e-payment; and
            (8) the United States Trade Representative, in consultation 
        with the Secretary of State should negotiate bilateral and 
        plurilateral agreements or arrangements relating to digital 
        trade with the like-minded countries in the Indo-Pacific 
        region, the European Union, the member countries of the Five 
        Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance, and other partners and 
        allies, as appropriate.

        rights violations;
            (5) bolster the role of civil society in informing ICT

SEC. 129. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IDEOLOGICAL COMPETITION.

    It is the sense of Congress that National Security Advisor Jake 
Sullivan correctly observed that the United States and likeminded 
democracies are in an ideological competition with the People's 
Republic of China, under the direction and control of the Chinese 
Communist Party, when he stated, ``China is essentially making the case 
that the Chinese model is better than the American model. . . This is 
not any longer some kind of implied contrast. It is an explicit 
statement that there is an alternative model to the democratic market 
economy model that the United States has been advancing over the course 
of decades.''.

             Subtitle D--Financial Diplomacy and Leadership

SEC. 131. FINDINGS ON CHINESE FINANCIAL INDUSTRIAL POLICY.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China operates a system of 
        state-owned financial institutions including retail banks, 
        investment banks, asset managers, and insurers which are given 
        favorable treatment under Chinese law while foreign financial 
        institutions have strict restrictions on their ability to 
        operate in the PRC.
            (2) In order to join the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 
        2001, the PRC Government committed to opening the credit card 
        payment business to foreign firms by 2006.
            (3) After years of the PRC refusing to open its payment 
        market, the United States brought a case against the PRC before 
        the WTO. In 2012, the WTO mandated that the PRC open its card 
        payment market to global competitors.
            (4) Even after the WTO's ruling, the PRC Government refused 
        to comply with the ruling and maintained a rule that required 
        all yuan-denominated payment cards to use the PRC's Union Pay 
        network. Only in 2020, after the Chinese payment market had 
        grown to $27 trillion, did the PRC Government approve the 
        application of foreign firms to enter the market.
            (5) The PRC continues to maintain aggressive capital 
        controls, limiting access to the Chinese market to foreign 
        investors while hamstringing its own citizens ability to 
        control their money.
            (6) On November 5, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping 
        announced that the PRC would launch a technology innovation 
        stock exchange. The Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR Market 
        launched on July 22, 2019.
            (7) On October 24, 2020, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma 
        referred to ``pawnshop mentality'' of state-owned banks. 
        Shortly thereafter, the initial public offering of his firm Ant 
        Financial was canceled by Chinese regulators.
            (8) The PRC Government is pioneering the use of a fully 
        digitized yuan, which is set to be the world's first central 
        bank backed digital currency, and the People's Bank of China 
        and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority have already begun testing 
        the cross-border functionality of the digital currency.

SEC. 132. REPORT ON IMPORTANCE OF AMERICAN FINANCIAL STRENGTH FOR 
              GLOBAL LEADERSHIP.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the dominance of the dollar as the global reserve 
        currency has yielded significant benefits to the United States 
        and the American people by allowing the United States to 
        maintain economic independence, better control its monetary 
        policy, and finance government outlays;
            (2) American global leadership has benefited from the 
        United States monetary stability, creditworthiness, deep 
        capital markets, and financial technology innovations;
            (3) effective diplomacy and safeguarding of American 
        national security rely on the United States role as the global 
        financial leader, hub of global trade, and source of economic 
        opportunity;
            (4) by cracking down on dissent in the key financial center 
        of Hong Kong, driving the creation of a technology focused 
        stock exchange, and pushing forward a Central Bank digital 
        currency, the People's Republic of China is attempting to 
        become the leading hub of finance in the world; and
            (5) the United States must maintain its position as a 
        global financial leader to continue its broader global 
        leadership role around the world.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit to the appropriate committees 
of Congress a report that--
            (1) lists and examines the benefits to American foreign 
        policy that derive from the United States financial leadership 
        and the dollar's status as the world's global reserve currency;
            (2) describes the actions taken by the People's Republic of 
        China that could cement China's role as the world's leading 
        financial center;
            (3) analyzes the possible impact on American national 
        security and foreign policy were the yuan to supplant the 
        dollar as the world's leading reserve currency;
            (4) outlines how the United States can work diplomatically 
        with allies, partners, and other nations to preserve a 
        financial system that is free, open, and fair; and
            (5) identifies steps the United States can take to preserve 
        its status as the world's leading financial center and maintain 
        the dollar's position as the global reserve currency.
    (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives;
            (2) the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
        Representatives;
            (3) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and
            (4) the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of 
        the Senate.

SEC. 133. REVIEW OF CHINESE COMPANIES ON UNITED STATES CAPITAL MARKETS.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) Beginning in the 1990s, a wave of Chinese companies 
        sought to raise capital and list shares on American stock 
        markets.
            (2) In 2011 and 2012, more than 100 Chinese firms were 
        delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as a result of fraud, 
        accounting scandals, and other corporate governance failures.
            (3) Following extensive diplomatic efforts by the United 
        States Government, the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
        Board (PCAOB) signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
        China Securities Regulatory Commission and the China Ministry 
        of Finance for the production and exchange of audit documents.
            (4) Despite signing the agreement, Chinese regulators 
        continue to hinder the PCAOB's access to relevant documents 
        that are necessary for the PCAOB to carry out its enforcement 
        duties.
            (5) In August 2020, the Department of State sent a letter 
        to American universities warning about national security 
        implications related to Chinese stock holdings.
            (6) In December 2020, Congress passed and the President 
        signed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (Public 
        Law 116-222), which requires foreign companies listed on 
        American stock markets to comply with PCAOB auditing rules 
        within three years. Under the legislation, issuers not in 
        compliance within three years will be delisted.
    (b) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees a report that 
        describes the costs and benefits to the United States posed by 
        the presence of companies incorporated in the People's Republic 
        of China (PRC) that are listed on American stock exchanges or 
        traded over the counter, in the form of American depository 
        receipts.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The report shall--
                    (A) identify companies incorporated in the PRC 
                that--
                            (i) are listed or traded on one or several 
                        stock exchanges within the United States, 
                        including over-the-counter market and ``A 
                        Shares'' added to indexes and exchange-traded 
                        funds out of mainland exchanges in the PRC; and
                            (ii) based on the factors for consideration 
                        described in paragraph (3), have knowingly and 
                        materially contributed to--
                                    (I) activities that undermine 
                                United States national security;
                                    (II) serious abuses of 
                                internationally recognized human 
                                rights; or
                                    (III) a substantially increased 
                                financial risk exposure for United 
                                States-based investors;
                    (B) describe the activities of the companies 
                identified pursuant to subparagraph (A), and their 
                implications for the United States; and
                    (C) develop policy recommendations for the United 
                States Government, State governments, United States 
                financial institutions, United States equity and debt 
                exchanges, and other relevant stakeholders to address 
                the risks posed by the presence in United States 
                capital markets of the companies identified pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A).
            (3) Factors for inclusion of a company.--In completing the 
        report under paragraph (1), the President shall consider 
        whether a company should be identified pursuant to paragraph 
        (2)(A) because the company has--
                    (A) materially contributed to the development or 
                manufacture, or sold or facilitated procurement by the 
                PLA, of lethal military equipment or component parts of 
                such equipment;
                    (B) contributed to the construction and

                missile technology in violation of United Nations 
                Security Council resolutions or United States 
                sanctions;
                    (G) contributed to the repression of religious and 
                ethnic minorities within the PRC, including in Xinjiang 
                Uyghur Autonomous Region or Tibet Autonomous Region;
                    (H) contributed to the development of technologies 
                that enable censorship directed or directly supported 
                by the Government of the PRC; or

                determined to be relevant by the President.
            (4) Factors for making policy recommendations.--In

        weigh the national security implications and consider the 
        following factors identified pursuant to paragraph (3) (except 
        that such report should exclude from its analysis the delisting 
        or potential delisting of companies from United States markets

                    (A) The possibility that banning or delisting

                companies from United States markets could impact the 
                status of the United States as the world's leading 
                capital markets center, particularly vis-a-vis the PRC.
                    (C) The impact on American foreign policy and

              CROSS-BORDER PAYMENT AND FINANCIAL MESSAGING SYSTEMS.

    (a) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the

            (2) Matters to be included.--The report required under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) assess the extent to which American diplomacy 
                and global leadership hinge upon the current 
                infrastructure and existing ecosystem of cross-border 
                payment and financial messaging systems;
                    (B) examine the durability of the Society for 
                Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication 
                cooperative;
                    (C) review and analyze ways in which the Cross 
                Border Interbank Payment Systems, cryptocurrencies, and 
                central bank digital currencies could erode this 
                system; and
                    (D) analyze how changes to global cross-border 
                payment systems could undermine United States national 
                security interests including impacts on the efficacy of 
                sanctions, the countering of terrorist finance, and the

SEC. 202. UNITED STATES COMMITMENT AND SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
              IN THE INDO-PACIFIC.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States treaty alliances in the Indo-Pacific 
        provide a unique strategic advantage to the United States and 
        are among the Nation's most precious assets, enabling the 
        United States to advance its vital national interests, defend 
        its territory, expand its economy through international trade 
        and commerce, establish enduring cooperation with allies while 
        seeking to establish new partnerships, prevent the domination 
        of the Indo-Pacific and its surrounding maritime and air lanes 
        by a hostile power or powers, and deter potential aggressors;
            (2) the Governments of the United States, Japan, South 
        Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand are critical 
        allies in advancing a free and open order in the Indo-Pacific 
        region and tackling challenges with unity of purpose, and have 
        collaborated to advance specific efforts of shared interest in 
        areas such as defense and security, economic prosperity, 
        infrastructure connectivity, and fundamental freedoms;
            (3) the United States greatly values other partnerships in 
        the Indo-Pacific region, including with India, Singapore, 
        Indonesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam, as well as its 
        trilateral and quadrilateral dialogues, and regional 
        architecture such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
        (ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, which are 
        essential to further shared interests;
            (4) the security environment in the Indo-Pacific demands 
        consistent United States and allied commitment to strengthening 
        and advancing alliances so that they are postured to meet these 
        challenges, and will require sustained political will, concrete 
        partnerships, economic, commercial, technological, and security 
        cooperation, consistent and tangible commitments, high-level 
        and extensive consultations on matters of mutual interest, 
        mutual and shared cooperation in the acquisition of key 
        capabilities important to allied defenses, and unified mutual 
        support in the face of political, economic, or military 
        coercion;
            (5) fissures in the United States alliance relationships 
        and partnerships benefit United States adversaries and weaken 
        the collective ability to advance shared interests;
            (6) the United States must work with allies to prioritize 
        human rights throughout the Indo-Pacific region;
            (7) as the report released in August 2020 by the Expert 
        Group of the International Military Council on Climate and 
        Security (IMCCS), entitled ``Climate and Security in the Indo-
        Asia Pacific'' noted, the Indo-Pacific region is one of the 
        regions most vulnerable to climate impacts, and as former 
        Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and 
        Environment Sherri Goodman, Secretary General of IMCCS, noted, 
        climate shocks act as a threat multiplier in the Indo-Pacific 
        region, increasing humanitarian response costs and impacting 
        security throughout the region as sea levels rise, fishing 
        patterns shift, food insecurity rises, and storms grow stronger 
        and more frequent;
            (8) the United State should continue to engage on and 
        deepen cooperation with allies and partners of the United 
        States in the Indo-Pacific region, as laid out in the Asia 
        Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115-409), in the areas 
        of--
                    (A) forecasting environmental challenges;
                    (B) assisting with transnational cooperation on 
                sustainable uses of forest and water resources with the 
                goal of preserving biodiversity and access to safe 
                drinking water;
                    (C) fisheries and marine resource conservation; and
                    (D) meeting environmental challenges and developing 
                resilience;
            (9) the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the United States 
        Agency for International Development, should facilitate a 
        robust interagency Indo-Pacific climate resiliency and 
        adaptation strategy focusing on internal and external actions 
        needed--
                    (A) to facilitate regional early recovery, risk 
                reduction, and resilience to weather-related impacts on 
                strategic interests of the United States and partners 
                and allies of the United States in the region; and
                    (B) to address humanitarian and food security 
                impacts of weather-related changes in the region; and
            (10) ASEAN centrality and ASEAN-led mechanisms remain 
        essential to the evolving institutional architecture of the 
        Indo-Pacific region.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States--
            (1) to deepen diplomatic, economic, and security 
        cooperation with and among United States allies in the Indo-
        Pacific, as appropriate, including through diplomatic 
        engagement, regional development, energy security and 
        development, scientific and health partnerships, educational 
        and cultural exchanges, intelligence-sharing, and other 
        diplomatic and defense-related initiatives;

                subsequent bilateral security agreements and 
                arrangements concluded on or before the date of

                    (D) defending Thailand consistent with the

                understanding thereto the Thanat-Rusk communique of 
                1962, and all related and subsequent bilateral security 
                agreements and arrangements concluded on or before the

                    (E) defending Australia consistent with the 
                Security Treaty Between Australia and the United States 
                of America, done at San Francisco, September 1, 1951, 
                and all related and subsequent bilateral security 
                agreements and arrangements concluded on or before the 
                date of enactment of this Act;

            (4) to cooperate with allies and partners to promote human 
        rights across the Indo-Pacific region bilaterally and through 
        regional and multilateral fora and pacts;
            (5) to strengthen and advance diplomatic, economic, and

        Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, whose governments 
        comprise the Mekong River Commission (MRC). United States 
        efforts should focus on increasing MRC member countries' 
        capacity in the sustainable conservation and management of

SEC. 203. BOOSTING QUAD COOPERATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) as a Pacific power, the United States should continue 
        to strengthen its cooperation with Australia, India, and Japan, 
        (commonly referred to as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or 
        ``Quad'') to enhance and implement a shared vision to meet 
        regional challenges and to promote a free, open, inclusive, 
        resilient, and healthy Indo-Pacific, characterized by respect 
        for democratic norms, rule of law, and market-driven economic 
        growth, and that is free from undue influence and coercion;
            (2) the United States should expand dialogue and 
        cooperation through the Quad with a range of partners to 
        support the rule of law, freedom of navigation and overflight, 
        peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, and 
        territorial integrity, and to uphold peace and prosperity and 
        strengthen democratic resilience in the Indo-Pacific;
            (3) the recent pledge from the first-ever Quad leaders 
        meeting on March 12, 2021, to respond to the economic and 
        health impacts of COVID-19, including expanding safe, 
        affordable, and effective vaccine production and equitable 
        access, and to address shared challenges, including in 
        cyberspace, critical technologies, counterterrorism, quality 
        infrastructure investment, and humanitarian assistance and 
        disaster relief, as well as maritime domains, further advances 
        the important cooperation among Quad nations that is so 
        critical to the Indo-Pacific region;
            (4) building upon their announced commitment to finance 
        1,000,000,000 or more COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for 
        use in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States International 
        Development Finance Corporation, the Japan International 
        Cooperation Agency, and the Japan Bank for International 
        Cooperation, including through partnerships other multilateral 
        development banks, should also venture to finance development 
        and infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region that are 
        competitive, transparent, and sustainable;
            (5) the United States should participate in the Resilient 
        Supply Chain Initiative launched by Australia, Japan, and India 
        in 2020, along with similar initiatives that relocate supply 
        chains in the health, economic, and national security sectors 
        to the United States, its Quad partners, and other like-minded 
        countries; and
            (6) the formation of a Quad Intra-Parliamentary Working 
        Group could--
                    (A) sustain and deepen engagement between senior 
                officials of the Quad countries on a full spectrum of 
                issues; and
                    (B) be modeled on the successful and long-standing 
                bilateral intra-parliamentary groups between the United 
                States and Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as 
                well as other formal and informal parliamentary 
                exchanges.

SEC. 209. TAIWAN DIPLOMATIC REVIEW.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Pursuant to the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 
        3301(b)(1)), it is the policy of the United States to ``promote 
        extensive, close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other 
        relations between the people of the United States and the 
        people of Taiwan''.
            (2) In May 2019, the Taiwanese counterpart to the American 
        Institute in Taiwan, the Coordination Council for North 
        American Affairs, was renamed the ``Taiwan Council for U.S. 
        Affairs''.
            (3) It is the policy of the United States to refer to 
        Taiwan as ``Taiwan'', not ``Taipei'' or ``Chinese Taipei''.
            (4) The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office 
        is inaptly named as it works to cultivate the extensive, close, 
        and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between 
        the people of the United States and the people, organizations, 
        and enterprises of Taiwan, not merely those in Taipei.
    (b) Negotiations to Rename Tecro.--Reflective of the substantively 
deepening ties between Taiwan and the United States, the Secretary of 
State shall seek to enter into negotiations with appropriate officials 
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United 
States with the objective of renaming its office in Washington, D.C., 
the Taiwan Representative Office in the United States, and its 
subsidiary offices in the United States, accordingly.

            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
                of Representatives; and
                    (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
                Senate.

        organization'' includes United Nations funds, programs, 
        specialized agencies, entities, and bodies, as well as other 
        organizations outside of the United Nations system that the 
        Secretary of State determines appropriate, in consultation with 
        other relevant Federal departments and agencies.
            (3) One-china principle.--The term ``One-China Principle'' 
        means only the PRC's policy toward Taiwan.
            (4) Civil society organizations.--The term ``civil society 
        organizations'' means international civil society organizations 
        that are critical to maintaining Taiwan's international space 
        and enabling Taiwan to play a positive and constructive role in 
        the global community.
            (5) Potential pla campaigns.--The term ``potential PLA 
        campaigns'' means--
                    (A) a naval blockade of Taiwan;
                    (B) an amphibious assault and ground invasion of 
                Taiwan, especially such invasion designed to accomplish 
                a fiat accompli before intervention is possible; or
                    (C) a seizure of one or more of Taiwan's outlying 
                islands.
    (c) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States has consistently sought to advance 
        peace and stability in East Asia as a central element of United 
        States foreign policy toward the region.
            (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), 
        especially since the election of Tsai Ing-Wen in 2016, has 
        conducted a coordinated campaign to weaken Taiwan 
        diplomatically, economically, and militarily in a manner that 
        threatens to erode United States policy and create a fait 
        accompli on questions surrounding Taiwan's future.
            (3) In order to ensure the longevity of United States 
        policy and preserve the ability of the people of Taiwan to 
        determine their future independently, it is necessary to 
        reinforce Taiwan's diplomatic, economic, and physical space.
            (4) Taiwan has provided monetary, humanitarian, and medical 
        assistance to combat diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis, 
        Ebola, and dengue fever in countries around the world. During 
        the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan donated millions of pieces of 
        personal protective equipment and COVID-19 tests to countries 
        in need.
            (5) Since 2016, the Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama, 
        the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the Solomon 
        Islands, and Kiribati have severed diplomatic relations with 
        Taiwan in favor of diplomatic relations with China.
            (6) Taiwan was invited to participate in the World Health 
        Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health 
        Organization, as an observer annually between 2009 and 2016. 
        Since the 2016 election of President Tsai, the PRC has 
        increasingly resisted Taiwan's participation in the WHA. Taiwan 
        was not invited to attend the WHA in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, or 
        2021.
            (7) The Taipei Flight Information Region reportedly served 
        1,750,000 flights and 68,900,000 passengers in 2018 and is home 
        to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, the 11th busiest 
        airport in the world. Taiwan has been excluded from 
        participating at the International Civil Aviation Organization 
        since 2013.
            (8) United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 (1971) 
        does not address the issue of representation of Taiwan and its 
        people at the United Nations, nor does it give the PRC the 
        right to represent the people on Taiwan.
    (d) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
to--
            (1) maintain the position that peace and stability in the 
        Western Pacific are in the political, security, and economic 
        interests of the United States, and are matters of 
        international concern; and
            (2) work with allies and partners to promote peace and 
        stability in the Indo-Pacific and deter military acts or other 
        forms of coercive behavior that would undermine regional 
        stability.
    (e) Sense of Congress on Taiwan's Meaningful Participation in the 
International Community.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Taiwan is free, democratic, and prosperous, is home to 
        23,500,000 people, and is an important contributor to the 
        global community;
            (2) multiple United States Government Administrations have 
        taken important steps to advance Taiwan's meaningful 
        participation in international organizations and to enhance 
        cooperation with Taiwan to provide global public goods, 
        including through development assistance, humanitarian 
        assistance, and disaster relief in trilateral and multilateral 
        fora;
            (3) nonetheless, significant structural, policy, and legal 
        barriers remain to advancing Taiwan's meaningful participation 
        in the international community; and
            (4) efforts to share Taiwan's expertise with other parts of 
        the global community could be further enhanced through a 
        systematic approach, along with greater attention from Congress 
        and the American public to such efforts.
    (f) Strategy to Support Taiwan's Meaningful Participation in 
International Organizations.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this section, the Secretary of State, in

        committees a strategy--
                    (A) to advance Taiwan's meaningful participation in

                    (B) that responds to growing pressure from the PRC 
                on foreign governments, international organizations, 
                commercial actors, and civil society organizations to 
                comply with its ``One-China Principle'' with respect to 
                Taiwan.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The strategy required under 
        paragraph (1) shall include--
                    (A) an assessment of the methods the PRC uses to 
                coerce actors to into adhering to its ``One-China 
                Principle'', including those employed against 
                governments, international organizations, and civil 
                society organizations and pressure on commercial 
                actors, to the extent relevant in the context of 
                Taiwan's meaningful participation international 
                organizations;
                    (B) an assessment of the policies of foreign 
                governments toward the PRC and Taiwan, to identify 
                likeminded allies and partners who might become public 
                or private partners in the strategy;
                    (C) a systematic analysis of all international 
                organizations, as practicable, to identify those that 
                best lend themselves to advancing Taiwan's 
                participation, including--
                            (i) the organization's policy on the 
                        requirements to obtain membership and observer 
                        status, as well as the foundational documents

                        rules;
                            (iii) the processes for developing 
                        membership requirements and participation 
                        rules;
                            (iv) the policies of current members 
                        regarding Taiwan's political status; and
                            (v) the organization's relative reliance on 
                        contributions from the PRC and how it may 
                        affect internal decision-making;
                    (D) an evaluation of the feasibility and

                have allowed Taiwan's meaningful participation, 
                including an assessment of whether any erosion in 
                Taiwan's engagement has occurred within those 
                organizations and how Taiwan's participation has 
                positively strengthened the capacity and activity of 
                these organizations, providing positive models for 
                Taiwan's inclusion in other similar forums;
                    (F) a list of not more than 20 international

        the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the United 
        States Agency for International Development (USAID), in

                            (ii) volume of current cooperation 
                        initiatives and barriers to expanding it;

                        expanding cooperation facing the United States 
                        or Taiwan; and
                            (v) geopolitical barriers that complicate 
                        United States-Taiwan cooperation in third 
                        countries.
                    (E) Recommendations to address the challenges 
                identified in subparagraph (D).
                    (F) A description of any additional resources or 
                authorities that expanding cooperation might require.
            (3) Form.--The strategy required in paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified 
        annex.
    (h) Sense of Congress on Expanding United States Economic Relations 
With Taiwan.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) expanding United States economic relations with Taiwan 
        has benefited the people of both the United States and Taiwan; 
        and
            (2) the United States should explore opportunities to 
        deepen, and where possible expand, economic ties between Taiwan 
        and the United States, through dialogue, and by developing the 
        legal templates required to support potential future 
        agreements.
    (i) Sense of Congress on Peace and Stability in the Taiwan 
Strait.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) PRC attempts to intimidate Taiwan, including through 
        high rates of PRC sorties into air space near Taiwan, and PRC 
        amphibious assault exercises near Taiwan, jeopardizes the long-
        standing United States position that differences in cross-
        Strait relations must be resolved peacefully;
            (2) given the potential for a cross-Strait conflict to be 
        highly destructive and destabilizing, any increase in the risk 
        of conflict demands attention and obligates leaders to 
        reinforce deterrence, as the most viable means to prevent war;
            (3) Taiwan should continue to implement its asymmetric 
        defense strategy, including investing in cost-effective and 
        resilient capabilities, while also strengthening recruitment 
        and training of its reserve and civil defense forces, and those 
        capabilities include, but are not limited to, coastal defense 
        cruise missiles; and
            (4) while enhancing deterrence, it is also essential to 
        maintain open and effective crisis communication and risk 
        reduction mechanisms, as a means to reduce the risk of 
        misunderstanding and ultimately, conflict.
    (j) Strategy to Enhance Deterrence Over a Cross-strait Conflict.--
            (1) In general.--No later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a whole-of-government 
        strategy to enhance deterrence over a cross-Strait military 
        conflict between the PRC and Taiwan.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The strategy shall include the 
        following:
                    (A) A comprehensive review of existing diplomatic, 
                economic, and military tools to establish deterrence 
                over a cross-Strait conflict and an assessment of their 
                efficacy.
                    (B) An examination of the present and future 
                capabilities of the United States and Taiwan to respond 
                to the potential PLA campaigns against Taiwan in 5, 10, 
                and 15 years. The analysis shall include an assessment 
                of the progress Taiwan has made in developing the cost-
                effective and resilient capabilities needed to respond 
                to its strategic environment, as well as any additional 
                personnel, procurement, or training reforms required.
                    (C) An evaluation of the feasibility of expanding 
                coordination with United States allies and partners to 
                enhance deterrence over a cross-Strait conflict. The

                        private messaging on deterrence vis-a-vis 
                        Taiwan.
                            (ii) Coordinating use of economic tools to 
                        raise the costs of PRC military action that 
                        could precipitate a cross-Strait conflict.
                            (iii) Enhancing codevelopment and 
                        codeployment of military capabilities related 
                        to deterrence over a cross-Strait conflict, or 
                        enhancing coordination on training of Taiwan's 
                        military forces.
                    (D) Recommendations on significant additional 
                diplomatic, economic, and military steps available to 
                the United States Government, unilaterally and in 
                concert with United States allies and partners, to 
                enhance the clarity and credibility of deterrence over 
                a cross-Strait conflict.
                    (E) A description of any additional resources or 
                authorities needed to implement the recommendations 
                identified in subparagraph (D).
            (3) Form.--The strategy required in paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted classified form but may include an unclassified 
        annex.
            (4) Consultation.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and not less frequently than every 180 
        days thereafter for 7 years, the President (or a designee), as 
        well as representatives from the agencies and departments 
        involved in developing the strategy required in paragraph (1), 
        shall consult with the appropriate congressional committees 
        regarding the development and implementation of the strategy 
        required in this subsection. The representatives from the 
        relevant agencies and departments shall be at the Under

        strengthening the community of civilian defense professionals 
        in Taiwan, facilitated through the American Institute in Taiwan 
        as appropriate.
            (2) Matters to be included.--The plan required by paragraph 
        (1) shall include the following:
                    (A) A comprehensive review of existing United 
                States Government and non-United States Government 
                programmatic and funding modalities to support Taiwan's 
                civilian defense professionals in pursuing professional 
                development, educational, and cultural exchanges in the 
                United States, including--
                            (i) opportunities through Department of 
                        State-supported programs, such as the

SEC. 212. TAIWAN FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Taiwan 
Fellowship Act''.
    (b) Findings; Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) The Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 
                U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) affirmed United States policy ``to 
                preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly 
                commercial, cultural, and other relations between the 
                people of the United States and the people on Taiwan, 
                as well as the people on the China mainland and all 
                other peoples of the Western Pacific area''.
                    (B) Consistent with the Asia Reassurance Initiative 
                Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409), the United States has 
                grown its strategic partnership with Taiwan's vibrant 
                democracy of 23,000,000 people.
                    (C) Despite a concerted campaign by the People's 
                Republic of China to isolate Taiwan from its diplomatic 
                partners and from international organizations, 
                including the World Health Organization, Taiwan has 
                emerged as a global leader in the coronavirus global 
                pandemic response, including by donating more than 
                2,000,000 surgical masks and other medical equipment to 
                the United States.
                    (D) The creation of a United States fellowship 
                program with Taiwan would support--
                            (i) a key priority of expanding people-to-
                        people exchanges, which was outlined in 
                        President Donald J. Trump's 2017 National 
                        Security Strategy;
                            (ii) President Joseph R. Biden's commitment 
                        to Taiwan, ``a leading democracy and a critical 
                        economic and security partner'', as expressed 
                        in his March 2021 Interim National Security 
                        Strategic Guidance; and
                            (iii) April 2021 guidance from the 
                        Department of State based on a review required 
                        under the Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 
                        (subtitle B of title III of division FF of 
                        Public Law 116-260) to ``encourage U.S. 
                        government engagement with Taiwan that reflects 
                        our deepening unofficial relationship''.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
                    (A) to further strengthen the United States-Taiwan 
                strategic relationship and broaden understanding of the

SEC. 213. INCREASING DEPARTMENT OF STATE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES 
              DEVOTED TO THE INDO-PACIFIC.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In fiscal year 2020, the Department of State allocated 
        $1,500,000,000 to the Indo-Pacific region in bilateral and 
        regional foreign assistance resources, including as authorized 
        by section 201(b) of the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 
        2018 (Public Law 115-409; 132 Stat. 5391), and $798,000,000 in 
        the fiscal year 2020 diplomatic engagement budget. These 
        amounts represent only 5 percent of the diplomatic engagement 
        budget and only 4 percent of the total Department of State-
        USAID budget.
            (2) Over the last 5 years the diplomatic engagement budget 
        and personnel levels in the Indo-Pacific averaged only 5 
        percent of the total, while foreign assistance resources 
        averaged only 4 percent of the total.
            (3) In 2020, the Department of State began a process to 
        realign certain positions at posts to ensure that its personnel 
        footprint matches the demands of great-power competition, 
        including in the Indo-Pacific.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the size of the United States diplomatic corps must be 
        sufficient to meet the current and emerging challenges of the 
        21st century, including those in the Indo-Pacific region and 
        elsewhere;
            (2) robust Chinese-language skills are necessary for the 
        success of the United States diplomatic corps and integral to 
        its ability to meet national security objectives;
            (3) the increase must be designed to meet the objectives of 
        an Indo-Pacific strategy focused on strengthening the good 
        governance and sovereignty of countries that adhere to and 
        uphold the rules-based international order; and
            (4) the increase must be implemented with a focus on 
        increased numbers of economic, political, and public diplomacy 
        officers, representing a cumulative increase of at least 200 
        Foreign Service officer generalists, to--
                    (A) advance free, fair, and reciprocal trade and 
                open investment environments for United States 
                entities, and engaged in increased commercial diplomacy 
                in key markets;
                    (B) better articulate and explain United States 
                policies, strengthen civil society and democratic 
                principles, enhance reporting on global activities, 
                promote people-to-people exchanges, and advance United 
                States influence; and
                    (C) increase capacity at small- and medium-sized 
                embassies and consulates in the Indo-Pacific and other 
                regions around the world, as necessary.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) ensure Department of State funding levels and personnel 
        footprint in the Indo-Pacific reflect the region's high degree 
        of importance and significance to United States political, 
        economic, and security interests; and
            (2) increase diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance 
        funding and the quantity of personnel dedicated to the Indo-
        Pacific region respective to the Department of State's total 
        budget.
    (d) Action Plan.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the

globally, China now has more diplomatic posts around the world than any 
other country, including the United States. Many of Beijing's new 
missions can be found in countries that recently broke ties with Taiwan

Tome and Principe) or do not have any United States diplomatic physical 
presence despite these countries asking for increased United States

SEC. 219B. REPORT ON ORIGINS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is critical to understand the origins of the COVID-
        19 pandemic so the United States can better prepare, prevent, 
        and respond to pandemic health threats in the future;
            (2) given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all 
        Americans, the American people deserve to know what information 
        the United States Government possesses about the origins of 
        COVID-19, as appropriate;
            (3) it is critical for independent experts to have full 
        access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, 
        biological sample, research, and personnel involved in the 
        early stages of the outbreak relevant to determining how this 
        pandemic emerged;
            (4) Congress shares the concerns expressed by the United 
        States Government and 13 other foreign governments that the 
        international team of experts dispatched to the People's 
        Republic of China by the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
        study the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was ``significantly 
        delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and 
        samples'';
            (5) the March 30, 2021, statement by the Director-General 
        of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, further affirms 
        that the investigative team had encountered ``difficulties'' in 
        accessing necessary raw data, that ``we have not yet found the 
        source of the virus'', and that ``all hypotheses remain on the 
        table'';
            (6) the G7 communique expressing support for full 
        implementation of the International Health Regulations, 
        including ``a timely, transparent, expert-led, and science-
        based WHO-convened Phase 2 COVID-19 Origins study including, as 
        recommended by the experts' report, in China'' is a valuable 
        commitment by the United States and its allies to investigating 
        the origins of COVID-19 in order to better prepare for future 
        pandemics; and
            (7) Congress supports the effort announced by President 
        Biden, directing the intelligence community to conduct a 90 day 
        review to further analyze information pointing to the origins 
        of COVID-19.
    (b) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after enactment of 
this Act, the President shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report consisting of--
            (1) an assessment of the most likely source or origin of 
        the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including a detailed review of all 
        information the United States possesses that it has identified 
        as potentially relevant to the source or origin of the SARS-
        CoV-2 virus, including zoonotic transmission and spillover, or 
        other sources of origin, transmission, or spillover, based on 
        the information the United States Government has to date;
            (2) its level of confidence in its assessment; and
            (3) challenges identified to its ability to make such an 
        assessment.
    (c) Form.--The report required by subsection (b) shall be submitted 
in unclassified form but may include a classified annex.

            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;

        Senate;
            (5) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives;
            (6) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the

            (7) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives.

SEC. 219C. EXTENSION OF ASIA REASSURANCE INITIATIVE ACT OF 2018.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Indo-Pacific region is home to many of the world's 
        most dynamic democracies, economic opportunities, as well as 
        many challenges to United States interests and values as a 
        result of the growth in authoritarian governance in the region 
        and by broad challenges posed by nuclear proliferation, the 
        changing environment, and deteriorating adherence to human 
        rights principles and obligations;
            (2) the People's Republic of China poses a particular 
        threat as it repeatedly violates internationally recognized 
        human rights, engages in unfair economic and trade practices, 
        disregards international laws and norms, coerces its neighbors, 
        engages in malign influence operations, and enables global 
        digital authoritarianism;
            (3) the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (``ARIA'') 
        enhances the United States' commitment in the Indo-Pacific 
        region by--
                    (A) expanding its defense cooperation with its 
                allies and partners;
                    (B) investing in democracy and the protection of 
                human rights;
                    (C) engaging in cybersecurity initiatives; and
                    (D) supporting people-to-people engagement and 
                other shared priorities; and
            (4) the 2019 Department of Defense Indo-Pacific Strategy 
        Report concludes that ARIA ``enshrines a generational whole-of-
        government policy framework that demonstrates U.S. commitment 
        to a free and open Indo-Pacific region''.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--The Asia Reassurance 
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409) is amended--
            (1) in section 201(b), by striking ``$1,500,000,000 for 
        each of the fiscal years 2019 through 2023'' and inserting 
        ``$2,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026'';

        ``2026'';
            (3) in section 306(a)--

                inserting ``8 years''; and
                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``2023'' and 
                inserting ``2026'';
            (4) in section 409(a)(1), by striking ``2023'' and 
        inserting ``2026'';
            (5) in section 410--
                    (A) in subsection (c), by striking ``2023'' and 
                inserting ``2026''; and
                    (B) in subsection (d), in the matter preceding 
                paragraph (1), by striking ``2023'' and inserting 
                ``2026''; and
            (6) in section 411, by striking ``2023'' and inserting 
        ``2026''.

                    (C) to reject any PRC claim to waters beyond a 12

        and guidelines, including the International Regulations for

        countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and 
        capacity building, as well as efforts by the United States 
        Government to explore the development of appropriate 
        multilateral mechanisms for a ``common operating picture'' in 
        the South China Sea among Southeast Asian countries that would 
        serve to help countries avoid destabilizing behavior and deter 
        risky and dangerous activities;
            (13) oppose actions by any country to prevent any other 
        country from exercising its sovereign rights to the resources 
        of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf by 
        making claims to those areas in the South China Sea that have 
        no support in international law; and

        States in the Indo-Pacific region, including, when appropriate,

            (5) it is in the United States interest to not authorize 
        arms transfers or security cooperation to governments that

            (1) urge NATO allies to work closely with like-minded 
        partners, in particular with the European Union, to protect 
        critical infrastructure, strengthen resilience, maintain a 
        technological edge, and address the challenges to the rules-
        based international order posed by the Chinese Communist Party;
            (2) encourage NATO allies to explore how to monitor and 
        defend against any activity of the Chinese Communist Party that 
        could impact collective defense, military readiness, or 
        resilience in the Supreme Allied Commander Europe's Area of 
        Responsibility, including by identifying vulnerabilities of key 
        sectors and supply chains, in coordination with the European

     Subtitle C--Multilateral Strategies to Bolster American Power

SEC. 231. FINDINGS ON MULTILATERAL ENGAGEMENT.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Every UN member state is legally required to finance 
        the UN's core budget in order to ensure that these missions are 
        properly resourced, and assessment rates are renegotiated every 
        three years by the UN General Assembly.
            (2) While the United States is the largest single financial 
        contributor to the UN system, the current model is beneficial 
        because it requires all UN member states, no matter how big or 
        small, to help shoulder the UN's regular and peacekeeping 
        budgets at specified levels.
            (3) Failing to meet our financial commitments to the UN 
        also empowers the PRC, which has raised our annual shortfalls 
        to claim we are not a reliable partner and is seeking to 
        leverage its own contributions to the regular budget and 
        peacekeeping in ways that run counter to United States 
        interests and values.
            (4) The People's Republic of China is now the second 
        largest financial contributor to UN peacekeeping, having gone 
        from an assessment rate of just 3 percent in 2008 to more than 
        15 percent today, and is the ninth largest troop-contributor to 
        UN missions, providing more personnel than the other four 
        permanent members of the Security Council combined.
            (5) With greater engagement comes greater influence, and 
        PRC diplomats have sought to use their expanded clout to push 
        back against the human rights, civilian protection, and gender-
        based violence aspects of UN peacekeeping mandates, using 
        United States funding shortfalls as a pretext.
            (6) The PRC has also used its growing clout to fill key 
        posts at UN agencies: Chinese nationals currently occupy the 
        top posts of four of the UN's 15 specialized agencies, while 
        the United States occupies only one.
            (7) From 2021 to 2022, there will be 15 elections for the 
        heads of UN specialized agencies and five for major UN funds 
        and programs. With the exception of the World Food Programme, 
        none are currently led by Americans.
            (8) A 2020 Department of State Inspector General Inspection 
        found that the Bureau for International Organizations did not 
        have a standard operating procedure for tracking and promoting 
        the employment of American Citizens in the UN system, and their 
        recommendation to the department to establish one remains open.

SEC. 232. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON AMERICA'S MULTILATERAL ENGAGEMENT.

        to detail or transfer employees to relevant international 
        organizations;
            (4) the Secretary of State should assist the Department of 
        State and other Federal agencies in carrying out paragraph (3) 
        to the fullest extent;
            (5) the Secretary of State should support qualified

                       PART I--WESTERN HEMISPHERE

SEC. 242. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES-CANADA RELATIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and Canada have a unique relationship 
        based on shared geography, extensive personal connections, deep 
        economic ties, mutual defense commitments, and a shared vision 
        to uphold democracy, human rights, and the rules based 
        international order established after World War II;
            (2) the United States and Canada can better address the 
        People's Republic of China's economic, political, and security 
        influence through closer cooperation on counternarcotics, 
        environmental stewardship, transparent practices in public 
        procurement and infrastructure planning, the Arctic, energy and 
        connectivity issues, trade and commercial relations, bilateral 
        legal matters, and support for democracy, good governance, and 
        human rights;
            (3) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States and 
        Canada should maintain joint initiatives to address border 
        management, commercial and trade relations and infrastructure, 
        a shared approach with respect to the People's Republic of 
        China, and transnational challenges, including pandemics, 
        energy security, and environmental stewardship;
            (4) the United States and Canada should enhance cooperation 
        to counter Chinese disinformation, influence operations, 
        economic espionage, and propaganda efforts;
            (5) the People's Republic of China's infrastructure 
        investments, particularly in 5G telecommunications technology, 
        extraction of natural resources, and port infrastructure, pose 
        national security risks for the United States and Canada;
            (6) the United States should share, as appropriate, 
        intelligence gathered regarding--
                    (A) Huawei's 5G capabilities; and

                5G expansion;
            (7) the United States and Canada should continue to advance 
        collaborative initiatives to implement the January 9, 2020, 
        United States-Canada Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals 
        Development Collaboration; and
            (8) the United States and Canada should prioritize 
        cooperation on continental defense and in the Arctic, including 
        by modernizing the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
        (NORAD) sensor architecture to provide effective warning and 
        tracking of threats by peer competitors, including long-range 
        missiles and high-precision weapons, to the Northern 
        Hemisphere.

              CANADIAN CITIZENS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China's 
        apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian 
        nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent 
        retaliation for the Government of Canada's arrest of Meng 
        Wanzhou is deeply concerning;
            (2) the Government of Canada has shown international 
        leadership by--
                    (A) upholding the rule of law and complying with 
                its international legal obligations, including 
                obligations pursuant to the Extradition Treaty Between 
                the United States of America and Canada, signed at 
                Washington December 3, 1971; and
                    (B) launching the Declaration Against Arbitrary 
                Detention in State-to-State Relations, which has been 
                endorsed by 57 countries and the European Union, and 
                reaffirms well-established prohibitions under 
                international human rights conventions against the 
                arbitrary detention of foreign nationals to be used as 
                leverage in country-to-country relations; and
            (3) the United States continues to join the Government of 
        Canada in calling for the immediate release of Michael Spavor 
        and Michael Kovrig and for due process for Canadian national 
        Robert Schellenberg.

        of activities that would be carried out under this subsection.

SEC. 249. CARIBBEAN ENERGY INITIATIVE AS ALTERNATIVE TO CHINA'S BELT 
              AND ROAD INITIATIVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The countries of the Caribbean are heavily reliant upon 
        imported oil to provide for approximately 90 percent of their 
        energy production.
            (2) The level of dependence is even higher including--
                    (A) Jamaica, which relies on oil for 95.9 percent 
                of its electricity;
                    (B) Barbados, which relies on oil for 96 percent of 
                its electricity;
                    (C) The Virgin Islands, which relies on oil for 
                nearly 100 percent of its electricity; and
                    (D) St. Lucia, which relies on oil for 100 percent 
                of its electricity.
            (3) Overreliance on imported fossil fuels has had a 
        detrimental effect on economic development, growth, and 
        competitiveness in the Caribbean.
            (4) Since 1970, more than 80 percent of Caribbean coral 
        reefs have been lost due to coastal development and pollution. 
        Soot particulates and climate change caused by burning fossil 
        fuels have seriously damaged coral reefs, which are a 
        significant source of tourism dollars, fishing, biodiversity, 
        and natural beauty.
            (5) Air pollution caused by burning oil for electricity--
                    (A) has serious health impacts in the form of 
                higher rates of asthma and other lung ailments; and
                    (B) can also exacerbate climate change.
            (6) The Caribbean region is particularly vulnerable to sea 
        level rise and stronger storms.
            (7) Between 2005 and 2018, the dependence of the countries 
        of the Caribbean on oil was perpetuated by the Venezuelan-led 
        Petrocaribe oil alliance, which--
                    (A) offered preferential terms for oil sales; and
                    (B) supplies some countries with up to 40 percent 
                of their energy production needs.
            (8) The ongoing domestic economic crisis and political 
        turmoil in Venezuela has forced the Government of Venezuela to 
        retract its commitments to the Petrocaribe oil alliance and 
        step away as a regional power. Only Cuba still receives 
        preferential Petrocaribe pricing on fuel exports from 
        Venezuela, while other Petrocaribe member countries are 
        experiencing a destabilized flow of oil.
            (9) China has spent more than $244,000,000,000 on energy 
        projects worldwide since 2000, 25 percent of which was spent in 
        Latin America and the Caribbean. Although the majority of this 
        spending was for oil, gas, and coal, China has also been the 
        largest investor in clean energy globally for almost a decade.
            (10) The World Bank estimates that the Caribbean will need 
        $12,000,000,000 in power investments through 2035.
            (11) Renewable energy technology costs have decreased 
        dramatically in recent years, offering a more viable economic 
        alternative for energy production. Solar energy prices have 
        fallen by 80 percent since 2008, causing significant market 
        growth, and according to data released by the International 
        Renewable Energy Agency, \1/3\ of global power capacity is 
        based in renewable energy.
            (12) In 2016, the International Monetary Fund estimated 
        that transportation accounted for 36 percent of the total 
        primary energy consumed in the Caribbean subregion.
            (13) According to the United Nations Environment Programme, 
        Latin America and the Caribbean could achieve annual savings of 
        $621,000,000,000 and a reduction of 1,100,000,000 tons of CO2 
        by 2050 if the region's energy and transport sectors reach net 
        zero emissions.
            (14) The Caribbean has an abundance of onshore and offshore 
        resources needed for renewable energy, including sun, wind, 
        geothermal, and some hydropower production capacity.
            (15) The United States Government is deeply engaged in 
        providing technical and policy assistance to countries of the 
        Caribbean on energy issues through--
                    (A) the Energy and Climate Partnership of the 
                Americas;
                    (B) Connecting the Americas 2022; and
                    (C) bilateral assistance programs.
            (16) On February 19, 2014, at the North American Leaders' 
        Summit, President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Stephen Harper 
        of Canada, and President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico 
        reaffirmed their commitment to bring affordable, reliable, and 
        increasingly renewable power to the Caribbean, while opening 
        wider markets for clean energy and green technology.
            (17) On June 19, 2015, President Barack Obama announced the 
        Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, which would partner with 
        individual countries--
                    (A) to transform its energy sector;
                    (B) to work to increase access to finance, good 
                governance, and diversification; and
                    (C) to maximize the impact of existing donor 
                effects.
            (18) On May 4, 2016, at the United States-Caribbean-Central 
        American Energy Summit, the energy security task force formally 
        launched the Caribbean Sustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy 
        (C-SERMS) as a mechanism to manage regional coordination and 
        action on energy security and agreed to expand the regional 
        market and transmission system.
            (19) The United States has an important opportunity--
                    (A) to deepen this engagement;
                    (B) to work as a partner with Caribbean countries 
                on a more regional and coordinated basis;
                    (C) to help ease the region's dependence on 
                imported oil; and
                    (D) to promote affordable alternative sources of 
                energy.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Caribbean countries.--The term ``Caribbean countries'' 
        means countries in the Caribbean region, but does not include 
        Cuba or Venezuela.
            (2) Caribbean governments.--The term ``Caribbean 
        governments'' means the national governments of the Caribbean 
        countries.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
help Caribbean countries--
            (1) achieve greater energy security and improve domestic 
        energy resource mobilization;
            (2) lower their dependence on imported fuels;
            (3) eliminate the use of diesel, heavy fuel oil, other 
        petroleum products, and coal for the generation of electricity;
            (4) increase production of renewable energy; and
            (5) meet the greenhouse gas mitigation goals of their 
        national determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.

        appropriate congressional committees a multi-year strategy that 
        describes how the Department of State will promote regional 
        cooperation with Caribbean countries--
                    (A) to lower dependence on imported fuels, grow 
                domestic clean energy production in the region, 
                strengthen regional energy security, and lower energy 
                sector greenhouse gas emissions;
                    (B) to decrease dependence on oil in the

                        entrepreneurship;
                    (C) measures to ensure that each Caribbean 
                government has--
                            (i) an independent utility regulator or 
                        equivalent;
                            (ii) affordable access by third party 
                        investors to its electrical grid with minimal 
                        regulatory interference;
                            (iii) effective energy efficiency and 
                        energy conservation;
                            (iv) programs to address technical and 
                        nontechnical issues;

                        distortions;
                            (vi) cost-reflective tariffs; and
                            (vii) no tariffs or other taxes on clean 
                        energy solutions; and
                    (D) recommendations for how United States policy, 
                technical, and economic assistance can be used in the 
                Caribbean region--
                            (i) to advance renewable energy development 
                        and the incorporation of renewable technologies 
                        into existing energy grids and the development 
                        and deployment of micro-grids where appropriate 
                        and feasible to boost energy security and 
                        reliability, particularly to underserved 
                        communities;
                            (ii) to increase the generation of clean 
                        energy sufficiently to replace and allow for 
                        the retirement of obsolete fossil fuel energy 
                        generation units in Caribbean countries;
                            (iii) to create regional financing 
                        opportunities to allow for lower cost energy 
                        entrepreneurship;
                            (iv) to deploy transaction advisors in the 
                        region to help attract private investment and 
                        break down any market or regulatory barriers; 
                        and
                            (v) to establish a mechanism for each host 
                        government to have access to independent legal 
                        advice--

SEC. 250. UNITED STATES-CARIBBEAN RESILIENCE PARTNERSHIP.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States shares with the Caribbean a 
        collective vulnerability to natural disasters, which affects 
        the lives and the economies of our citizens.
            (2) The April 9, 2021, eruption of the La Soufriere volcano 
        is another reminder of the devastation caused by the many 
        natural disasters the Caribbean confronts each year and the 
        region's vulnerability to external shocks. Hurricane Dorian, 
        the largest storm to hit the region, wiped out large parts of 
        the northern Bahamas in 2019, and Hurricanes Maria and Irma 
        devastated multiple islands across the region in 2017, 
        including Puerto Rico. According to IMF research, of the 511 
        plus disasters worldwide to hit small states since 1950, around 
        two-thirds (324) have been in the Caribbean.
            (3) This region is seven times more likely to experience a 
        natural disaster than elsewhere. And, when one occurs, it will 
        incur as much as six times more damage.
            (4) Extreme weather events and other environmental impacts 
        will only worsen over the coming years, and if not addressed, 
        we will see only increasing economic shocks on these countries, 
        driving irregular migration.
            (5) While the United States has considerable expertise and 
        capacity in assisting countries with disaster response, there 
        remains a need for stronger partnerships that build regional 
        resilience through efficient and interoperable platforms, 
        protecting people and speeding recovery.
            (6) The People's Republic of China has dramatically 
        increased its engagement in the Caribbean in the past five 
        years, including offering loans and grants related to disaster 
        response and resilience and sought to acquire property rights 
        in the Caribbean that would be detrimental to United States 
        national security interests.
            (7) In 2019, the United States launched a new U.S.-
        Caribbean Resilience Partnership to deepen cooperation and 
        investment to strengthen our disaster resilience throughout the 
        Caribbean region, including--
                    (A) to streamline early warning response networks 
                and formalize communication channels;
                    (B) to enhance, encourage, and work collaboratively 
                on further developing aviation disaster resilience 
                plans and partnerships;
                    (C) to prioritize regional technical exchange in 
                energy planning, risk reduction, and resilience;
                    (D) to increase communications network 
                interoperability between Caribbean partners and the 
                United States;
                    (E) to utilize storm surge mapping data and share 
                real-time information in preparation for potential 
                damage resulting from tropical cyclones and tsunamis;
                    (F) to use meteorological services to strengthen 
                and deepen physical and communications infrastructure, 
                data collection networks, and human and technical 
                capacity throughout the region, as well as interactions 
                with the public;
                    (G) to understand that while the use of 
                international and military and civil defense assets in 
                disaster response may only be considered as a last 
                resort, when local, national, and international 
                civilian capabilities are overwhelmed, civil-military 
                coordination should occur, in support of the affected 
                nation;
                    (H) to develop a framework that would govern the 
                deployment of international military and civil defense 
                assets in disaster response when local, national, and 
                international civilian capabilities are overwhelmed, in 
                support of the affected nation;
                    (I) to seek common mechanisms for ensuring rapid 
                disaster response and recovery, including waiving or 
                expediting diplomatic clearances, waiving of or 
                reducing customs fees, streamlining overflight and 
                airspace clearance, and ensuring that the first 
                responders have the ability to rapidly respond to 
                disasters in other countries;
                    (J) to promote the integration and coordination of 
                regional response mechanisms in the Caribbean, 
                including through the Caribbean Disaster Emergency 
                Management Agency, the Regional Security System, United 
                States Government Agencies, and allies in ways that 
                facilitate more effective and efficient planning, 
                mitigation, response, and resilience to natural 
                disasters;
                    (K) to share best practices in improved building 
                codes with national disaster organizations, including 
                building better programs, at regional, national and 
                community levels; and
                    (L) to promote community-based disaster 
                preparedness and mitigation activities, particularly in 
                underserved communities, with the aim of increasing 
                broad public participation and resilience.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to help 
Caribbean countries--
            (1) increase their resilience and adapt to natural 
        disasters and the impacts of severe weather events and a 
        changing environment;
            (2) partner with United States Federal, State, and local 
        agencies and engage in technical cooperation, dialogue, and 
        assistance activities;
            (3) harmonize standards and practices related to paragraphs 
        (1) and (2) to promote increased investment and integration;
            (4) increase investment from United States companies in the 
        Caribbean on resilience-building, adaptation, and climate-
        related mitigation efforts;
            (5) promote regional cooperation and ensure efforts by the 
        United States, Caribbean countries, and international partners 
        complement each other; and
            (6) further assist with the efforts described in subsection 
        (a)(7).
    (c) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
heads of other Federal departments and agencies, shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a multi-year strategy that 
describes how the Department of State will achieve the policies 
described in subsection (b).
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for activities, programs, technical assistance, and 
engagement under this section the following:
            (1) $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2022.
            (2) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2023.
            (3) $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year 
        thereafter.
    (e) Reporting and Monitoring.--
            (1) In general.--Of the amounts authorized to be 
        appropriated each fiscal year pursuant to subsection (d), at 
        least five percent of all programming funding allocation shall 
        support and be directed toward reporting, monitoring, and 
        assessment of effectiveness.
            (2) Engagement and collaboration.--The Department of State 
        shall ensure that at least 20 percent of amounts authorized to 
        be appropriated pursuant to subsection (d) directly support the 
        training of, engagement with, collaboration with, and exchange 
        of expertise on resilience between United States Federal, 
        State, and local officials and their Caribbean government 
        counterparts. Such amounts should also support, as appropriate, 
        increased academic, civil society, media, and private sector 
        engagement in the fields of resilience-building, adaptation, 
        and mitigation.

SEC. 251. COUNTERING CHINA'S EDUCATIONAL AND CULTURAL DIPLOMACY IN 
              LATIN AMERICA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a report by the National Endowment for 
        Democracy, China has spent the equivalent of billions of 
        dollars to shape public opinion and perceptions around the 
        world through thousands of people-to-people exchanges, cultural 
        activities, educational programs, and the development of media 
        enterprises and information initiatives with global reach.
            (2) Educational and exchange programs are a core element of 
        United States public diplomacy, elevating our culture, 
        policies, and interests worldwide.
            (3) These programs provide students with access to 
        international knowledge, an opportunity to learn foreign 
        languages, and a unique environment for developing cultural 
        understanding, all of which are valuable skills in today's 
        global economy.
            (4) 90 percent of ECA's appropriation is spent in the 
        United States or invested directly in American citizens or 
        American organizations.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) China's efforts to mold public opinion and influence 
        educational institutions undermine United States' influence in 
        Latin America and the Caribbean and threaten democratic 
        institutions and practices in the region;
            (2) the United States Government should expand current 
        educational and cultural exchange programs in Latin America and 
        the Caribbean, which are cost-effective and strengthen people-
        to-people diplomacy, to promote national security and foreign 
        policy interests of the United States; and
            (3) educational exchanges foster linguistic, cultural, and 
        educational skills that advance United States economic 
        competitiveness, strengthen alliances, and support democracies 
        worldwide.
    (c) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, acting through the 
Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, and 
in coordination with the Assistant Administrator for the Bureau of 
Economic Growth, Education, and Environment at the United States Agency 
for International Development, shall devise a strategy--
            (1) to evaluate and expand existing programs and, as 
        necessary, design and implement new educational, professional, 
        and cultural exchanges and other programs to--
                    (A) create and sustain mutual understanding with 
                other countries necessary to advance United States 
                foreign policy goals by cultivating people-to-people 
                ties among current and future global leaders that build 
                enduring networks and personal relationships; and
                    (B) promote United States national security 
                interests and values, including through the expansion 
                of exchange visitor programs such as international 
                visitor leadership programs and the Young Leaders of 
                the Americas Initiative, as well as professional 
                capacity building programs that prioritize building 
                skills in entrepreneurship, promoting transparency, and 
                technology;
            (2) to ensure that exchange programs for Americans abroad 
        and international visitors attract a diverse pool of 
        participants, including from underrepresented, marginalized, 
        and low-income communities; and
            (3) to evaluate, expand, and strengthen existing programs, 
        and, as necessary, design and implement new basic and higher 
        education programs in Latin America and the Caribbean, in 
        accordance with the United States Strategy on International 
        Basic Education and the United States Agency for International 
        Development Education Policy, to enable all young adults, 
        youth, and children to acquire the quality education and skills 
        needed to be productive members in society, which will lead to 
        better individual and societal outcomes.
    (d) Report With Intelligence Assessment.--Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State 
shall, in coordination with the Director of National Intelligence, 
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report that 
assesses the nature and impact of the People's Republic of China's 
educational and cultural sector activity in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, its impact on United States' strategic interests, and 
recommendations for the United States Government to expand people-to-
people ties.

SEC. 252. NARCOTICS TRAFFICKING IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) narcotics trafficking continues to pose a security 
        threat to the countries and peoples of Latin America and the 
        Caribbean;
            (2) other forms of transnational organized crime, including 
        arms trafficking, human smuggling, money laundering, and 
        illicit financing, are drivers of irregular migration;
            (3) narcotics trafficking is fueled by governments that 
        fail to curb the illicit drug trade by adequately regulating 
        the legal trade of non-fentanyl opioids and precursor chemicals 
        used to produce fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and other synthetic 
        drugs;
            (4) further, governments that do not cooperate sufficiently 
        on financial investigations and prosecutions, withhold 
        information with respect to money laundering crimes, or are 
        determined to facilitate illicit activities, particularly by 
        transnational organized criminal organizations, should be held 
        accountable;
            (5) as noted in the International Narcotics Control 
        Strategy Report 2020, China ``has not cooperated sufficiently 
        on financial investigations and does not provide adequate 
        responses to requests for financial investigation 
        information'';
            (6) the United States should apply economic and other 
        targeted financial sanctions with respect to individuals 
        engaged in financial crimes and money laundering that fosters 
        narcotics trafficking in the countries of Latin America and the 
        Caribbean; and
            (7) the United States should look to policies to hold 
        accountable countries that fail to sufficiently investigate 
        financial crimes and money laundering that foster narcotics 
        trafficking in the countries of Latin America and the 
        Caribbean.

                  PART II--TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIPS

SEC. 255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRANSATLANTIC RELATIONSHIPS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States, European Union, the United Kingdom, 
        and other European countries are close partners, sharing values 
        grounded in democracy, human rights, transparency, and the 
        rules-based international order established after World War II;
            (2) without a common approach by the United States, 
        European Union, the United Kingdom, and other European 
        countries on connectivity, trade, transnational challenges, and 
        support for democracy and human rights, the People's Republic 
        of China will continue to increase its economic, political, and 
        security leverage in Europe;
            (3) the People's Republic of China's deployment of 
        assistance to European countries following the COVID-19 
        outbreak showcased a coercive approach to aid, but it also 
        highlighted Europe's deep economic ties to the People's 
        Republic of China;
            (4) as European countries seek to recover from the economic 
        toll of the COVID-19 outbreak, the United States must stand in 
        partnership with Europe to support our collective economic 
        recovery, reinforce our collective national security, and 
        defend shared values;
            (5) the United States, European Union, the United Kingdom, 
        and other European countries should coordinate on joint 
        strategies to diversify reliance on supply chains away from the 
        People's Republic of China, especially in the medical and 
        pharmaceutical sectors;
            (6) the United States, European Union, the United Kingdom, 
        and other European countries should leverage their respective 
        economic innovation capabilities to support the global economic 
        recovery from the COVID-19 recession and draw a contrast with 
        the centralized economy of the People's Republic of China;
            (7) the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union 
        should accelerate efforts to de-escalate their trade disputes, 
        including negotiating a United States-European Union trade 
        agreement that benefits workers and the broader economy in both 
        the United States and European Union;
            (8) the United States, European Union, and Japan should 
        continue trilateral efforts to address the security, economic, 
        democracy, and human rights challenges posed by the People's 
        Republic of China;
            (9) the United States, European Union, the United Kingdom, 
        and other European countries should enhance cooperation to 
        counter People's Republic of China disinformation, influence 
        operations, and propaganda efforts;
            (10) the United States and Europe share serious concerns 
        with the repressions being supported and executed by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China, and should 
        continue implementing measures to address the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China's specific abuses in Tibet, Hong 
        Kong, and Xinjiang, and should build joint mechanisms and 
        programs to prevent the export of China's authoritarian 
        governance model to countries around the world;
            (11) the United States and Europe should remain united in 
        their shared values against attempts by the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China at the United Nations and other 
        multilateral organizations to promote efforts that erode the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, like the ``community of 
        a shared future for mankind'' and ``democratization of 
        international relations'';
            (12) the People's Republic of China's infrastructure 
        investments around the world, particularly in 5G 
        telecommunications technology and port infrastructure, could 
        threaten democracy across Europe and the national security of 
        key countries;
            (13) as appropriate, the United States should share 
        intelligence with European allies and partners on Huawei's 5G 
        capabilities and the intentions of the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China with respect to 5G expansion in 
        Europe;
            (14) the European Union's Investment Screening Regulation, 
        which came into force in October 2020, is a welcome 
        development, and member states should closely scrutinize PRC 
        investments in their countries through their own national 
        investment screening measures;
            (15) the President should actively engage the European 
        Union on the implementation of the Export Control Reform Act 
        regulations and to better harmonize United States and European 
        Union policies with respect to export controls;
            (16) the President should strongly advocate for the listing 
        of more items and technologies to restrict dual use exports 
        controlled at the National Security and above level to the 
        People's Republic of China under the Wassenaar Arrangement;
            (17) the United States should explore the value of 
        establishing a body akin to the Coordinating Committee for 
        Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) that would specifically 
        coordinate United States and European Union export control 
        policies with respect to limiting exports of sensitive 
        technologies to the People's Republic of China; and
            (18) the United States should work with counterparts in 
        Europe to--
                    (A) evaluate United States and European 
                overreliance on goods originating in the People's 
                Republic of China, including in the medical and 
                pharmaceutical sectors, and develop joint strategies to 
                diversify supply chains;
                    (B) develop a common strategy for promoting energy 
                security and economic growth in eastern Europe and the 
                Balkans that addresses shared concerns related to 
                China's Belt and Road Initiative in these regions, 
                including complementary investments in the Three Seas 
                Initiative Fund for clean energy and digital 
                connectivity projects;
                    (C) counter PRC efforts to use COVID-19-related 
                assistance as a coercive tool to pressure developing 
                countries by offering relevant United States and 
                European expertise and assistance; and
                    (D) leverage the United States and European private 
                sectors to advance the post-COVID-19 economic recovery.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Chief Executive Officer of the United States Agency for Global 
Media shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report 
on the resources and timeline needed to establish within the Agency an 
organization the mission of which shall be to promote democratic values 
and institutions in Africa by providing objective, accurate, and 
relevant news and information to the people of Africa and counter 
disinformation from malign actors, especially in countries in which a 
free press is banned by the government or not fully established, about 
the region, the world, and the United States through uncensored news, 
responsible discussion, and open debate.

SEC. 276. AFRICA ENERGY SECURITY AND DIVERSIFICATION.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
support increased access to energy in Africa and reduce Africa's energy 
dependence on countries that use energy reliance for undue political 
influence such as the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of 
China.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Lack of access to energy remains a significant barrier 
        to economic advancement and opportunity in Africa. As of 2018, 
        an estimated 789,000,000 people, the vast majority of them in 
        sub-Saharan Africa, lacked access to any modern electricity. 
        Even in the region's most advanced economies, average annual 
        per capita electricity consumption is often under 200 kilowatt-
        hours, less than what is needed to power a typical 
        refrigerator. Only a small fraction of the 12,000,000 young 
        Africans who enter the job market each year find employment; 
        and the cost and reliability of electricity remain top 
        constraints to job creation and economic competitiveness.
            (2) The United States' global strategic competitors have 
        stepped in to address this disparity and finance energy sector 
        development across Africa. China is the single largest trading 
        partner for African countries in aggregate, and the largest 
        bilateral lender for public sector loans across Africa. 
        Approximately 65 percent of Chinese lending to Africa goes to 
        infrastructure, and between 2013-2020, the energy sector 
        consistently accounted for the largest share of all investment 
        under China's Belt and Road Initiative.
            (3) Reliable, affordable, and sustainable power is the 
        foundation for all modern economies and necessary for 
        increasing growth and employment.
            (4) Increasing energy supply in low- and lower middle-
        income countries is necessary in the next decades in order to 
        meet human, social, security, and economic needs.
            (5) Addressing energy poverty, powering inclusive 
        economies, and making energy systems resilient in low- and 
        lower middle-income countries will require diversified power 
        systems and a mix of technologies that align with local 
        conditions, resources, and needs.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that countries 
in Africa continue to be important partners to the United States and 
the DFC should continue to make investments in sub-Saharan Africa to 
facilitate technologies that contribute to energy security and 
reliable, affordable, and sustainable power in low and lower middle-
income countries.
    (d) Amendment.--Section 3 of the Electrify Africa Act of 2015 
(Public Law 114-121; 22 U.S.C. 2293 note) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (9), by striking the period and inserting 
        a semicolon; and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (9) the following:
            ``(10) advance United States foreign policy and development 
        goals by assisting African countries to reduce their dependence 
        on energy resources from countries that use energy dependence 
        for undue political influence, such as the Russian Federation 
        or the People's Republic of China, which have used energy and 
        financial resources to influence other countries;
            ``(11) promote the energy security of allies and partners 
        of the United States by encouraging the development of 
        accessible, transparent, and competitive energy markets that 
        provide diversified sources and reliable, affordable, and 
        sustainable power;
            ``(12) encourage United States public and private sector 
        investment in African energy infrastructure projects to bridge 
        the gap between energy security requirements and commercial 
        demand in a way that is consistent with the region's capacity; 
        and
            ``(13) help facilitate the export of United States energy 
        resources, technology, and expertise to global markets in a way 
        that benefits the energy security of allies and partners of the 
        United States, including in Africa.''.

                  PART V--MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA

SEC. 281. STRATEGY TO COUNTER CHINESE INFLUENCE IN, AND ACCESS TO, THE 
              MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the People's Republic of China is upgrading its 
        influence in the Middle East and North Africa through its 
        energy and infrastructure investments, technology transfer, and 
        arms sales;
            (2) the People's Republic of China seeks to establish 
        military or dual use facilities in geographically strategic 
        locations in the Middle East and North Africa to further its 
        Belt and Road Initiative at the expense of United States 
        national security interests; and
            (3) the export of certain communications infrastructure 
        from the People's Republic of China degrades the security of 
        partner networks, exposes intellectual property to theft, 
        threatens the ability of the United States to conduct security 
        cooperation with compromised regional partners, and furthers 
        China's authoritarian surveillance model.
    (b) Strategy Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator 
        of the United States Agency for International Development, and 
        the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies, shall jointly 
        develop and submit to the appropriate congressional committees 
        and the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the 
        House of Representatives a strategy for countering and limiting 
        the People's Republic of China's influence in, and access to, 
        the Middle East and North Africa.
            (2) Elements.--The strategy required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include--

                China's intent with regards to increased cooperation 
                with Middle East and North African countries and how 
                such cooperation fits into its broader global strategic 
                objectives;
                    (B) an assessment of how governments across the 
                region are responding to the People's Republic of 
                China's efforts to increase its military presence in 
                their countries;
                    (C) efforts to improve regional cooperation through 
                foreign military sales, financing, and efforts to build 
                partner capacity and increase interoperability with the 
                United States;
                    (D) an assessment of the People's Republic of 
                China's joint research and development with the Middle 
                East and North Africa, impacts on the United States' 
                national security interests, and recommended steps to 
                mitigate the People's Republic of China's influence in 
                such area;
                    (E) an assessment of arms sales and weapons 
                technology transfers from the People's Republic of

                United States' national security interests, and 
                recommended steps to mitigate the People's Republic of 
                China's influence in such area;

                and non-lethal unmanned aerial systems;
                    (G) an assessment of People's Republic of China 
                military basing and dual-use facility initiatives 
                across the Middle East and North Africa, impacts on 
                United States' national security interests, and 
                recommended steps to mitigate the People's Republic of

SEC. 282. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA ENGAGEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and the international community have 
        long-term interests in the stability, security, and prosperity 
        of the people of the Middle East and North Africa.
            (2) In addition to and apart from military and security 
        efforts, the United States should harness a whole of government 
        approach, including bilateral and multilateral statecraft, 
        economic lines of effort, and public diplomacy to compete with 
        and counter PRC influence.
            (3) A clearly articulated positive narrative of United 
        States engagement, transparent governance structures, and 
        active civil society engagement help counter predatory foreign 
        investment and influence efforts.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that the United States and the international community should continue 
diplomatic and economic efforts throughout the Middle East and North 
Africa that support reform efforts to--
            (1) promote greater economic opportunity;
            (2) foster private sector development;
            (3) strengthen civil society;
            (4) promote transparent and democratic governance and the 
        rule of law; and
            (5) promote greater regional integration and intraregional 
        cooperation, including with Israel.

SEC. 283. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA-IRAN 
              RELATIONSHIP.

economic relationship with Iran, including oil purchases in violation 
of United States sanctions, undermines United States efforts to compel 
Iran to abandon its malign activities.

                         PART VI--ARCTIC REGION

SEC. 285. ARCTIC DIPLOMACY.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Arctic Security.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) the rapidly changing Arctic environment--
                    (A) creates new national and regional security 
                challenges due to increased military activity in the 
                Arctic;
                    (B) heightens the risk of the Arctic emerging as a 
                major theater of conflict in ongoing strategic 
                competition;
                    (C) threatens maritime safety as Arctic littoral 
                countries have inadequate capacity to patrol the 
                increased vessel traffic in this remote region, which 
                is a result of diminished annual levels of sea ice;
                    (D) impacts public safety due to increased human 
                activity in the Arctic region where search and rescue 
                capacity remains very limited; and
                    (E) threatens the health of the Arctic's fragile 
                and pristine environment and the unique and highly 
                sensitive species found in the Arctic's marine and 
                terrestrial ecosystems; and
            (2) the United States should reduce the consequences 
        described in paragraph (1) by--
                    (A) evaluating the wide variety and dynamic set of 
                security and safety risks developing in the Arctic;
                    (B) developing policies and making preparations to 
                mitigate and respond to threats and risks in the 
                Arctic, including by continuing to work with allies and 
                partners in the Arctic region to deter potential 
                aggressive activities and build Arctic competencies;
                    (C) adequately funding the National Earth System 
                Prediction Capability to substantively improve weather, 
                ocean, and ice predictions on the time scales necessary 
                to ensure regional security and trans-Arctic shipping;
                    (D) investing in resources, including a 
                significantly expanded icebreaker fleet, to ensure that 
                the United States has adequate capacity to prevent and 
                respond to security threats in the Arctic region; and
                    (E) pursuing diplomatic engagements with all states 
                in the Arctic region to reach an agreement for--
                            (i) maintaining peace and stability in the 
                        Arctic region;
                            (ii) fostering cooperation on stewardship 
                        and safety initiatives in the Arctic region;
                            (iii) ensuring safe and efficient 
                        management of commercial maritime traffic in 
                        the Arctic;
                            (iv) promoting responsible natural resource 
                        management and economic development; and
                            (v) countering China's Polar Silk Road 
                        initiative;
                            (vi) examining the possibility of 
                        reconvening the Arctic Chiefs of Defense Forum; 
                        and
                            (vii) reducing black carbon and methane 
                        emissions in the Arctic Region, including by 
                        working with observers of the Arctic Council, 
                        including India and the People's Republic of 
                        China, to adopt mitigation plans consistent 
                        with the findings and recommendations of the 
                        Arctic Council's Framework for Action on Black 
                        Carbon and Methane.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to recognize only the states specified in subsection 
        (c)(1) as Arctic states, and to reject all other claims to such 
        status; and
            (2) that the militarization of the Arctic poses a serious 
        threat to Arctic peace and stability, and the interests of 
        United States allies and partners.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Arctic states.--The term ``Arctic states'' means

                       PART VIII--PACIFIC ISLANDS

SEC. 295. SHORT TITLE.

    This part may be cited as the ``Boosting Long-term U.S. Engagement 
in the Pacific Act'' or the ``BLUE Pacific Act''.

SEC. 296. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Pacific Islands--
                    (A) are home to roughly 10 million residents, 
                including over 8.6 million in Papua New Guinea, 
                constituting diverse and dynamic cultures and peoples;
                    (B) are spread across an expanse of the Pacific 
                Ocean equivalent to 15 percent of the Earth's surface, 
                including the three sub-regions of Melanesia, 
                Micronesia, and Polynesia; and
                    (C) face shared challenges in development that have 
                distinct local contexts, including climate change and 
                rising sea levels, geographic distances from major 
                markets, and vulnerability to external shocks such as 
                natural disasters.
            (2) The United States is a Pacific country with 
        longstanding ties and shared values and interests with the 
        Pacific Islands, including through the Compacts of Free 
        Association with the Freely Associated States, the Republic of 
        the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and 
        the Republic of Palau.
            (3) The United States has vital national security interests 
        in the Pacific Islands, including--
                    (A) protecting regional peace and security that 
                fully respects the sovereignty of all nations;
                    (B) advancing economic prosperity free from 
                coercion through trade and sustainable development; and
                    (C) supporting democracy, good governance, the rule 
                of law, and human rights and fundamental freedoms.
            (4) Successive United States administrations have 
        recognized the importance of the Pacific region, including the 
        Pacific Islands, in high-level strategic documents, including 
        the following:
                    (A) The 2015 National Security Strategy, which 
                first declared the rebalance to Asia and the Pacific, 
                affirmed the United States as a Pacific nation, and 
                paved the way for subsequent United States engagement 
                with the Pacific Islands, including several new 
                policies focused on conservation and resilience to 
                climate change announced in September 2016.
                    (B) The 2017 National Security Strategy, which 
                includes a commitment to ``shore up fragile partner 
                states in the Pacific Islands region to reduce their 
                vulnerability to economic fluctuations and natural 
                disasters''.
                    (C) The 2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, which 
                identified the Pacific Islands as ``critical to U.S. 
                strategy because of our shared values, interests, and 
                commitments'' and committed the United States to 
                ``building capacity and resilience to address maritime 
                security; Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated fishing; 
                drug trafficking; and resilience to address climate 
                change and disaster response''.
            (5) The United States has deepened its diplomatic 
        engagement with the Pacific Islands through several recent 
        initiatives, including--
                    (A) the Pacific Pledge, which provided an 
                additional $100,000,000 in 2019 and $200,000,000 in 
                2020, on top of the approximately $350,000,000 that the 
                United States provides annually to the region to 
                support shared priorities in economic and human 
                development, climate change, and more; and
                    (B) the Small and Less Populous Island Economies 
                (SALPIE) Initiative launched in March 2021 to 
                strengthen United States collaboration with island 
                countries and territories, including in the Pacific 
                Islands, on COVID-19 economic challenges, long-term 
                economic development, climate change, and other shared 
                interests.
            (6) The Boe Declaration on Regional Security, signed by 
        leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in 2018, affirmed that 
        climate change ``remains the single greatest threat to the 
        livelihoods, security, and wellbeing of the peoples of the 
        Pacific'' and asserted ``the sovereign right of every Member to 
        conduct its national affairs free of external interference and 
        coercion''.
            (7) The Asian Development Bank has estimated that the 
        Pacific Islands region needs upwards of $2.8 billion a year in 
        investment needs through 2030, in addition to $300 million a 
        year for climate mitigation and adaptation over the same 
        period.
            (8) The Pacific Islands swiftly enacted effective policies 
        to prevent and contain the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 
        2019 (commonly referred to as ``COVID-19'') pandemic to their 
        populations. The United States has provided over $130,000,000 
        in assistance to the Pacific Islands for their COVID-19 
        response. However, priorities must be met to ensure continued 
        success in preventing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        achieving swift and widespread vaccinations, and pursuing long-
        term economic recovery in the Pacific Islands, including 
        through--
                    (A) expanding testing capacity and acquisition of 
                needed medical supplies, including available COVID-19 
                vaccines and supporting vaccination efforts, through a 
                reliable supply chain;
                    (B) planning for lifting of lockdowns and reopening 
                of economic and social activities; and
                    (C) mitigating and recovering from the impacts of 
                the COVID-19 pandemic on the health system and the 
                reliance on food and energy imports as well as lost 
                tourism revenue and other economic and food security 
                damages caused by the pandemic.
            (9) Since 1966, thousands of Peace Corps volunteers have 
        proudly served in the Pacific Islands, building strong people-
        to-people relationships and demonstrating the United States 
        commitment to peace and development in the region. Prior to the 
        COVID-19 pandemic, the Peace Corps maintained presence in four 
        countries of the Pacific Islands. Peace Corps volunteers 
        continue to be in high demand in the Pacific Islands and have 
        been requested across the region.

                security challenges and an assessment of opportunities 
                for the United States to participate in such efforts, 
                including by allocating staff and supplying resourcing;
                    (J) measures to evaluate success for the strategy; 
                and
                    (K) a detailed assessment of appropriations 
                required to achieve the objectives for the strategy in 
                future years.

SEC. 299H. PEACE CORPS IN THE PACIFIC ISLANDS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the presence of the Peace Corps in the Pacific Islands 
        should be expanded and the Peace Corps should reopen its 
        programs in as many of the Pacific Islands as possible, 
        including where it has previously operated but has suspended 
        operations;
            (2) consulting like-minded regional allies and partners, 
        such as Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Taiwan is crucial 
        for identifying and overcoming challenges for increased Peace 
        Corps presence in the Pacific Islands;
            (3) the Peace Corps, whose mission is to promote world 
        peace and friendship in part by helping the people of 
        interested countries in meeting their need for trained men and 
        women, provides an invaluable opportunity to connect the 
        American people with the people of the Republic of the Marshall 
        Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic 
        of Palau; and
            (4) the Peace Corps should promptly reopen its programs in 
        the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of 
        Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Peace Corps shall submit to 
the appropriate congressional committees a report that includes--
            (1) a comparative analysis of the Peace Corps presence in 
        the Pacific Islands region to other regions of the world, 
        including a cost-benefit analysis of placement in the region 
        versus elsewhere globally;
            (2) analysis of current impediments to Peace Corps 
        expansion in the Pacific Islands region;
            (3) outcomes of consultations among United States agencies, 
        and with regional allies and partners, on areas in which 
        cooperation can reduce factors limiting Peace Corps expansion, 
        particularly those related to medical transportation and 
        personal safety; and
            (4) a plan and timeline for implementing outcomes 
        identified in paragraph (3) to facilitate expansion of Peace 
        Corps presence in the region, where appropriate.

                   TITLE III--INVESTING IN OUR VALUES

SEC. 301. STATEMENT OF CONGRESS ON THE CONTINUED VIOLATION OF RIGHTS 
              AND FREEDOMS OF THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Despite international condemnation, the Government of 
        the People's Republic of China (``PRC'') continues to disregard 
        its international legal obligations under the Joint Declaration 
        of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
        Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China on the Question of Hong Kong (``Joint Declaration''), in 
        which the PRC committed that--
                    (A) Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of 
                autonomy;
                    (B) for at least 50 years the ``social and economic 
                systems in Hong Kong'' would remain unchanged; and
                    (C) the personal rights and freedoms of the people 
                of Hong Kong would be protected by law.
            (2) As part of its continued efforts to undermine the 
        established rights of the Hong Kong people, the PRC National 
        People's Congress Standing Committee (``Standing Committee'') 
        passed and imposed upon Hong Kong oppressive and intentionally 
        vague national security legislation on June 30, 2020, that 
        grants Beijing sweeping powers to punish acts of ``separating 
        the country, subverting state power, and organizing terroristic 
        activities''.
            (3) The legislative process by which the Standing Committee 
        imposed the national security law on Hong Kong bypassed Hong 
        Kong's local government in a potential violation of the Basic 
        Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
        People's Republic of China (``Basic Law''), and involved 
        unusual secrecy, as demonstrated by the fact that the 
        legislation was only the second law since 2008 that the 
        Standing Committee has passed without releasing a draft for 
        public comment.
            (4) On July 30, 2020, election officials of the Hong Kong 
        Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) disqualified twelve pro-
        democracy candidates from participating in the September 6 
        Legislative Council elections, which were subsequently 
        postponed for a year until September 5, 2021, by citing the 
        public health risk of holding elections during the COVID-19 
        pandemic.
            (5) On July 31, 2020, in an attempt to assert 
        extraterritorial jurisdiction, the HKSAR Government announced 
        indictments of and arrest warrants for six Hong Kong activists 
        living overseas, including United States citizen Samuel Chu, 
        for alleged violations of the national security law.
            (6) On November 11, 2020, the HKSAR Government removed four 
        lawmakers from office for allegedly violating the law after the 
        Standing Committee passed additional legislation barring those 
        who promoted or supported Hong Kong independence and refused to 
        acknowledge PRC sovereignty over Hong Kong, or otherwise 
        violates the national security law, from running for or serving 
        in the Legislative Council.
            (7) On December 2, 2020, pro-democracy activists Joshua 
        Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam were sentenced to prison for 
        participating in 2019 protests.
            (8) Ten of the twelve Hong Kong residents (also known as 
        ``the Hong Kong 12'') who sought to flee by boat from Hong Kong 
        to Taiwan on August 23, 2020, were taken to mainland China and 
        sentenced on December 30, 2020, to prison terms ranging from 
        seven months to three years for illegal border crossing.
            (9) On December 31, 2020, Hong Kong's highest court revoked 
        bail for Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying, a pro-democracy figure and 
        publisher, who was charged on December 12 with colluding with 
        foreign forces and endangering national security under the 
        national security legislation.
            (10) On January 4, 2021, the Departments of Justice in 
        Henan and Sichuan province threatened to revoke the licenses of 
        two lawyers hired to help the Hong Kong 12.
            (11) On January 5, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force 
        arrested more than fifty opposition figures, including pro-
        democracy officials, activists, and an American lawyer, for 
        their involvement in an informal July 2020 primary to select 
        candidates for the general election originally scheduled for 
        September 2020, despite other political parties having held 
        similar primaries without retribution.
            (12) On April 22, 2021, a Hong Kong court convicted Choy 
        Yuk-ling, a video producer with Radio Television Hong Kong, in 
        relation to her investigative reporting on the Hong Kong 
        police.
            (13) On June 24, 2021, Apple Daily, Hong Kong's only 
        surviving pro-democracy newspaper, published its final edition 
        following months of intimidation and repression by the HKSAR 
        Government, including through the arrest of its senior editors, 
        police raids on its offices, and the freezing of its financial 
        assets.
    (b) Statement of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) condemns the actions taken by the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China (``PRC'') and the Government of the 
        Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (``HKSAR''), including 
        the adoption and implementation of national security 
        legislation for Hong Kong through irregular procedures, that 
        violate the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong that 
        are guaranteed by the Joint Declaration and its implementing 
        document, the Basic Law;
            (2) reaffirms its support for the people of Hong Kong, who 
        face grave threats to their rights and freedoms;
            (3) calls on the Governments of the PRC and HKSAR to--
                    (A) respect and uphold--
                            (i) commitments made to the international 
                        community and the people of Hong Kong under the 
                        Joint Declaration; and
                            (ii) the judicial independence of the Hong 
                        Kong legal system; and
                    (B) release pro-democracy activists and politicians 
                arrested under the national security law; and
            (4) encourages the President, the Secretary of State, and 
        the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate with allies and 
        partners and continue United States efforts to respond to 
        developments in Hong Kong, including by--
                    (A) providing protection for Hong Kong residents 
                who fear persecution;
                    (B) supporting those who may seek to file a case 
                before the International Court of Justice to hold the 
                Government of the PRC accountable for violating its 
                binding legal commitments under the Joint Declaration;
                    (C) encouraging allies and partner countries to 
                instruct, as appropriate, their respective 
                representatives to the United Nations to use their 
                voice, vote, and influence to press for the appointment 
                of a United Nations special mandate holder to monitor 
                and report on human rights developments in Hong Kong;
                    (D) ensuring the private sector, particularly 
                United States companies with economic interests in Hong 
                Kong, is aware of risks the national security 
                legislation poses to the security of United States 
                citizens and to the medium and long-term interest of 
                United States businesses in Hong Kong;
                    (E) continuing to implement sanctions authorities, 
                especially authorities recently enacted to address 
                actions undermining the rights and freedoms of the Hong 
                Kong people, such as the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (Public 
                Law 116-149) and the Hong Kong Human Rights and 
                Democracy Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-76), with respect 
                to officials of the Chinese Communist Party, the 
                Government of the PRC, or the Government of the HKSAR 
                who are responsible for undermining such rights and 
                freedoms; and
                    (F) coordinating with allies and partners to ensure 
                that such implementation of sanctions is multilateral.

        National Security Law'' means the Law of the People's Republic 
        of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong

        Jinping on June 30, 2020, and promulgated in the Hong Kong

                    (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the 
                Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Hong Kong National Security Law promulgated on July 
        1, 2020--
                    (A) contravenes the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
                Special Administrative Region (referred to in this Act 
                as ``the Basic Law'') that provides in Article 23 that 
                the Legislative Council of Hong Kong shall enact 
                legislation related to national security;
                    (B) violates the PRC's commitments under 
                international law, as defined by the Joint Declaration; 
                and
                    (C) causes severe and irreparable damage to the 
                ``one country, two systems'' principle and further 
                erodes global confidence in the PRC's commitment to 
                international law.
            (2) On July 14, 2020, in response to the promulgation of 
        the Hong Kong National Security Law, President Trump signed an 
        Executive order on Hong Kong normalization that, among other 
        policy actions, suspended the special treatment of Hong Kong 
        persons under U.S. law with respect to the issuance of 
        immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.
            (3) The United States has a long and proud history as a 
        destination for refugees and asylees fleeing persecution based 
        on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or 
        membership in a particular social group.
            (4) The United States also shares deep social, cultural, 
        and economic ties with the people of Hong Kong, including a 
        shared commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to the 
        protection of human rights.
            (5) The United States has sheltered, protected, and 
        welcomed individuals who have fled authoritarian regimes, 
        including citizens from the PRC following the violent June 4, 
        1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square, deepening ties between the 
        people of the United States and those individuals seeking to 
        contribute to a free, open society founded on democracy, human 
        rights, and the respect for the rule of law.
            (6) The United States has reaped enormous economic, 
        cultural, and strategic benefits from welcoming successive 
        generations of scientists, doctors, entrepreneurs, artists, 
        intellectuals, and other freedom-loving people fleeing fascism, 
        communism, violent Islamist extremism, and other repressive 
        ideologies, including in the cases of Nazi Germany, the Soviet 
        Union, and Soviet-controlled Central Europe, Cuba, Vietnam, and 
        Iran.
            (7) A major asymmetric advantage of the United States in 
        its long-term strategic competition with the Communist Party of 
        China is the ability of people from every country in the world, 
        irrespective of their race, ethnicity, or religion, to 
        immigrate to the United States and become American citizens.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in 
        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-
        383), specifically that--
                    (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in 
                the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of 
                Hong Kong'';
                    (B) ``support for democratization is a fundamental 
                principle of United States foreign policy'', and 
                therefore ``naturally applies to United States policy 
                toward Hong Kong'';
                    (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong 
                are of great importance to the United States and are 
                directly relevant to United States interests in Hong 
                Kong and serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued 
                economic prosperity''; and
                    (D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous 
                from the PRC to ``justify treatment under a particular 
                law of the United States, or any provision thereof, 
                different from that accorded the People's Republic of 
                China'';
            (2) to continue to support the high degree of autonomy and 
        fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as 
        enumerated by--
                    (A) the Joint Declaration;
                    (B) the International Covenant on Civil and 
                Political Rights, done at New York, December 19, 1966; 
                and
                    (C) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done 
                at Paris, December 10, 1948;
            (3) to continue to support the democratic aspirations of 
        the people of Hong Kong, including the ``ultimate aim'' of the 
        selection of the Chief Executive and all members of the 
        Legislative Council by universal suffrage, as articulated in 
        the Basic Law;
            (4) to urge the Government of the PRC, despite its recent 
        actions, to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong, including 
        allowing the people of Hong Kong to govern Hong Kong with a 
        high degree of autonomy and without undue interference, and 
        ensuring that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right to elect 
        the Chief Executive and all members of the Hong Kong 
        Legislative Council by universal suffrage;
            (5) to support the establishment of a genuine democratic 
        option to freely and fairly nominate and elect the Chief 
        Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment of open and 
        direct democratic elections for all members of the Hong Kong 
        Legislative Council;
            (6) to support the robust exercise by residents of Hong 
        Kong of the rights to free speech, the press, and other 
        fundamental freedoms, as provided by the Basic Law, the Joint 
        Declaration, and the International Covenant on Civil and 
        Political Rights;
            (7) to support freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, 
        detention, or imprisonment for all Hong Kong residents, as 
        provided by the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;
            (8) to draw international attention to any violations by 
        the Government of the PRC of the fundamental rights of the 
        people of Hong Kong, as provided by the International Covenant 
        on Civil and Political Rights, and any encroachment upon the 
        autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong by the Basic Law and the Joint 
        Declaration;
            (9) to protect United States citizens and long-term 
        permanent residents living in Hong Kong, as well as people 
        visiting and transiting through Hong Kong;
            (10) to maintain the economic and cultural ties that 
        provide significant benefits to both the United States and Hong 
        Kong, including the reinstatement of the Fulbright exchange 
        program with regard to Hong Kong at the earliest opportunity;
            (11) to coordinate with allies, including the United 
        Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, 
        to promote democracy and human rights in Hong Kong; and
            (12) to welcome and protect in the United States residents 
        of Hong Kong fleeing persecution or otherwise seeking a safe 
        haven from violations by the Government of the PRC of the 
        fundamental rights of the people of Hong Kong.

                of the PRC following the enactment of the Hong Kong 
                National Security Law that places certain Hong Kong 
                persons at risk of persecution; and
                    (B) to encourage like-minded nations to make 
                similar accommodations for Hong Kong people fleeing

        a fear and a credible basis for concern about the possibility

                may designate other categories of aliens for purposes 
                of establishing a well-founded fear of persecution

                persecution in the PRC on account of race, religion,

                        more individuals arrested for participating in 
                        such protests; or
                            (v) a participant who during the period 
                        beginning on June 9, 2019, and ending on June 
                        30, 2020, was arrested, charged, detained, or 
                        convicted as a result of such participation.
            (3) Age out protections.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        a determination of whether an alien is a child shall be made

        refugee or asylum status in which the alien is a named 
        beneficiary is filed with the Secretary of Homeland Security.
            (4) Exclusion from numerical limitations.--Aliens provided

                203(b)(4) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)(4));
                    (B) is otherwise eligible to receive an immigrant

                    (C) is otherwise admissible to the United States

                inadmissibility specified in section 212(a)(4) of such 
                Act (8 U.S.C. (a)(4))); and

                screening, as determined by the Secretary of Homeland 
                Security.
            (2) Aliens described.--
                    (A) Principal aliens.--An alien is described in 
                this subsection if--
                            (i) the alien--
                                    (I) is a Priority Hong Kong 
                                Resident; and
                                    (II) has earned a bachelor's or 
                                higher degree from an institution of 
                                higher education; and
                            (ii) the Secretary of Homeland Security 
                        determines that such alien's relocation to the

                        benefit to the United States.
                    (B) Spouses and children.--An alien is described in 
                this subsection if the alien is the spouse or child of 
                a principal alien described in paragraph (1).
            (3) Numerical limitations.--
                    (A) In general.--The total number of principal 
                aliens who may be provided special immigrant status 
                under this section may not exceed 5,000 per year for 
                each of the five fiscal years beginning after the date 
                of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Homeland 
                Security may, in consultation with the Secretary of 
                State, prioritize the issuance of visas to individuals 
                with a bachelor's or higher degree in science, 
                technology, engineering, mathematics, medicine, or 
                health care.
                    (B) Exclusion from numerical limitations.--Aliens 
                provided immigrant status under this section shall not 
                be counted against any numerical limitation under 
                section 201, 202, 203, or 207 of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151, 1152, 1153, and 1157).
            (4) Eligibility for admission under other classification.--
        No alien shall be denied the opportunity to apply for admission 
        under this section solely because such alien qualifies as an 
        immediate relative or is eligible for any other immigrant 
        classification.
            (5) Timeline for processing applications.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary of State and the

                including required screenings and background checks, 
                are completed not later than one year after the date on 
                which an eligible applicant submits an application 
                under subsection (a).
                    (B) Exception.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the 
                relevant Federal agencies may take additional time to 
                process applications described in paragraph (1) if 
                satisfaction of national security concerns requires 
                such additional time, provided that the Secretary of 
                Homeland Security, or the designee of the Secretary, 
                has determined that the applicant meets the 
                requirements for status as a special immigrant under 
                this section and has so notified the applicant.
    (k) Termination.--Except as provided in section 6 of this Act, this

SEC. 304. EXPORT PROHIBITION OF MUNITIONS ITEMS TO THE HONG KONG POLICE 
              FORCE.

    Section 3 of the Act entitled ``An Act to prohibit the commercial 
export of covered munitions items to the Hong Kong Police Force'', 
approved November 27, 2019 (Public Law 116-77; 133 Stat. 1173), is 
amended by striking ``on December 31, 2021.'' and inserting the 
following: ``on the date on which the President certifies to the

            ``(1) the Secretary of State has, on or after the date of 
        the enactment of this paragraph, certified under section 205 of 
        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 that Hong Kong 
        warrants treatment under United States law in the same manner 
        as United States laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1, 
        1997;
            ``(2) the Hong Kong Police have not engaged in gross 
        violations of human rights during the 1-year period ending on 
        the date of such certification; and
            ``(3) there has been an independent examination of human 
        rights concerns related to the crowd control tactics of the 
        Hong Kong Police and the Government of the Hong Kong Special 
        Administrative Region has adequately addressed those 
        concerns.''.

SEC. 305. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TREATMENT OF UYGHURS AND OTHER ETHNIC 
              MINORITIES IN THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Uyghurs are one of several predominantly Muslim 
        Turkic groups living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
        (XUAR) in the northwest of the People's Republic of China 
        (PRC).
            (2) Following Uyghur demonstrations and unrest in 2009 and 
        clashes with government security personnel and other violent 
        incidents in subsequent years, PRC leaders sought to 
        ``stabilize'' the XUAR through large-scale arrests and extreme 
        security measures, under the pretext of combatting alleged 
        terrorism, religious extremism, and ethnic separatism.
            (3) In May 2014, the PRC launched its ``Strike Hard Against 
        Violent Extremism'' campaign, which placed further restrictions 
        on and facilitated additional human rights violations against 
        minorities in the XUAR under the pretext of fighting terrorism.
            (4) In August 2016, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo 
        member Chen Quanguo, former Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Party 
        Secretary, known for overseeing intensifying security 
        operations and human rights abuses in the TAR, was appointed as 
        Party Secretary of the XUAR.
            (5) Beginning in 2017, XUAR authorities have sought to 
        forcibly ``assimilate'' Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities 
        into Chinese society through a policy of cultural erasure known 
        as ``Sinicization''.
            (6) Since 2018, credible reporting including from the BBC, 
        France24, and the New York Times has shown that the Government 
        of the PRC has built mass internment camps in the XUAR, which 
        it calls ``vocational training'' centers, and detained Uyghurs 
        and other groups in them and other facilities.
            (7) Since 2015, XUAR authorities have arbitrarily detained 
        an estimated 1,500,000 Uyghurs--12.5 percent of the XUAR's 
        official Uyghur population of 12,000,000--and a smaller number 
        of other ethnic minorities in the ``vocational training'' 
        centers and other detention and pre-detention facilities.
            (8) In 2017, the XUAR accounted for less than two percent 
        of the PRC's total population but 21 percent of all arrests in 
        China.
            (9) The Atlantic, Radio Free Asia, and other sources have 
        revealed that detainees are forced to renounce many of their 
        Islamic beliefs and customs and repudiate Uyghur culture, 
        language, and identity.
            (10) Investigations by Human Rights Watch and other human 
        rights organizations have documented how detainees are subject 
        to political indoctrination, forced labor, crowded and 
        unsanitary conditions, involuntary biometric data collection, 
        both medical neglect and intrusive medical interventions, food 
        and water deprivation, beatings, sexual violence, and torture.
            (11) Research by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute 
        suggests that, since late 2019, many detainees have been placed 
        in higher security facilities and convicted of formal crimes.
            (12) Human Rights Watch has reported that the PRC uses data 
        collection programs, including facial recognition technology, 
        to surveil Uyghurs in the XUAR and to identify individuals whom 
        authorities may detain.
            (13) PRC authorities have placed countless children whose 
        parents are detained or in exile in state-run institutions and 
        boarding schools without the consent of their parents.
            (14) New York Times reporting revealed that numerous local 
        PRC officials who did not agree with the policies carried out 
        in XUAR have been fired and imprisoned.
            (15) Associated Press reporting documented widespread and 
        systemic efforts by PRC authorities to force Uyghur women to 
        take contraceptives or to subject them to sterilization or 
        abortion, threatening to detain those who do not comply.
            (16) PRC authorities prohibit family members and advocates 
        inside and outside China from having regular communications 
        with relatives and friends imprisoned in the XUAR, such as 
        journalist and entrepreneur Ekpar Asat.
            (17) PRC authorities have imposed pervasive restrictions on 
        the peaceful practice of Islam in the XUAR, to the extent that 
        Human Rights Watch asserts the PRC ``has effectively outlawed 
        the practice of Islam''.
            (18) Individuals who are not detained in camps have been 
        forced to attend political indoctrination sessions, subjected 
        to movement restrictions, mass surveillance systems, 
        involuntary biometric data collection, and other human rights 
        abuses.
            (19) International media, nongovernmental organizations, 
        scholars, families, and survivors have reported on the systemic 
        nature of many of these abuses.
            (20) On June 26, 2020, a group of 50 independent United 
        Nations experts jointly expressed alarm over China's 
        deteriorating human rights record, including its repression in 
        Xinjiang, and called on the international community ``to act 
        collectively and decisively to ensure China respects human 
        rights and abides by its international obligations''.
            (21) On October 6, 2020, 39 United Nations member countries 
        issued a public statement condemning human rights violations by 
        PRC authorities and calling on the PRC to allow the United 
        Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights unfettered access to 
        Xinjiang.
            (22) The United States Congress passed the Uyghur Human 
        Rights Policy Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-145).
            (23) The United States Congress passed the Global Magnitsky 
        Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
        Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), which has been used 
        to sanction PRC officials and entities for their activities in 
        the XUAR.
            (24) The United States Government has implemented 
        additional targeted restrictions on trade with Xinjiang and 
        imposed visa and economic sanctions on PRC officials and 
        entities for their activities in the XUAR.
            (25) The United States Government has documented human 
        rights abuses and violations of individual freedoms in the 
        XUAR, including in the 2019 Department of State Report on 
        International Religious Freedom.
            (26) On January 19, 2021, during his confirmation hearing, 
        Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified that ``forcing men, 
        women, and children into concentration camps, trying to in 
        effect reeducate them to be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
        Party--all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide''.
            (27) On January 19, 2021, Secretary of the Treasury Janet 
        L. Yellen, during her confirmation hearing, publicly stated 
        that China is guilty of ``horrendous human rights abuses''.
            (28) On January 27, 2021, in response to a question from 
        the press regarding the Uyghurs, Secretary Blinken stated that 
        his ``judgement remains that genocide was committed against the 
        Uyghurs''.
            (29) On March 10, 2021, in response to a question on 
        Xinjiang during his testimony before the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary Blinken 
        reiterated, ``We`ve been clear, and I've been clear, that I see 
        it as genocide, other egregious abuses of human rights, and 
        we'll continue to make that clear.''.
            (30) The 2020 Department of State Country Reports on Human 
        Rights Practices: China states that ``[g]enocide and crimes 
        against humanity occurred during the year against the 
        predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
        minority groups in Xinjiang''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the atrocities committed by the PRC against Uyghurs and 
        other predominantly Muslim Turkic groups in Xinjiang, including 
        forced labor, sexual violence, the internment of over 1,000,000 
        individuals, and other horrific abuses must be condemned;
            (2) the President, the Secretary of State, and the United 
        States Ambassador to the United Nations should speak publicly 
        about the ongoing human rights abuses in the XUAR, including in 
        formal speeches at the United Nations and other international 
        fora;
            (3) the President, the Secretary of State, and the United 
        States Ambassador to the United Nations should appeal to the 
        United Nations Secretary-General to take a more proactive and 
        public stance on the situation in the XUAR, including by 
        supporting calls for an investigation and accountability for 
        individuals and entities involved in abuses against the people 
        of the XUAR;
            (4) the United States should continue to use targeted 
        sanctions and all diplomatic tools available to hold those 
        responsible for the atrocities in Xinjiang to account;
            (5) United States agencies engaged with China on trade, 
        climate, defense, or other bilateral issues should include 
        human rights abuses in the XUAR as a consideration in 
        developing United States policy;
            (6) the United States supports Radio Free Asia Uyghur, the 
        only Uyghur-language news service in the world independent of 
        Chinese government influence; and
            (7) the United States recognizes the repeated requests from 
        the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
        unfettered access to the XUAR and the PRC's refusal to comply, 
        and therefore--
                    (A) PRC authorities must allow unfettered access by 
                the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
                Human Rights to the XUAR;
                    (B) the United States should urge collaborative 
                action between the United States Government and 
                international partners to pressure PRC authorities to 
                allow unfettered access to the XUAR;
                    (C) the President, the Secretary of State, and the 
                United States Ambassador to the United Nations should 
                simultaneously outline a strategy to investigate the 
                human rights abuses and crimes that have taken place in 
                the XUAR, collect evidence, and transfer the evidence 
                to a competent court; and
                    (D) United States partners and allies should 
                undertake similar strategies in an effort to build an 
                international investigation outside of the PRC if PRC 
                authorities do not comply with a United Nations 
                investigation in the XUAR.

SEC. 306. PREVENTION OF UYGHUR FORCED LABOR.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to prohibit the import of all goods, wares, articles, 
        or merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured, wholly or in 
        part, by forced labor from the People's Republic of China and 
        particularly any such goods, wares, articles, or merchandise 
        produced in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (commonly 
        referred to as ``Xinjiang'' or ``XUAR'') of China;
            (2) to encourage the international community to reduce the 
        import of any goods made with forced labor from the People's 
        Republic of China, particularly goods mined, manufactured, or 
        produced in the XUAR;
            (3) to coordinate with Mexico and Canada to effectively 
        implement Article 23.6 of the United States-Mexico-Canada 
        Agreement to prohibit the importation of goods produced in 
        whole or in part by forced or compulsory labor, which includes 
        goods produced in whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
        labor in the People's Republic of China;
            (4) to actively work to prevent, publicly denounce, and end 
        human trafficking as a horrific assault on human dignity and to 
        restore the lives of those affected by human trafficking, a 
        modern form of slavery;
            (5) to regard the prevention of atrocities as in its 
        national interest, including efforts to prevent torture, 
        enforced disappearances, severe deprivation of liberty, 
        including mass internment, arbitrary detention, and widespread 
        and systematic use of forced labor, and persecution targeting 
        any identifiable ethnic or religious group; and
            (6) to address gross violations of human rights in the XUAR 
        through bilateral diplomatic channels and multilateral 
        institutions where both the United States and the People's 
        Republic of China are members and with all the authorities 
        available to the United States Government, including visa and 
        financial sanctions, export restrictions, and import controls.
    (b) Prohibition on Importation of Goods Made in the XUAR.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), all 
        goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or 
        manufactured wholly or in part in the XUAR of China, or by 
        persons working with the XUAR government for purposes of the 
        ``poverty alleviation'' program or the ``pairing-assistance'' 
        program which subsidizes the establishment of manufacturing 
        facilities in the XUAR, shall be deemed to be goods, wares, 
        articles, and merchandise described in section 307 of the 
        Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) and shall not be entitled 
        to entry at any of the ports of the United States.
            (2) Exception.--The prohibition described in paragraph (1) 
        shall not apply if the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection--
                    (A) determines, by clear and convincing evidence, 
                that any specific goods, wares, articles, or 
                merchandise described in paragraph (1) were not 
                produced wholly or in part by convict labor, forced 
                labor, or indentured labor under penal sanctions; and
                    (B) submits to the appropriate congressional 
                committees and makes available to the public a report 
                that contains such determination.

        the enactment of this Act, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task 
        Force, established under section 741 of the United States-
        Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (19 U.S.C. 4681), 
        shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a 
        report that contains an enforcement strategy to effectively 
        address forced labor in the XUAR of China or products made by

        persecuted groups through forced labor in any other part of the 
        People's Republic of China. The enforcement strategy shall 
        describe the specific enforcement plans of the United States 
        Government regarding--
                    (A) goods, wares, articles, and merchandise 
                described in subsection (b)(1) that are imported into 
                the United States directly from the XUAR or made by 
                Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, or members of other

                the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for 
                purposes of the ``poverty alleviation'' program or the 
                ``pairing-assistance'' program; and
                    (C) goods, wares, articles, and merchandise 
                described in subsection (b)(1) that are imported into

            (2) Matters to be included.--The strategy required by 
        paragraph (1) shall include the following:

    (d) Determination Relating to Crimes Against Humanity or Genocide

                members of other Muslim minority groups in the XUAR of 
                China can be considered systematic and widespread and 
                therefore constitutes crimes against humanity or 
                constitutes genocide as defined in subsection (a) of 
                section 1091 of title 18, United States Code; and
                    (B) submit to the appropriate congressional

                end forced labor of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and 
                members of other Muslim minority groups in the XUAR;
                    (B) public affairs, public diplomacy, and counter-

            (7) Termination of sanctions.--The President may terminate 
        the application of sanctions under this section with respect to 
        a foreign person if the President determines and reports to the

                imposed;

    (g) Disclosures to the Securities and Exchange Commission of 
Certain Activities Related to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.--
            (1) Policy statement.--It is the policy of the United 
        States to protect American investors, through stronger 
        disclosure requirements, alerting them to the presence of 
        Chinese and other companies complicit in gross violations of 
        human rights in United States capital markets, including 
        American and foreign companies listed on United States 
        exchanges that enable the mass internment and population 
        surveillance of Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and other Muslim 
        minorities and source products made with forced labor in the 
        XUAR. Such involvements represent clear, material risks to the 
        share values and corporate reputations of certain of these 
        companies and hence to prospective American investors, 
        particularly given that the United States Government has 
        employed sanctions and export restrictions to target 
        individuals and entities contributing to human rights abuses in 
        the People's Republic of China.
            (2) Disclosure of certain activities relating to the 
        xinjiang uyghur autonomous region.--Section 13 of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) is amended by 
        adding at the end the following new subsection:

SEC. 307. UYGHUR HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Uyghur Human 
Rights Protection Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
        has a long history of repressing Turkic Muslims and other 
        Muslim minority groups, particularly Uyghurs, in the Xinjiang 
        Uyghur Autonomous Region (commonly referred to as ``Xinjiang'' 
        or ``XUAR''), also known as East Turkestan. Central and 
        regional PRC government policies have systematically 
        discriminated against these minority groups by denying them a 
        range of civil and political rights, particularly freedom of 
        religion. Senior Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials bear 
        direct responsibility for these gross human rights violations.
            (2) PRC government abuses include the arbitrary detention 
        of more than 1,000,000 Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and 
        members of other Muslim minority groups, separation of working 
        age adults from their children and elderly parents, and the 
        integration of forced labor into supply chains. Those held in 
        detention facilities and internment camps in the XUAR have 
        described forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings, 
        food deprivation, sexual assault, coordinated campaigns to 
        reduce birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims 
        through forced sterilization, and denial of religious, 
        cultural, and linguistic freedoms. Recent media reports 
        indicate that since 2019, the PRC government has newly 
        constructed, expanded, or fortified at least 60 detention 
        facilities with higher security or prison-like features in 
        Xinjiang.
            (3) The PRC government's actions against Uyghurs, ethnic 
        Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups in 
        the XUAR violate international human rights laws and norms, 
        including--
                    (A) the International Convention on the Elimination 
                of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, to which the PRC 
                has acceded;
                    (B) the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
                Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the 
                PRC has signed and ratified;
                    (C) The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment 
                of the Crime of Genocide, which the PRC has signed and 
                ratified;
                    (D) the International Covenant on Civil and 
                Political Rights, which the PRC has signed; and
                    (E) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
                the International Labor Organization's Force Labor 
                Convention (no. 29) and the Abolition of Forced Labor 
                Convention (no. 105).
    (c) Refugee Protections for Certain Residents of the XUAR.--
            (1) Populations of special humanitarian concern.--The 
        Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of 
        Homeland Security, shall designate, as Priority 2 refugees of 
        special humanitarian concern--
                    (A) aliens who were nationals of the PRC and 
                residents of the XUAR on January 1, 2021;
                    (B) aliens who fled the XUAR after June 30, 2009, 
                and reside in other provinces of the PRC or in a third 
                country where such alien is not firmly resettled; and
                    (C) the spouses, children, and parents (as such 
                terms are defined in subsections (a) and (b) of section 
                101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
                1101)) of individuals described in subparagraphs (A) 
                and (B), except that a child shall be an unmarried 
                person under 27 years of age.
            (2) Processing of xuar refugees.--The processing of 
        individuals described in paragraph (1) for classification as 
        refugees may occur in the PRC or a third country.

                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157) or asylum under section 
                208 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1158), that such alien has a 
                well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, 
                religion, nationality, membership in a particular 
                social group, or political opinion by asserting such a 
                fear and asserting a credible basis for concern about 
                the possibility of such persecution.
                    (B) Aliens described.--An alien is described in 
                this subsection if such alien has been identified as a 
                person of special humanitarian concern pursuant to 
                paragraph (1) and--
                            (i) has experienced persecution in the XUAR 
                        by the PRC government, including--
                                    (I) forced and arbitrary detention 
                                including in an internment or re-
                                education camp;
                                    (II) forced political 
                                indoctrination, torture, beatings, food 
                                deprivation, and denial of religious, 
                                cultural, and linguistic freedoms;
                                    (III) forced labor;
                                    (IV) forced separation from family 
                                members;

                                    (VI) has been formally charged, 
                                detained, or convicted on account of 
                                their peaceful actions as described in 
                                the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 
                                2020 (Public Law 116-145).
                            (ii) is currently a national of the PRC 
                        whose residency in the XUAR, or any other area 
                        within the jurisdiction of the PRC, was revoked 
                        for having submitted to any United States 
                        Government agency a nonfrivolous application 
                        for refugee status, asylum, or any other

                opportunity to apply for admission as a refugee or

                qualifies as an immediate relative of a national of the 
                United States or is eligible for admission to the 
                United States under any other immigrant classification.

SEC. 311. DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF INTERNET FREEDOM AND GREAT 
              FIREWALL CIRCUMVENTION TOOLS FOR THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) has repeatedly 
        violated its obligations under the Joint Declaration by 
        suppressing the basic rights and freedoms of the people of Hong 
        Kong.
            (2) On June 30, 2020, the National People's Congress passed 
        a ``National Security Law'' that further erodes Hong Kong's 
        autonomy and enables authorities to suppress dissent.
            (3) The Government of the PRC continues to utilize the 
        National Security Law to undermine the fundamental rights of 
        the Hong Kong people through suppression of the freedom of 
        speech, assembly, religion, and the press.
            (4) Article 9 of the National Security Law authorizes 
        unprecedented regulation and supervision of internet activity 
        in Hong Kong, including expanded police powers to force 
        internet service providers to censor content, hand over user 
        information, and block access to platforms.
            (5) On January 13, 2021, the Hong Kong Broadband Network 
        blocked public access to HK Chronicles, a website promoting 
        pro-democracy viewpoints, under the authorities of the National 
        Security Law.
            (6) On February 12, 2021, internet service providers 
        blocked access to the Taiwan Transitional Justice Commission 
        website in Hong Kong.
            (7) Major tech companies, including Facebook, Twitter, 
        WhatsApp and Google, have stopped reviewing requests for user 
        data from Hong Kong authorities.
            (8) On February 28, 2021, 47 pro-democracy activists in 
        Hong Kong were arrested and charged under the National Security 
        Law on the charge of ``conspiracy to commit subversion''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should--
            (1) support the ability of the people of Hong Kong to 
        maintain their freedom to access information online; and
            (2) focus on investments in technologies that facilitate 
        the unhindered exchange of information in Hong Kong in advance 
        of any future efforts by the Chinese Communist Party--
                    (A) to suppress internet access;
                    (B) to increase online censorship; or
                    (C) to inhibit online communication and content-

SEC. 314. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND 
              DISCRIMINATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, crimes and 
        discrimination against Asians and those of Asian descent have 
        risen dramatically worldwide. In May 2020, United Nations 
        Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ``the pandemic 
        continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, 
        scapegoating and scare-mongering'' and urged governments to 
        ``act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against 
        the virus of hate''.
            (2) Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) workers make 
        up a large portion of the essential workers on the frontlines 
        of the COVID-19 pandemic, making up 8.5 percent of all 
        essential healthcare workers in the United States. AAPI workers 
        also make up a large share--between 6 percent and 12 percent 
        based on sector--of the biomedical field.
            (3) The United States Census notes that Americans of Asian 
        descent alone made up nearly 5.9 percent of the United States 
        population in 2019, and that Asian Americans are the fastest-
        growing racial group in the United States, projected to 
        represent 14 percent of the United States population by 2065.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the reprehensible attacks on people of Asian descent 
        and concerning increase in anti-Asian sentiment and racism in 
        the United States and around the world have no place in a 
        peaceful, civilized, and tolerant world;
            (2) the United States is a diverse country with a proud 
        tradition of immigration, and the strength and vibrancy of the 
        United States is enhanced by the diverse ethnic backgrounds and 
        tolerance of its citizens, including Asian Americans and 
        Pacific Islanders;
            (3) the United States Government should encourage foreign 
        governments to use the official and scientific names for the 
        COVID-19 pandemic, as recommended by the World Health 
        Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention; and
            (4) the United States Government and other governments 
        around the world must actively oppose racism and intolerance, 
        and use all available and appropriate tools to combat the 
        spread of anti-Asian racism and discrimination.

SEC. 315. ANNUAL REPORTING ON CENSORSHIP OF FREE SPEECH WITH RESPECT TO 
              INTERNATIONAL ABUSES OF HUMAN RIGHTS.

    Section 116(d) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (227 U.S.C. 
2151n(d)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (11)(C), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (12)(C)(ii), by striking the period at the 
        end and inserting a semicolon; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(13) wherever applicable, instances in which the 
        government of each country has attempted to extraterritorially 
        intimidate or pressure a company or entity to censor or self-
        censor the speech of its employees, contractors, customers, or 
        associated staff with regards to the abuse of human rights in 
        such country, or sought retaliation against such employees or 
        contractors for the same, including any instance in which the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China has sought to 
        extraterritorially censor or punish speech that is otherwise 
        legal in the United States on the topics of--
                    ``(A) repression and violation of fundamental 
                freedoms in Hong Kong;
                    ``(B) repression and persecution of religious and 
                ethnic minorities in China, including in the Xinjiang 
                Uyghur Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous 
                Region;
                    ``(C) efforts to proliferate and use surveillance 
                technologies to surveil activists, journalists, 
                opposition politicians, or to profile persons of 
                different ethnicities; and
                    ``(D) other gross violations of human rights; and
            ``(14) wherever applicable, instances in which a company or 
        entity located in or based in a third country has censored or 
        self-censored the speech of its employees, contractors, 
        customers, or associated staff on the topic of abuse of human 
        rights in each country or sought to retaliate against such 
        employees for the same, due to intimidation or pressure from or 
        the fear of intimidation by the foreign government.''.

SEC. 316. POLICY TOWARD THE XXIV OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES AND THE XIII 
              PARALYMPIC WINTER GAMES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In October 2020, 39 countries at the United Nations 
        Third Committee of the General Assembly appealed for action on 
        the mass arbitrary detentions and other crimes against the 
        Uyghur Muslim population of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
        Region.
            (2) The 2018 concluding observations of the United Nations 
        Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination decried 
        reports of mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs.
            (3) Over 400 international nongovernmental organizations 
        have joined together to decry the mass arbitrary detentions of 
        Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
            (4) The Olympic Charter states that the practice of sport 
        ``is a human right'' that ``shall be secured without 
        discrimination of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, sexual 
        orientation, language, religion, political or other opinion, 
        national or social origin, property, birth or other status'', a 
        right that by definition cannot be secured in a country in 
        which over 1,000,000 people are imprisoned in camps because of 
        their race, language, and religion.
            (5) The 2008 Olympics in Beijing were accompanied by 
        widespread tracking, arrest, and intimidation of foreign 
        journalists and bloggers, as well as restrictions on movement 
        of journalists, contrary to explicit commitments made by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) to the 
        International Olympic Committee.
            (6) The Government of the PRC denied visas for some 
        journalists granted press accreditation for the 2008 Olympic 
        Games, and the Beijing Organising Committee of the Olympic 
        Games repeatedly refused to address incidents involving freedom 
        of expression.
            (7) The International Olympic Committee faced broad 
        criticism for failing to adequately anticipate infringements by 
        the Government of the PRC's on freedom of expression and press 
        for international media and 2008 Olympics participants, and 
        failing to hold the Government of the PRC to their own 
        commitments to safeguard human rights during the 2008 games.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
International Olympic Committee should--
            (1) consider that the Olympic Charter's principles of 
        solidarity and nondiscrimination are hard to reconcile with 
        holding the 2022 Winter Games in a country the government of 
        which stands credibly accused of perpetrating crimes against 
        humanity and genocide against ethnic and religious minorities;
            (2) take into account the recent precedent of the 2008 
        games, at which Olympic athletes, spectators, and international 
        media had their fundamental freedoms severely challenged, and 
        the likely limitations the Government of the PRC will seek to 
        enforce on participants speaking out about ongoing persecution 
        of the Uyghurs and other human rights abuses in the PRC, 
        despite repeated commitments by the Government of the PRC;
            (3) emphasize that the International Olympic Committee is 
        not opposed to moving an Olympic competition in all 
        circumstances, and should immediately rebid the 2022 Winter 
        Olympic Games to be hosted by a country that recognizes and 
        respects human rights;
            (4) affirm the International Olympic Committee's--
                    (A) desire to stay above politics does not permit 
                turning a blind eye to mass atrocity crimes, which 
                cannot and should not be dismissed as mere political 
                concerns; and
                    (B) commitment to the fundamental rights 
                instruments of the international system, which are 
                beyond partisan or domestic policy, and upon which the 
                success of the entire Olympic project depends;
            (5) propose a set of clear, executable actions to be taken 
        by the International Olympic Committee upon infringement of 
        freedom of expression by a host country's government during any

              RIGHTS PRACTICES.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State's annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices should include relevant 
information regarding whether a particular country has provided 
assistance to the PRC or any entity under the influence of the Chinese 
Communist Party in its genocide against the Uyghurs, including through 
the forcible repatriation of Uyghurs to the PRC without reasonable 
opportunity for them to be assessed and protected as refugees.

SEC. 323. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PRESS FREEDOM IN THE PEOPLE'S 
              REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the People's Republic of China 
maintains one of the worst media environments in the world and seeks to 
curtail political speech inside and outside the country, including by--
            (1) targeting independent and foreign media in China 
        through systematic harassment including the denial of visas to 
        foreign journalists, imprisonment, the denial of medical care 
        to imprisoned journalists, and curtailing access to legal 
        representation;
            (2) pervasively monitoring and censoring online and social 
        media content, including through the banning of virtual private 
        networks;
            (3) using the full force of the State to stifle internal 
        dissent including dissent online, particularly dissent that 
        could lead to political change and content that criticizes 
        China's leaders, however trivial, reportedly even to the point 
        of censoring comparisons of Xi Jingping's looks with Winnie the 
        Pooh;
            (4) spreading propaganda to foreign audiences through the 
        United Front Work Department and related activities;
            (5) seeking to intimidate American-based journalists 
        working for Radio Free Asia and reporting on gross human rights 
        violations in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region by 
        jailing or otherwise harassing members of their families; and
            (6) championing a ``sovereign Internet'' model and 
        exporting technology to enhance the ability of like-minded 
        authoritarian regimes to suppress dissent online and monitor 
        the activity of their people.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the freedom of the press is an unalienable right that 
        is necessary for citizens to hold their government to account;
            (2) the PRC should cease its repression of journalists, 
        citizen journalists, news organizations; and
            (3) the PRC should cease the censorship of political 
        satire, including comparisons of Xi Jingping's looks with 
        Winnie the Pooh.

             TITLE IV--INVESTING IN OUR ECONOMIC STATECRAFT

SEC. 401. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S 
              INDUSTRIAL POLICY.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the challenges presented by a nonmarket economy like 
        the economy of the People's Republic of China (PRC), which has 
        captured such a large share of global economic exchange, are in 
        many ways unprecedented and require sufficiently elevated and 
        sustained long-term focus and engagement;
            (2) in order to truly address the most detrimental aspects 
        of Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-directed mercantilist economic 
        strategy, the United States must adopt policies that--
                    (A) expose the full scope and scale of intellectual 
                property theft and mass subsidization of Chinese firms, 
                and the resulting harm to the United States, foreign 
                markets, and the global economy;
                    (B) ensure that PRC companies face costs and 
                consequences for anticompetitive behavior;
                    (C) provide options for affected United States 
                persons to address and respond to unreasonable and 
                discriminatory CCP-directed industrial policies; and
                    (D) strengthen the protection of critical 
                technology and sensitive data, while still fostering an 
                environment that provides incentives for secure but 
                open investment, innovation, and competition;
            (3) the United States must work with its allies and 
        partners and multilateral venues and fora--
                    (A) to reinforce long-standing generally accepted 
                principles of fair competition and market behavior and 
                address the PRC's anticompetitive economic and 
                industrial policies that undermine decades of global 
                growth and innovation;
                    (B) to ensure that the PRC is not granted the same 
                treatment as that of a free-market economy until it 
                ceases the implementation of laws, regulations, 
                policies, and practices that provide unfair advantage 
                to PRC firms in furtherance of national objectives and 
                impose unreasonable, discriminatory, and illegal 
                burdens on market-based international commerce; and
                    (C) to align policies with respect to curbing 
                state-directed subsidization of the private sector, 
                such as advocating for global rules related to 
                transparency and adherence to notification 
                requirements, including through the efforts currently 
                being advanced by the United States, Japan, and the 
                European Union;
            (4) the United States and its allies and partners must 
        collaborate to provide incentives to their respective companies 
        to cooperate in areas such as--
                    (A) advocating for protection of intellectual 
                property rights in markets around the world;
                    (B) fostering open technical standards; and
                    (C) increasing joint investments in overseas 
                markets; and
            (5) the United States should develop policies that--
                    (A) insulate United States entities from PRC 
                pressure against complying with United States laws;
                    (B) together with the work of allies and partners 
                and multilateral institutions, counter the potential 
                impact of the blocking regime of the PRC established by 
                the Ministry of Commerce of the PRC on January 9, 2021, 
                when it issued Order No. 1 of 2021, entitled ``Rules on 
                Counteracting Unjustified Extraterritorial Application 
                of Foreign Legislation and other Measures''; and
                    (C) plan for future actions that the Government of 
                the PRC may take to undermine the lawful application of 
                United States legal authorities, including with respect 
                to the use of sanctions.

        improving plans and strategies by the country for reducing 
        vulnerabilities and improving responses to such measures in the 
        future.
            (5) Assisting the partner country in dealing with foreign 
        sovereign investment in infrastructure or related projects that 
        may undermine the partner country's sovereignty.
            (6) Assisting the partner country in responding to specific 
        efforts from an adversary attempting to employ economic 
        coercion that undermines the partner country's sovereignty, 
        including efforts in the cyber domain, such as efforts that 
        undermine cybersecurity or digital security of the partner 
        country or initiatives that introduce digital technologies in a 
        manner that undermines freedom, security, and sovereignty of 
        the partner country.
            (7) Otherwise providing direct and relevant short-to-medium

SEC. 403. COUNTERING OVERSEAS KLEPTOCRACY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Authoritarian leaders in foreign countries abuse their 
        power to steal assets from state institutions, enrich 
        themselves at the expense of their countries' economic 
        development, and use corruption as a strategic tool both to 
        solidify their grip on power and to undermine democratic 
        institutions abroad.
            (2) Global corruption harms the competitiveness of United 
        States businesses, weakens democratic governance, feeds 
        terrorist recruitment and transnational organized crime, 
        enables drug smuggling and human trafficking, and stymies 
        economic growth.
            (3) Illicit financial flows often penetrate countries 
        through what appear to be legitimate financial transactions, as 
        kleptocrats launder money, use shell companies, amass offshore 
        wealth, and participate in a global shadow economy.
            (4) The Government of the Russian Federation is a leading 
        model of this type of kleptocratic system, using state-
        sanctioned corruption to both erode democratic governance from 
        within and discredit democracy abroad, thereby strengthening 
        the authoritarian rule of Vladimir Putin.
            (5) Corrupt individuals and entities in the Russian 
        Federation, often with the backing and encouragement of 
        political leadership, use stolen money--
                    (A) to purchase key assets in other countries, 
                often with a goal of attaining monopolistic control of 
                a sector;
                    (B) to gain access to and influence the policies of 
                other countries; and
                    (C) to advance Russian interests in other 
                countries, particularly those that undermine confidence 
                and trust in democratic systems.
            (6) Systemic corruption in the People's Republic of China 
        (PRC), often tied to, directed by, or backed by the leadership 
        of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Government of the 
        PRC is used--
                    (A) to provide unfair advantage to certain PRC 
                economic entities;
                    (B) to increase other countries' economic 
                dependence on the PRC to secure greater deference to 
                the PRC's diplomatic and strategic goals; and
                    (C) to exploit corruption in foreign governments 
                and among other political elites to enable PRC state-
                backed firms to pursue predatory and exploitative 
                economic practices.
            (7) Thwarting these tactics by Russian, Chinese, and other 
        kleptocratic actors requires the international community to 
        strengthen democratic governance and the rule of law. 
        International cooperation in combating corruption and illicit 
        finance is vital to such efforts, especially by empowering 
        reformers in foreign countries during historic political 
        openings for the establishment of the rule of law in those 
        countries.
            (8) Technical assistance programs that combat corruption 
        and strengthen the rule of law, including through assistance 
        provided by the Department of State's Bureau of International 
        Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and the United States 
        Agency for International Development, and through programs like 
        the Department of Justice's Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
        Development, Assistance and Training and the International 
        Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, can have 
        lasting and significant impacts for both foreign and United 
        States interests.
            (9) There currently exist numerous international 
        instruments to combat corruption, kleptocracy, and illicit 
        finance, including--
                    (A) the Inter-American Convention against 
                Corruption of the Organization of American States, done 
                at Caracas March 29, 1996;
                    (B) the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign 
                Public Officials in International Business Transactions 
                of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and

                referred to as the ``Anti-Bribery Convention'');
                    (C) the United Nations Convention against 
                Transnational Organized Crime, done at New York 
                November 15, 2000;
                    (D) the United Nations Convention against 
                Corruption, done at New York October 31, 2003;
                    (E) Recommendation of the Council for Further 
                Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in 
                International Business Transactions, adopted November 
                26, 2009; and
                    (F) recommendations of the Financial Action Task 
                Force comprising the International Standards on 
                Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of 
                Terrorism and Proliferation.

            (1) to pursue, in coordination with United States allies 
        and partners, arms control negotiations and sustained and 
        regular engagement with the People's Republic of China (PRC)--
                    (A) to enhance understanding of each other's 
                respective nuclear policies, doctrine, and 
                capabilities;
                    (B) to improve transparency; and
                    (C) to help manage the risks of miscalculation and 
                misperception;
            (2) to formulate a strategy to engage the Government of the 
        PRC on relevant issues that lays the groundwork for a 
        constructive arms control framework, including--
                    (A) fostering dialogue on arms control leading to 
                the convening of strategic security talks;
                    (B) negotiating norms for outer space;
                    (C) developing pre-launch notification regimes 
                aimed at reducing nuclear miscalculation; and
                    (D) expanding lines of communication between both 
                governments for the purposes of reducing the risks of 
                conventional war and increasing transparency;
            (3) to pursue relevant negotiations in coordination with 
        United States allies and partners to ensure the security of 
        United States and allied interests to slow the PRC's military 
        modernization and expansion, including on--
                    (A) ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles;
                    (B) integrated air and missile defense;
                    (C) hypersonic missiles;
                    (D) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance;

            (4) to ensure that the United States policy continues to 
        reassure United States allies and partners.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the interest of the United States and China to 
        cooperate in reducing risks of conventional and nuclear 
        escalation;
            (2) a physical, cyber, electronic, or any other People's 
        Liberation Army (PLA) attack on United States early warning 
        satellites, other portions of the nuclear command and control 
        enterprise, or critical infrastructure poses a high risk to 
        inadvertent but rapid escalation;
            (3) the United States and its allies and partners should 
        promote international norms on military operations in space, 
        the employment of cyber capabilities, and the military use of 
        artificial intelligence, as an element of risk reduction 
        regarding nuclear command and control; and
            (4) United States allies and partners should share the 
        burden of promoting and protecting norms regarding the 
        weaponization of space, highlighting unsafe behavior that 
        violates international norms, such as in rendezvous and 
        proximity operations, and promoting responsible behavior in 
        space and all other domains.

              TITLE VI--INVESTING IN A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE

SEC. 601. ENSURING NATIONAL SECURITY AND ECONOMIC PRIORITIES WITH THE 
              PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES ACCOUNT 
              FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND CLIMATE CHANGE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5C, published 
        by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on October 8, 
        2018, and the Fourth National Climate Assessment, first 
        published by the United States Global Change Research Program 
        in 2018, concluded that--
                    (A) the release of greenhouse gas emissions, most 
                notably the combustion of fossil fuels and the 
                degradation of natural resources that absorb 
                atmospheric carbon from human activity, are the 
                dominant causes of climate change during the past 
                century;
                    (B) changes in the Earth's climate are--
                            (i) causing sea levels to rise;
                            (ii) increasing the global average 
                        temperature of the Earth;
                            (iii) increasing the incidence and severity 
                        of wildfires; and
                            (iv) intensifying the severity of extreme 
                        weather, including hurricanes, cyclones, 
                        typhoons, flooding, droughts, and other 
                        disasters that threaten human life, healthy 
                        communities, and critical infrastructure.
            (2) An increase in the global average temperature of 2 
        degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrialized levels would 
        cause--
                    (A) the displacement, and the forced internal 
                migration, of an estimated 143,000,000 people in Latin 
                America, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 if 
                insufficient action is taken (according to the World 
                Bank);
                    (B) the displacement of an average of 17,800,000 
                people worldwide by floods every year (according to the 
                Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre) because of the 
                exacerbating effects of climate change;
                    (C) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual 
                economic output in the United States (a 10 percent 
                contraction from 2018 levels) by 2100 (according to the 
                Fourth National Climate Assessment);
                    (D) an additional 100,000,000 people worldwide to 
                be driven into poverty by 2030 (according to the World 
                Bank);
                    (E) greater food insecurity and decreased 
                agricultural production due to climate change's effects 
                on the increased frequency and intensity of extreme 
                weather events;
                    (F) the proliferation of agricultural pests and 
                crop diseases, loss of biodiversity, degrading 
                ecosystems, and water scarcity; and
                    (G) more than 350,000,000 additional people 
                worldwide to be exposed to deadly heat stress by 2050.
            (3) According to the International Energy Agency, the 
        United States, China, India, and the European Union (including 
        the United Kingdom) account for more than 58 percent of global 
        greenhouse gas emissions. China, which is the world's top 
        greenhouse gases emitter and has an outsized impact on the 
        United States' core interest in climate stability--
                    (A) is likely to achieve its carbon emissions 
                mitigation pledge to the Paris Agreement, contained in 
                its 2015 nationally determined contribution, to 
                ``peak'' emissions around 2030 ahead of schedule;
                    (B) announced, on September 22, 2020, and restated 
                on April 22, 2021, a pledge to achieve carbon 
                neutrality by 2060;
                    (C) announced on April 22, 2021, its intent to 
                strictly control coal fired power generation projects, 
                as well as strictly limit the increase in coal 
                consumption over the 14th five year plan period and 
                phase it down in the 15th five year plan period; and
                    (D) however, remains uncommitted to internationally 
                recognized metrics for achieving these goals.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) to address the climate crisis, the United States must 
        leverage the full weight of its diplomatic engagement and 
        foreign assistance to promote our national security and 
        economic interests related to climate change;
            (2) in the absence of United States leadership on global 
        issues driving international climate-related policymaking, it 
        would lead to a substantial and harmful decline in the Nation's 
        global competitiveness;
            (3) promoting international instruments on climate action 
        and other relevant international standards and best practices, 
        as such standards and practices develop, serve the interests of 
        the American people and protect United States environmental 
        resources and the planet;
            (4) promoting the adoption and implementation of 
        international climate-related agreements, standards, and 
        practices by foreign states ensures a level playing field for 
        United States businesses and other stakeholders;
            (5) working with international allies and partners to 
        promote environmental justice and climate justice serves the 
        American people's interests;
            (6) finding common ground with the People's Republic of 
        China (PRC) on climate action where possible is important, but 
        the United States must also continue to hold the PRC 
        accountable where its actions undermine the interests of the 
        United States and its allies and partners;
            (7) and in furtherance of the previous clauses, the United 
        States should--
                    (A) explore opportunities for constructive 
                cooperation on climate action initiatives with the PRC 
                and other countries while ensuring the United States 
                maintains its competitive advantage in climate-related 
                fields of expertise and industry, including--
                            (i) support for international cooperative 
                        policies, measures, and technologies to 
                        decarbonize industry and power, including 
                        through circular economy, energy storage and 
                        grid reliability, carbon capture, and green 
                        hydrogen; and
                            (ii) increased deployment of clean energy, 
                        including renewable and advanced nuclear power; 
                        green and climate resilient agriculture; energy 
                        efficient buildings; green, and low-carbon 
                        transportation;
                    (B) cooperate on addressing emissions of methane 
                and other non-CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; greenhouse gases;
                    (C) cooperate on addressing emissions from 
                international civil aviation and maritime activities;
                    (D) reduce emissions from coal, oil, and gas;
                    (E) implement the Paris Agreement that 
                significantly advances global climate ambition on 
                mitigation, adaptation, and support;
                    (F) coordinate among relevant federal, state, and 
                local departments and agencies on climate action 
                related initiatives;
                    (G) provide resources, authorities and support for 
                enhancing United States ambition and commitment to 
                solving the climate crisis including climate action 
                specific assistance and multilateral fund 
                contributions; and
                    (H) integrate considerations for climate change 
                into broader United States foreign policy decision-
                making and the United States national security 
                apparatus.

        agreements with other world powers on initiatives to advance 
        global clean energy innovation and other measures to mitigate 
        global greenhouse gas emissions and improve climate change 
        adaptation capacities;
            (5) to ensure that the United States national security 
        apparatus integrates critically important data on the 
        compounding effects that climate change is having on global 
        security risks by enhancing our understanding of how, where, 
        and when such effects are destabilizing countries and regions 
        in ways that may motivate conflict, displacement, and other 
        drivers of insecurity; and
            (6) to authorize funding and programs to support a 
        reaffirmation of the United States' commitments to

        Change in Paris, France, on December 12, 2015.
            (9) Resilience.--The term ``resilience'' means the ability 
        of human made and natural systems (including their component 
        parts) to anticipate, absorb, cope, accommodate, or recover 
        from the effects of a hazardous event in a timely and efficient 
        manner, including through ensuring the preservation, 
        restoration, or improvement of its essential basic structures

SEC. 603. BALANCING ACCOUNTABILITY AND COOPERATION WITH CHINA.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) successful mitigation of global greenhouse gas 
        emissions and changes to the environment require global 
        cooperation and coordination of efforts, as well as holding 
        other countries such as the People's Republic of China (PRC) 
        accountable for their actions and commitments to ensure a level 
        playing field with the United States and its allies and 
        partners;
            (2) other countries look toward the United States and the 
        PRC, as the world's largest emitters and largest economies, for 
        leadership by example to effectively mitigate greenhouse gas 
        emissions, develop and deploy energy generation technologies, 
        and integrate sustainable adaptation solutions to the 
        inevitable effects of climate change;
            (3) given the volume of the PRC's greenhouse gas emissions 
        and the scientific imperative to swiftly reduce global 
        greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero emissions around 2050, 
        China should--
                    (A) revise its long-term pledge;
                    (B) seek to immediately peak its emissions;
                    (C) begin reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 
                significantly to meet a more ambitious long-term 2050 
                reductions target; and
                    (D) update its nationally determined contribution 
                along a trajectory that aligns with achieving a more 
                ambitious net-zero by 2050 emissions target;
            (4) it is in the United States national interest to 
        emphasize the environment and climate change in its bilateral 
        engagement with the PRC, as global climate risks cannot be 
        mitigated without a significant reduction in PRC domestic and 
        overseas emissions;
            (5) the United States and the PRC, to the extent 
        practicable, should coordinate on making and delivering 
        ambitious pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with 
        aspirations towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions 
        by 2050;
            (6) the United States and its allies and partners should 
        work together, using diplomatic and economic tools, to hold the 
        PRC accountable for any failure by the PRC--
                    (A) to increase ambition in its 2030 nationally 
                determined contribution, in line with net zero 
                greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 before the 26th 
                Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC scheduled for 
                November 2021 and meeting a more ambitious nationally 
                determined contribution;
                    (B) to work faithfully to uphold the principles, 
                goals, and rules of the Paris Agreement;
                    (C) to avoid and prohibit efforts to undermine or 
                devolve the Paris Agreement's rule or underlying 
                framework, particularly within areas of accountability 
                transparency, and shared responsibility among all 
                parties;
                    (D) to eliminate greenhouse gas intensive projects 
                from the PRC's Belt and Road Initiative and other 
                overseas investments, including--
                            (i) working with United States allies and 
                        partners to eliminate support for coal power 
                        production projects in the Belt and Road 
                        Initiative;
                            (ii) providing financing and project 
                        support for cleaner and less risky 
                        alternatives; and
                            (iii) undertaking ``parallel initiatives'' 
                        to enhance capacity building programs and 
                        overseas sustainable investment criteria, 
                        including in areas such as integrated energy 
                        planning, power sector reform, just transition, 
                        distributed generation, procurement, 
                        transparency, and standards to support low-
                        emissions growth in developing countries; and
                    (E) to phase out existing coal power plants and 
                reduce net coal power production;
            (7) the United States should pursue confidence-building 
        opportunities for the United States and the PRC to undertake 
        ``parallel initiatives'' on clean energy research, development, 
        finance, and deployment, including through economic and 
        stimulus measures with clear, mutually agreed upon rules and 
        policies to protect intellectual property, ensure equitable, 
        nonpunitive provision of support, and verify implementation, 
        which would provide catalytic progress towards delivering a 
        global clean energy transformation that benefits all people;
            (8) the United States should pursue cooperative initiatives 
        to reduce global deforestation, including efforts to shift 
        toward the import and consummation of forest and agricultural 
        commodities that are produced in a manner that does not 
        contribute to deforestation; and
            (9) the United States should pursue appropriate scientific 
        cooperative exchanges and research that align with United 
        States interests and those of its international partners and 
        allies, provide reciprocity of access, protect intellectual 
        property rights, and preserve the values and human rights 
        interests of the American people.

                        carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC affect human 
                        health, safety, and our environment;
                            (ii) changes in the amount and regional 
                        concentrations of black carbon and methane 
                        emissions, based on scientific modeling and 
                        forecasting;
                            (iii) effective means to sequester black 
                        carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC; and
                            (iv) other related areas of research the 
                        United States representatives deem necessary;
                    (F) encouraging the World Bank, the International 
                Monetary Fund, and other international finance 
                organizations--
                            (i) to prioritize efforts to combat black 
                        carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC; and
                            (ii) to enhance transparency by providing 
                        sufficient and adequate information to 
                        facilitate independent verification of their 
                        climate finance reporting;
                    (G) encouraging observers of the Arctic Council 
                (including India and China) to adopt mitigation plans 
                consistent with the findings and recommendations of the 
                Arctic Council's Framework for Action on Black Carbon 
                and Methane;
                    (H) collaborating on technological advances in 
                black carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC pollutant 
                mitigation, sequestration and reduction technologies; 
                and

                national and subnational levels, regarding the 
                development and execution of regulatory policies, 
                services, and laws pertaining to reducing the creation 
                and the collection and safe management of black carbon, 
                methane, and high-GWP HFC.
    (c) Enhancing International Outreach and Partnership of United 
States Agencies Involved in Greenhouse Gas Reductions.--
            (1) Finding.--Congress recognizes the success of the United 
        States Climate Alliance and the greenhouse gas reduction 
        programs and strategies established by the Environmental 
        Protection Agency's Center for Corporate Climate Leadership.
            (2) Authorization of efforts to build foreign 
        partnerships.--The Secretary of State shall work with the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to build 
        partnerships, as appropriate, with the governments of foreign 
        countries and to support international efforts to reduce black 
        carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC.
    (d) Negotiation of New International Agreements and Reassertion of 
Targets in Existing Agreements.--Not later than 1 year after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a 
report to Congress that--
            (1) assesses the potential for negotiating new 
        international agreements, new targets within existing 
        international agreements or cooperative bodies, and the 
        creation of a new international forum to mitigate globally 
        black carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC to support the efforts 
        described in subsection (b);
            (2) describes the provisions that could be included in such 
        agreements;
            (3) assesses potential parties to such agreements;
            (4) describes a process for reengaging with Canada and 
        Mexico regarding the methane targets agreed to at the 2016 
        North American Leaders' Summit; and
            (5) describes a process for reengaging with the countries 
        of the Arctic Council regarding the methane and black carbon 
        targets that were negotiated in 2015 through the Framework for 
        Action.
    (e) Consideration of Black Carbon, Methane, and High-gwp Hfc in 
Negotiating International Agreements.--In negotiating any relevant 
international agreement with any country or countries after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the President shall--
            (1) consider the impact black carbon, methane, and high-GWP 
        HFC are having on the increase in global average temperatures 
        and the resulting global climate change;
            (2) consider the effects that climate change is having on 
        the environment; and
            (3) ensure that the agreement strengthens efforts to 
        eliminate black carbon, methane, and high-GWP HFC from such 
        country or countries.
    (f) Plan to Reduce Black Carbon Emissions From Ships.--Consistent 
with strategies adopted by the International Maritime Organization to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships, the Secretary of State, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Administrator, and the Commandant of the Coast Guard, 
shall develop a comprehensive plan to reduce black carbon emissions 
from ships based on appropriate emissions data from oceangoing vessels. 
The plan shall provide for such reduction through--
            (1) a clean freight partnership;
            (2) limits on black carbon emissions; and
            (3) efforts that include protection of access to critical 
        fuel shipments and emergency needs of coastal communities.

            (3) Duties.--The Working Group shall--
                    (A) not later than 180 days after the date of 
                enactment of this Act, submit to the appropriate 
                congressional committees a report that includes 
                specific plans of each relevant Federal agency--
                    (B) look for opportunities with other countries to 
                promote alternatives to high-GWP HFC, and transition 
                over time to equipment that uses safer and more 
                sustainable alternatives to high-GWP HFC;
                    (C) review the policy recommendations made by--

                the entities referred to in subparagraph (C).

SEC. 609. BUILDING UNITED STATES ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TECHNOLOGICAL 
              INNOVATION THROUGH THE GREEN CLIMATE FUND.

    (a) Green Climate Fund.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) climate change most severely impacts vulnerable 
                and disadvantaged communities in the United States and 
                around the world;
                    (B) it is the responsibility of the United States 
                Government to work with and press other countries to 
                address environmental justice and climate justice;
                    (C) the report of the United Nations Environment 
                Programme entitled ``Climate Change and the Cost of 
                Capital in Developing Countries'', dated May 2018, 
                found that, in the 10 years prior to the publication of 
                the report, climate vulnerability has cost the 20 
                nations most affected by catastrophes rooted in climate 
                change an additional $62,000,000,000 in interest 
                payments alone;
                    (D) individuals and families, particularly 
                communities of color, indigenous communities, and low-
                income communities, that are on the frontlines of 
                climate change across the globe are often in close 
                proximity to environmental stressors or sources of 
                pollution;
                    (E) the communities described in subparagraph (D)--
                            (i) are often the first exposed to the 
                        causes and impacts of climate change; and
                            (ii) have the fewest resources with which 
                        to mitigate those impacts or to relocate;
                    (F) all efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate 
                change must include specific protections for and 
                acknowledgment of the harm of climate change to 
                communities of color, indigenous peoples, women, and 
                other frontline communities and marginalized peoples 
                around the world;
                    (G) in Paris, on December 12, 2015, the parties to 
                the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
                Change adopted the Paris Agreement, a benchmark 
                agreement--
                            (i) to combat climate change;
                            (ii) to accelerate and intensify the 
                        actions and investments needed for a 
                        sustainable low carbon future; and
                            (iii) that acknowledges, ``Parties should, 
                        when taking action to address climate change, 
                        respect, promote and consider their respective 
                        obligations on human rights, the right to 
                        health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local 
                        communities, migrants, children, persons with 
                        disabilities and people in vulnerable 
                        situations and the right to development, as 
                        well as gender equality, empowerment of women 
                        and intergenerational equity'';
                    (H) the Paris Agreement--
                            (i) notes the importance of ``climate 
                        justice'' when mitigating and adapting to 
                        climate change; and
                            (ii) recognizes ``the need for an effective 
                        and progressive response to the urgent threat 
                        of climate change'';
                    (I) it is imperative for all countries to undertake 
                mitigation activities to rapidly meet the goal of 
                limiting global warming to not more than 1.5 degrees 
                Celsius;
                    (J) developed countries have the greatest capacity 
                to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions, while--
                            (i) developing countries have the least 
                        capacity to engage in mitigation activities; 
                        and
                            (ii) the capacity of developing countries 
                        to engage in mitigation activities is less than 
                        the national mitigation potential of those 
                        developing countries;
                    (K) the determination for the fair share of 
                mitigation and adaptation activities for each country 
                must take into account--
                            (i) the historic greenhouse gas emissions 
                        of each country; and
                            (ii) the current capacity of each country 
                        to both mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and 
                        adapt to climate impacts;
                    (L) developed countries that have historically 
                emitted a disproportionately high share of greenhouse 
                gas emissions, and reaped the economic benefits of 
                those polluting activities, have a corresponding 
                disproportionately greater responsibility to engage in 
                global mitigation and adaptation activities, as 
                compared to less industrialized countries that have 
                historically polluted far less;
                    (M) the only realistic way for less industrialized 
                countries to meet their full mitigation potential is 
                through international climate financing by more 
                developed countries;
                    (N) in the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, developed 
                countries committed to jointly mobilize, starting in 
                2020, $100,000,000,000 per year in public climate 
                financing (as well as private investment and other 
                alternative forms of finance), for developing 
                countries, a commitment reaffirmed in 2015 in Decision 
                1/CP.21 of the United Nations Framework Convention on 
                Climate Change, Adoption of the Paris Agreement;
                    (O) the $100,000,000,000 commitment described in 
                subparagraph (N) was a political compromise that falls 
                short of the actual financing needs for climate action 
                in developing countries;
                    (P) Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated that 
                the transition to renewable energy sources in 
                developing countries will require hundreds of billions 
                of dollars annually;
                    (Q) the United Nations Environment Programme has 
                estimated that adaptation needs relating to climate 
                change in developing countries may be as much as 
                $300,000,000,000 annually by 2030;
                    (R) the Green Climate Fund was created in 2010 by 
                194 countries to serve as a crucial financing mechanism 
                to help developing countries limit or reduce greenhouse 
                gas emissions and adapt to climate change;
                    (S) in 2015, the United Nations Framework 
                Convention on Climate Change agreed that the Green 
                Climate Fund should serve the goals of the Paris 
                Agreement, which states that ``developed country 
                Parties shall provide financial resources to assist 
                developing country Parties with respect to both 
                mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their 
                existing obligations under the Convention'';
                    (T) the Green Climate Fund is an essential 
                institution for climate financing, as the Green Climate 
                Fund ensures--
                            (i) balanced governance between developed 
                        and developing countries;
                            (ii) stakeholder engagement and discourse;
                            (iii) a balanced approach between 
                        mitigation and adaptation;
                            (iv) fair and equal labor and working 
                        conditions;
                            (v) conservation of biodiversity and 
                        critical habitats; and
                            (vi) strong environmental, social, and 
                        gender protections;
                    (U) the Green Climate Fund--
                            (i) promotes and protects human rights and 
                        the rights of marginalized groups, including 
                        indigenous peoples, women, children, and people 
                        with disabilities; and
                            (ii) continues to take steps to strengthen 
                        protection for marginalized groups;
                            (iii) the United States committed 
                        $3,000,000,000 of the first $10,000,000,000 
                        raised for the initial resource mobilization 
                        period of the Green Climate Fund, though only 
                        \1/3\ of this pledge was fulfilled, leaving the 
                        United States the only country to fall 
                        substantially short of a commitment of a 
                        country to the Green Climate Fund; and
                    (V) the Green Climate Fund is a fully operational 
                and proven institution supporting well over 100 
                projects and programs in developing countries around 
                the world.
            (2) Statement of policy.--It is the policy of the United 
        States to provide climate financing--
                    (A) as an essential part of the global effort to 
                combat climate change; and
                    (B) that--
                            (i) upholds the principles of environmental 
                        justice and climate justice;
                            (ii) supports programs and projects 
                        developed by recipient countries and 
                        communities;
                            (iii) is designed and implemented with the 
                        free, prior, and informed consent of indigenous 
                        peoples and other impacted communities;
                            (iv) promotes gender equality as essential 
                        in all of the projects and programs supported 
                        by climate financing;
                            (v) includes best practices for 
                        environmental and social safeguards to ensure 
                        that projects and programs supported by climate 
                        financing respect fundamental human rights; and
                            (vi) addresses both mitigation and 
                        adaptation as essential aspects of responding 
                        to climate change.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for contributions to the Green Climate Fund $4,000,000,000 
for each of the fiscal years 2022 and 2023.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
climate financing needs to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions 
reductions required to keep the planet at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius 
of global warming are significantly greater than the amount of funds 
authorized to be appropriated under subsection (a).

SEC. 611. WORKING WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS TO REDUCE DEFORESTATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) is having a 
        substantial impact on the most important forest ecosystems in 
        the world, and illegal logging and agricultural expansion have 
        caused the massive forest loss. According to the World 
        Resources Institute, the PRC has become the world's leading 
        importer and consumer of timber products, soybeans, and palm 
        oil, as well as the largest manufacturing and export country of 
        forest products.
            (2) In 2016, the PRC imported logs from more than 100 
        countries in the world. According to a Global Witness report, 
        between January 2013 and April 2020, Chinese financial 
        institutions provided more than $22.5 billion to major 
        companies that produce and trade commodities at high risk of 
        driving deforestation. These commodities include beef, soy, 
        palm oil, paper, pulp, rubber, and timber.
            (3) Further, the growing international demand for such 
        agricultural commodities causes the majority of deforestation 
        emissions globally, and most of the associated land-clearing 
        violates applicable national or local laws. According to a 2021 
        Forest Trends report, at least 69 percent of forest land 
        converted to pasture or cropland was cleared illegally.
            (4) The growing demand for timber and agricultural 
        commodities has accelerated unsustainable--and often illegal--
        logging and the trade of timber products, which harms the 
        countries in which it takes place by siphoning away government 
        tax revenue, transforming the livelihoods of communities 
        dependent on forests, and hurting legal businesses' 
        competitiveness. Further, illegal logging and illegal 
        conversion of forest to agricultural land threatens 
        biodiversity and accelerates deforestation and forest 
        degradation in key timber supply countries, undermining United 
        States and global climate goals.
            (5) The United States should work with international 
        partners to ensure that Chinese and other banks factor into 
        lending practices the environmental and social impact of the 
        companies they finance. This should include pressuring the PRC 
        and other countries to revise regulations to require the 
        banking sector not to finance companies linked to deforestation 
        and include rigorous checks on the companies operating in 
        sectors or regions where there is a high risk of deforestation 
        to ensure they are not associated with deforestation.

            (5) Forest.--
                    (A) In general.--The term ``forest'' means a 
                terrestrial ecosystem, including wetland forests, 
                comprised of native tree species generated and 
                maintained primarily through natural ecological and 
                evolutionary processes.
                    (B) Exclusion.--The term ``forest'' does not 
                include plantations, such as crops of trees planted by 
                humans primarily for the purposes of harvesting.
            (6) Forest degradation.--The term ``forest degradation'' is 
        any reduction in the carbon stock of a forest due to the 
        effects of human land-use activities, including such land-use 
        activities on peatlands.
            (7) Intact forest.--The term ``intact forest'' means an 
        unbroken expanse of natural ecosystems within the global extent

                minimally influenced by human economic activity and 
                large enough that all native biodiversity, including 
                viable populations of wide-ranging species, could be 
                maintained.
            (9) Leakage.--The term ``leakage'' means the unexpected 
        loss of anticipated carbon benefits due to the displacement of 
        activities in a project area to areas outside the project, 
        resulting in carbon emissions.
            (10) Leakage prevention activities.--The term ``leakage 
        prevention activities'' means activities in developing 
        countries that are directed at preserving existing forest 
        carbon stocks, including forested wetlands and peatlands that 
        might, absent such activities, be lost through leakage.
            (11) National deforestation reduction activities.--The term 
        ``national deforestation reduction activities'' means 
        activities in developing countries that reduce a quantity of 
        greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation that is calculated 
        by measuring actual emissions against a national deforestation 
        baseline established pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of 
        subsection (d)(4).
            (12) Subnational deforestation and forest degradation 
        reduction activities.--The term ``subnational deforestation and 
        forest degradation reduction activities'' means activities in 
        developing countries that reduce a quantity of greenhouse gas 
        emissions from deforestation and forest degradation that is 
        calculated by measuring actual emissions using an appropriate 
        baseline, or an alternative determined under subsection 
        (d)(4)(B)(ii), established by the Administrator at the State or 
        provincial level.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to provide United 
States assistance to developing countries to develop, implement, and 
improve actions that reduce deforestation and forest degradation or 
conserve or restore forest ecosystems--
            (1) to protect the value of forest ecosystems with respect 
        to permanent carbon capture and sequestration in a manner in 
        which such value is measurable, reportable, and verifiable; and
            (2) in a manner that--
                    (A) is consistent with and enhances the 
                implementation of complementary United States policies 
                that support the good governance of forests, 
                biodiversity conservation, and environmentally 
                sustainable development;
                    (B) takes into consideration the views and 
                participation of local communities and most vulnerable 
                communities and populations, particularly forest-
                dependent communities; and
                    (C) incorporates the right to free prior and 
                informed consent of indigenous peoples.
    (d) Emissions Reductions Through Reduced Deforestation.--
            (1) Establishment of program.--Not later than 1 year after 
        the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in 
        consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall establish a 
        program to provide assistance to reduce deforestation in 
        developing countries and its impacts, in accordance with this 
        section.

                        subsequent years;
                    (B) to build capacity to reduce deforestation at a 
                national level in developing countries experiencing 
                deforestation, which may include--
                            (i) preparing developing countries to 
                        participate in international markets for 
                        international offset credits for reduced 
                        emissions from deforestation;
                            (ii) supporting the development of overseas

                    (C) as appropriate, considering multi-year funding 
                arrangements in carrying out the purposes of this 
                section.
            (4) Standards.--The Administrator, in consultation with 
        other appropriate agencies, shall establish program standards 
        that--
                    (A) ensure that emissions reductions achieved 
                through supported activities--
                            (i) are additional, measurable, verifiable, 
                        and monitored;
                            (ii) account for leakage, uncertainty, and 
                        permanence; and
                            (iii) at a minimum, meet the standards 
                        established under the emissions unit criteria 
                        of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme 
                        for International Aviation (CORSIA) developed 
                        by the International Civil Aviation 
                        Organization (ICAO);
                    (B) require--
                            (i) the establishment of a national 
                        deforestation baseline for each country with 
                        national deforestation reduction activities 
                        that is used to account for reductions achieved 
                        from such activities; or
                            (ii) if a developing country has 
                        established policies and taken measures to 
                        reduce emissions from disturbed peatlands, 
                        deforestation, or forest degradation, but has 
                        not established a national baseline, the 
                        provision of a credible, transparent, accurate, 
                        and conservative alternative for quantifying 
                        emissions;
                    (C) provide that each national deforestation 
                baseline established under subparagraph (B)(i)--
                            (i) is national, or subnational on an 
                        interim basis, in scope; and
                            (ii) is consistent with nationally 
                        appropriate mitigation commitments or actions 
                        with respect to deforestation, taking into 
                        consideration--
                                    (I) the average annual historical 
                                deforestation rates of the country 
                                during a period of at least 5 years; 
                                and

                                deforestation and other factors to 
                                ensure additionality;
                            (iii) establishes a trajectory that would 
                        result in zero net deforestation by not later 
                        than 20 years after the date on which the 
                        baseline is established;
                            (iv) is adjusted over time to account for 
                        changing national circumstances; and
                            (v) is designed to account for all 
                        significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions 
                        from deforestation in the country;
                    (D) with respect to assistance provided for 
                activities described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of 
                paragraph (2), require emissions reductions to be 
                achieved and verified before the provision of any 
                assistance under this section;
                    (E) with respect to accounting for subnational 
                deforestation and forest degradation reduction 
                activities that lack the standardized or precise 
                measurement and monitoring techniques needed for a full 
                accounting of changes in emissions or baselines, or are 
                subject to other sources of uncertainty, apply a 
                conservative discount factor to reflect the uncertainty 
                regarding the levels of reductions achieved;
                    (F) ensure that activities under this section are 
                designed, carried out, and managed--
                            (i) using forest management practices that, 
                        in an open and transparent process--
                                    (I) improve the livelihoods of 
                                forest communities in a manner that 
                                promotes the maintenance of intact 
                                forests, protects associated 
                                biodiversity, and restores native 
                                forest species and ecosystems while 
                                avoiding the introduction of invasive 
                                nonnative species;
                                    (II) maintain natural biodiversity, 
                                resilience, and carbon storage capacity 
                                of forests;
                                    (III) to the extent practicable, do 
                                not adversely affect the permanence of 
                                forest carbon stocks or emissions 
                                reductions;
                                    (IV) include broad stakeholder 
                                participation and the free prior and

                                peoples; and
                                    (V) take into account the needs and 
                                interests of local communities, forest-

                        benefits derived from the activities with local 
                        communities, indigenous peoples, and forest-
                        dependent communities; and

                        communities, indigenous peoples, and forest-
                        dependent communities.
            (5) Scope.--
                    (A) Reduced emissions.--The Administrator shall 
                include reduced emissions from forest degradation and 
                disturbance of peatlands within the scope of activities 
                under this section.
                    (B) Expansion of authorized activities.--If the 
                Administrator determines, in consultation with other 
                appropriate agencies, that sufficient methodologies and 
                technical capacities exist to measure, monitor, and 
                account for the emissions referred to in subparagraph 
                (A), the Administrator may expand the authorized 
                activities under this section, as appropriate, to 
                include reduced soil carbon-derived emissions 
                associated with deforestation and degradation of 
                forested wetlands and peatlands, consistent with a 
                comprehensive approach to maintaining and enhancing 
                forests, increasing climate resiliency, reducing 
                emissions, and increasing removals of greenhouse gases.
            (6) Accounting.--The Administrator shall use a publicly 
        accessible registry to account for and register the emissions 
        reductions achieved through assistance provided under this 
        section each year, after appropriately discounting for 
        uncertainty and other relevant factors as required by the 
        standards established under paragraph (4).
            (7) International deforestation reduction program insurance 
        account for noncompletion or reversal.--In furtherance of the 
        objectives described in subsection (c)(2), the Administrator 
        shall develop and implement a program that--
                    (A) addresses noncompletion or reversal with 
                respect to any greenhouse gas emissions that were not, 
                or are no longer, sequestered; and
                    (B) may include a mechanism to hold in reserve a 
                portion of the amount allocated for projects to support 
                the program.
            (8) Extension of assistance.--
                    (A) In general.--The Administrator may extend, for 
                an additional 5 years, the period during which 
                assistance is authorized for activities supported by 
                assistance under this section, if the Administrator 
                determines that--
                            (i) the country in which the activities are 
                        conducted is making substantial progress toward 
                        adopting and implementing a program to achieve 
                        reductions in deforestation measured against a 
                        national baseline;
                            (ii) the greenhouse gas emissions 
                        reductions achieved as a result of the 
                        activities are not resulting in significant 
                        leakage;
                            (iii) such greenhouse gas emissions 
                        reductions are being appropriately discounted 
                        to account for any leakage that is occurring; 
                        and
                            (iv) such extension would further advance 
                        or ensure achievement of the objectives of the 
                        activities.
                    (B) Assistance for subnational deforestation and 
                forest degradation reduction activities.--
                            (i) In general.--If the Administrator 
                        extends the period during which assistance is 
                        authorized for activities under subparagraph 
                        (A), the Administrator shall determine, based 
                        on the criteria specified that subparagraph, 
                        whether such assistance should include 
                        assistance for subnational deforestation and 
                        forest degradation reduction activities.
                            (ii) Continued assistance.--The 
                        Administrator may extend the period during 
                        which assistance is authorized for subnational 
                        deforestation and forest degradation reduction 
                        activities beyond the 5-year period described 
                        in subparagraph (A) in order to further the 
                        objectives described in subparagraph (B) or (C) 
                        of subsection (c)(2).

        in subsection (c)(2), seek to align activities under this 
        section with broader development, poverty alleviation, or 
        natural resource management objectives and initiatives in 
        countries receiving assistance under this section.
            (10) Assistance as supplement.--The provision of assistance 
        for activities under this section shall be used to supplement, 
        and not to supplant, any other Federal, State, or local support 
        available to carry out activities under this section.
            (11) Funding limitation.--Of the funds made available to 
        carry out this section in any fiscal year, not more than 7 
        percent may be used for the administrative expenses of the 
        United States Agency for International Development in support 
        of activities described in paragraph (2). Such amount shall be 
        in addition to other amounts otherwise available for such 
        purposes.
    (f) Legal Effect.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
        to supersede, limit, or otherwise affect any restriction 
        imposed by Federal law (including regulations) on any 
        interaction between an entity located in the United States and 
        an entity located in a foreign country.
            (2) Role of the secretary of state.--Nothing in this

SEC. 612. CONTROLLING THE EXPORT OF ELECTRONIC WASTE TO PROTECT UNITED 
              STATES SUPPLY CHAINS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is in the national security interests of the United 
        States to ensure that the export of electronic waste does not 
        become the source of counterfeit goods that may reenter 
        electronics supply chains in the United States, and for other 
        purposes.
            (2) A 2012 Senate Armed Services Committee Report 
        ``discovered counterfeit electronic parts from China in the Air 
        Force's largest cargo plane, in assemblies intended for Special 
        Operations helicopters, and in a Navy surveillance plane among 
        1,800 cases of bogus parts''.
            (3) Further, exporting such material has often resulted in 
        environmental damage because of illegal dumping or inadequate 
        environmental regulations in other countries for ensuring their 
        safe and secure disposal.
            (4) China, the single largest producer of electronic waste, 
        is on track for its e-waste industry to total $23,800,000,000 
        by 2030, given its high supply of used products, demand for 
        recycled materials, and capacity to transport these materials.
            (5) As the second largest producer of electronic waste, the 
        United States has a strong economic and national security 
        incentive to enhance domestic e-waste recycling capacity rather 
        than exporting to China and other countries.
            (6) Given China's lack of regulations and worker 
        protections, workers in the e-waste industry have been exposed 
        to over 1,000 harmful substances, including lead and mercury, 
        endangering the health and wellbeing of workers.

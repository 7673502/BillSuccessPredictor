SEC. 2. PUBLICATION OF DOCUMENTS IN ADVANCE OF FTC VOTING.

    (a) Amendment.--Section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 
U.S.C. 57a) is amended by inserting at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(k)(1) The Commission may not adopt any order, decision, report, 
or action by vote of the Commission at a meeting of the Commission, 
unless the Chairman causes to be published on the website of the 
Commission the text of such order, decision, report, or action not 
later than 30 days before the date on which the vote is to occur, 
except when the Chairman determines that emergency or other exigent 
circumstances require publication less than 30 days before the date on 
which the vote is to occur.
    ``(2) The text published pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be the 
text intended at the time of the publishing to be subject to a vote. 
Nothing in this subsection may be construed to prevent the Commission 
from making changes to the text after the publishing.
    ``(3) If the Chairman determines that publication of all or a 
portion of an order, decision, report, or action is likely to lead to a 
result described in a paragraph of section 552b(c) of title 5, United 
States Code, the Chairman may exempt such order, decision, report, or 
action, or such portion, as the case may be, from the publication 
requirements of this subsection.
    ``(4) This subsection does not--
            ``(A) create any rights or remedies; or
            ``(B) provide a basis for challenging any order, decision, 
        report, or action adopted by the Commission.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
beginning on the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.

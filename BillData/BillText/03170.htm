   To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide relief for

              COMMIT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FRAUD.

    In collaboration with the Department of Labor, and applicable to 
tax years beginning in 2020 or 2021, the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue shall--
            (1) implement a process to hold harmless taxpayers who are 
        flagged for unreported income if those taxpayers believe they 
        are victims of identity theft, or that fraudulent unemployment 
        benefits were claimed in their name, such that no penalties or 
        interest shall accrue against them; and
            (2) require States to report the amount of fraudulent 
        unemployment benefits that are excluded as income from Form 
        1099-G's issued by the State due to suspected or confirmed 
        fraud.

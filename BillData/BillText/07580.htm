            (3) Conversion.--Upon showing to the satisfaction of the 
        Secretary of a valuable mineral deposit on lands subject to 
        such a claim, the Secretary may convert the claim to a 
        noncompetitive lease under the regulations issued under 
        subsection (d).
            (4) Claims not converted.--Any such claims not converted to 
        leases at the end of the applicable period under paragraph (1) 
        or (2) shall be considered invalid and void.
    (c) Existing Claims With Plan of Operation.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of any claim under the general 
        mining laws for which a plan of operations has been approved 
        but for which operations have not commenced before the date of 
        enactment of this Act--
                    (A) during the 10-year period beginning on the date 
                of enactment of this Act--
                            (i) mineral activities on lands subject to 
                        such claim shall be subject to such plan of 
                        operations; and
                            (ii) modification of such plan may be made 
                        in accordance with the provisions of law 
                        applicable before the date of enactment of this 
                        Act if such modifications are considered minor 
                        by the Secretary concerned; and
                    (B) the operator shall bring such mineral 
                activities into compliance with this Act by the end of 
                such 10-year period.
            (2) Activities pending decision on modification to plan of 
        operations.--If an application for modification of a plan of 
        operations referred to in paragraph (1)(A)(ii) has been timely 
        submitted and an approved plan expires before the Secretary 
        concerned takes action on the application, mineral activities 
        and reclamation may continue in accordance with the terms of 
        the expired plan until such Secretary makes an administrative 
        decision on the application.
            (3) Conversion requirement.--Any claims referred to in 
        paragraph (1) may remain in effect for a period of up to 10 
        years. Any claim not converted to a lease under subsection (d) 
        before the end of that period shall be subject to a fee of $100 
        per acre per day until the claim is converted to a lease.
    (d) Conversion Regulations.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall issue regulations not 
        later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act to 
        provide for the conversion of mining claims to noncompetitive 
        mining leases.
            (2) Content.--The regulations issued under paragraph (1) 
        shall--
                    (A) prohibit the conversion of a mining claim to a 
                mining lease by a claimholder who is in violation of 
                this Act or other State or Federal environmental, 
                health, or worker safety law;
                    (B) allow the Secretary to exercise discretion to 
                include nonmineral lands within the boundaries of any 
                mill site associated with the mining claim to be 
                converted to a noncompetitive lease;
                    (C) prohibit the area in any noncompetitive mining 
                lease issued under this subsection to exceed the 
                maximum area authorized by this Act to be leased to any 
                person;
                    (D) require the consent of the surface managing 
                agency for conversion of a mining claim to a

    (e) National Environmental Policy Act.--The Secretary is not 
required to conduct an environmental analysis under the National 
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) for the 
issuance of a noncompetitive lease under this section, unless the 
noncompetitive lease modifies or extends the surface disturbance 
already authorized under a mine plan of operations covering the mining 
claim that is converted.

SEC. 102. LIMITATION ON PATENTS.

    (a) Mining Claims.--
            (1) Determinations required.--After the date of enactment 
        of this Act, no patent shall be issued by the United States for 
        any mining claim located under the general mining laws unless 
        the Secretary determines that, for the claim concerned--
                    (A) a patent application was filed with the 
                Secretary on or before September 30, 1994; and
                    (B) all requirements established under sections 
                2325 and 2326 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C. 29 and 
                30), in the case of a vein or lode claim, or sections 
                2329, 2330, 2331, and 2333 of the Revised Statutes (30 
                U.S.C. 35, 36, and 37), in the case of a placer claim, 
                were fully complied with by that date.
            (2) Right to patent.--If the Secretary makes the 
        determinations referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of 
        paragraph (1) for any mining claim, the holder of the claim 
        shall be entitled to the issuance of a patent in the same 
        manner and degree to which such claim holder would have been 
        entitled to prior to the enactment of this Act, unless such 
        determinations are withdrawn or invalidated by the Secretary or 
        by a court of the United States.
    (b) Millsite Claims.--
            (1) Determinations required.--After the date of enactment 
        of this Act, no patent shall be issued by the United States for 
        any millsite claim located under the general mining laws unless

        paragraph (1) for any millsite claim, the holder of the claim 
        shall be entitled to the issuance of a patent in the same 
        manner and degree to which such claim holder would have been 
        entitled to prior to the enactment of this Act, unless such 
        determinations are withdrawn or invalidated by the Secretary or 
        by a court of the United States.

SEC. 103. PROSPECTING LICENSE AND HARDROCK LEASES.

    (a) In General.--No person may conduct mineral prospecting for 
commercial purposes for any hardrock mineral on Federal lands without a 
prospecting license or a small miners lease.
    (b) Prospecting Licenses.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary may, under such rules and 
        regulations as the Secretary may prescribe and with the 
        concurrence of the relevant surface management agency, grant an 
        applicant a prospecting license that shall give the exclusive 
        right to prospect for specified hardrock minerals on Federal 
        lands for a period of not exceeding 2 years.
            (2) Maximum area.--The area subject to such a license shall 
        not exceed 2,560 acres of land, in reasonably compact form.
            (3) License application fee.--The Secretary shall charge a 
        fee for each license application to cover the costs of 
        processing the license, and the license shall be subject to 
        annual rentals equal to $10 per acre per year.
            (4) Terms and conditions.--A prospecting license must 
        conform with the terms and conditions of a comprehensive land 
        use plan approved under the Federal Land Policy and Management 
        Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) or the Forest and 
        Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 
        1600 et seq.). For areas where a comprehensive land use plan 
        treating hardrock mining as a multiple-use activity has not 
        been completed, the Secretary concerned shall ensure that the 
        land to be covered by the license is suitable for mineral 
        activities.
            (5) Extension.--A prospecting license may be extended for 
        up to an additional 4 years upon a showing by the licensee that 
        the licensee explored with reasonable diligence and was unable 
        to determine the existence and workability of a valuable 
        deposit covered by the license, or that the failure to perform 
        diligent prospecting activities was due to conditions beyond 
        the licensee's control.
    (c) Noncompetitive Leases.--
            (1) In general.--Upon a showing to the satisfaction of the 
        Secretary by a prospecting licensee under subsection (a) that a 
        valuable deposit of a hardrock mineral has been discovered by 
        the licensee within an area covered by the prospecting license 
        and with the consent of the surface agency, the licensee shall 
        be entitled to a lease for any or all of the land included in 
        the prospecting license, as well as any nonmineral lands 
        necessary for processing or milling operations, at a royalty of 
        no less than 12.5 percent of the gross value of production of 
        hardrock minerals or mineral concentrates or products derived 
        from hardrock minerals under the lease. Rentals for such lease 
        shall be set by the Secretary at no less than $10 per acre per 
        year, with rentals paid in any one year credited against 
        royalties accruing for that year. The recipient of such lease 
        is not entitled to an operations permit.
            (2) Lease period.--
                    (A) In general.--A lease under this section shall 
                be for a period of 20 years, with the right to renew 
                for successive periods of 10 years if hardrock minerals 
                are being produced in commercial quantities under the 
                lease.
                    (B) Extension during nonproduction.--If hardrock 
                minerals are not being produced in commercial 
                quantities at the end of the primary term or any 
                subsequent term of such a lease, the Secretary may 
                issue a 10-year extension of the lease in the interest 
                of conservation, reclamation maintenance, or upon a 
                successful showing by the lessee that the lease cannot 
                be successfully operated at a profit or for other 
                reasons. No more than one extension under this 
                subparagraph may be issued.
    (d) Cumulative Acreage Limitation.--No person may take, hold, own, 
or control at one time, whether acquired directly from the Secretary 
under this Act or otherwise, hardrock mining leases or licenses for an 
aggregate of more than 20,480 acres in any one State.
    (e) Reduction of Royalty Rate.--
            (1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary--
                    (A) may reduce the royalty rate for a lease upon a 
                showing by clear and convincing evidence by the person 
                conducting mineral activities under the lease that 
                production would not occur without the reduction in 
                royalty; and
                    (B) may reduce royalty and rental rates for a lease 
                to encourage exploration for and development of 
                hardrock minerals classified as strategic and critical 
                by the Department of Energy.
            (2) The Secretary may not reduce the royalty rate for a 
        lease pursuant to paragraph (1) to a royalty rate of less than 
        6.25 percent.
    (f) Protection of Land and Other Resources.--The Secretary may 
include in any lease or license issued under this Act such provisions 
as are necessary to adequately protect the lands and other resources in 
the vicinity of the area subject to the lease or license. For land not 
managed by the Department of the Interior, the Secretary shall consult 
with the appropriate surface management agency in formulating such 
provisions.

SEC. 104. COMPETITIVE LEASING.

    (a) In General.--Subject to sections 111 and 112, Federal lands 
known to contain valuable deposits of hardrock minerals that are not 
covered by claims, licenses, or leases may only be open to hardrock 
mineral exploration or development through competitive leasing by the 
Secretary by such methods the Secretary may adopt by regulation and in 
such areas as the Secretary may determine, including nonmineral lands 
the Secretary considers necessary for processing or milling operations. 
The total area of land subject to any such lease shall not exceed 2,560 
acres.
    (b) Terms and Requirements.--All terms and requirements for 
competitive leases under this section shall be the same as if the 
leases were issued noncompetitively under section 103(c).

SEC. 105. SMALL MINERS LEASES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary may issue small miners leases to 
qualified small miners that apply, under such rules and regulations as 
the Secretary may prescribe, including conditions to require diligent 
development of the lease and to ensure protection of surface resources 
and groundwater.
    (b) Exclusive Right.--A small miners lease shall give the lease 
holder the exclusive right to prospect for hardrock minerals for 3 
years on up to 200 acres of contiguous or non-contiguous Federal land.
    (c) Application Fee.--The Secretary shall charge a reasonable 
application fee for such a lease.
    (d) Rentals.--Rentals for such a lease shall be $5 per acre per 
year for the first 3 years.
    (e) Renewal.--Such leases may be renewed for additional 3-year 
periods, with no limit, with a $10 per acre per year rental charged for 
renewed leases.
    (f) Challenge.--Any individual may file a challenge with the 
Secretary that a lease holder is in violation of the diligence terms of 
a small miners lease or does not qualify as a small miner. A small 
miners lease that is under such a challenge may not be renewed unless 
the Secretary has determined that the lease holder is a small miner and 
is in compliance with all the terms of the lease.
    (g) No Royalties.--No royalties shall be charged for commercial 
production under a small miners lease.
    (h) Conversion of Existing Claims.--An existing claim, as of the 
date of enactment of this Act, that belongs to an individual that 
qualifies as a small miner may be converted to a small miners lease 
under the same terms and conditions that apply to other small miners 
leases, except that such lease--
            (1) shall not be subject to rental during the primary term 
        of the lease;
            (2) shall be subject to a rental of $5 per acre per year 
        for the first 3-year renewal of the lease; and
            (3) shall be subject to a rental of $10 per acre per year 
        for any subsequent 3-year renewal of the lease.
    (i) Limitations.--A small miners lease--
            (1) may only be held by the primary lease holder, a spouse 
        thereof, or a direct descendent thereof;
            (2) may not be sold or transferred, other than to a spouse 
        or direct descendent of the primary lease holder; and
            (3) is subject to all permitting requirements under this 
        Act.
    (j) Conversion to Hardrock Mineral Lease.--If, with regards to a 
lease, the lease holder no longer qualifies as a small miner at the 
time such lease holder applies for a renewal of such lease, such lease 
holder shall not be eligible to renew the small miners lease, but shall 
be eligible for a noncompetitive hardrock mineral lease issued under 
section 103(c). Notwithstanding section 103(c)(1), royalties under such 
a lease shall only be due on the gross income that exceeds the amount 
of gross income specified in such definition as of the time the 
hardrock mineral lease is issued.

SEC. 106. LANDS CONTAINING NONHARDROCK MINERALS; OTHER USES.

    (a) In General.--In issuing licenses and leases under this Act for 
lands that contain deposits of coal or other nonhardrock minerals, the 
Secretary shall reserve to the United States such nonhardrock minerals 
for disposal under applicable laws.
    (b) Other Uses of Licensed and Leased Lands.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall promulgate regulations 
        to allow for other uses of the lands covered by a prospecting 
        license under this Act, including leases for other minerals, if 
        such other uses would not unreasonably interfere with 
        operations under the prospecting license.
            (2) Prospecting licenses.--The Secretary shall include in 
        such prospecting licenses such terms and conditions as the 
        Secretary finds necessary to avoid unreasonable interference 
        with other uses occurring on, or other leases of, the licensed 
        lands.
            (3) Leases.--The Secretary shall include in leases under 
        this Act stipulations to allow for simultaneous operations 
        under other leases for the same lands.

SEC. 107. ROYALTY.

    (a) Existing Production.--Production of hardrock minerals on 
Federal land under an operations permit from which valuable hardrock 
minerals were produced in commercial quantities before the date of 
enactment of this Act, other than production under a small miners 
lease, shall be subject to a royalty established by the Secretary at no 
less than 8 percent of the gross value of such production, or of 
mineral concentrates or products derived from hardrock minerals. Any 
Federal land added through a plan modification to an operations permit 
on Federal land that is submitted after the date of enactment of this 
Act shall be subject to a royalty established by the Secretary for such 
lease of no less than 12.5 percent of the gross value of production of 
hardrock minerals, or mineral concentrates or products derived from 
hardrock minerals.
    (b) Liability.--The claim or lease holder, or any operator to whom

        operations subject to such interest charges, fines, or 
        penalties are or were located; and
            (2) the remainder shall be deposited in the account 
        established under section 401.
    (d) Duties of Claim or Lease Holders, Operators, and 
Transporters.--
            (1) Regulation.--The Secretary shall prescribe by rule the

            (4) Joint and several liability.--Any person liable for 
        royalty payments under this section who assigns any payment 
        obligation shall remain jointly and severally liable for all 
        royalty payments due for the period.
            (5) Obligations.--A person conducting mineral activities 
        shall--
                    (A) develop and comply with the site security 
                provisions in the operations permit designed to protect 
                from theft the hardrock minerals, concentrates, or 
                products derived therefrom that are produced or stored 
                on the area subject to a mining claim or lease, and 
                such provisions shall conform with such minimum 
                standards as the Secretary may prescribe by rule, 
                taking into account the variety of circumstances on 
                areas subject to mining claims and leases; and
                    (B) not later than the fifth business day after 
                production begins anywhere on an area subject to a 
                mining claim or lease, or production resumes after more 
                than 90 days after production was suspended, notify the 
                Secretary, in the manner prescribed by the Secretary,

            (6) Required documentation.--The Secretary may by rule 
        require any person engaged in transporting a hardrock mineral, 
        concentrate, or product derived therefrom to carry on his or 
        her person, in his or her vehicle, or in his or her immediate 
        control, documentation showing, at a minimum, the amount, 
        origin, and intended destination of the hardrock mineral, 
        concentrate, or product derived therefrom in such circumstances 
        as the Secretary determines is appropriate.
    (e) Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--A claim or lease holder, operator, or 
        other person directly involved in developing, producing,

        minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom, subject 
        to this Act, through the point of royalty computation shall 
        establish and maintain any records, make any reports, and 
        provide any information that the Secretary may reasonably 
        require for the purposes of implementing this section or 
        determining compliance with rules or orders under this section. 
        Such records shall include periodic reports, records, 
        documents, and other data. Such reports may also include 
        pertinent technical and financial data relating to the 
        quantity, quality, composition volume, weight, and assay of all 
        minerals extracted from the mining claim or lease.
            (2) Availability for inspection.--Upon the request of any 
        officer or employee duly designated by the Secretary conducting 
        an audit or investigation pursuant to this section, the 
        appropriate records, reports, or information that may be 
        required by this section shall be made available for inspection 
        and duplication by such officer or employee.
            (3) Forfeiture.--Failure by a claim or lease holder, 
        operator, or other person referred to in the first sentence to 
        cooperate with such an audit, provide data required by the 
        Secretary, or grant access to information may, at the 
        discretion of the Secretary, result in involuntary forfeiture 
        of the claim or lease.
            (4) Maintenance of records.--Records required by the 
        Secretary under this section shall be maintained for 7 years 
        after release of financial assurance under section 306 unless 
        the Secretary notifies the operator that the Secretary has 
        initiated an audit or investigation involving such records and 
        that such records must be maintained for a longer period. In 
        any case when an audit or investigation is underway, records 
        shall be maintained until the Secretary releases the operator 
        of the obligation to maintain such records.
    (f) Audits.--The Secretary is authorized to conduct such audits of 
all claim or lease holders, operators, transporters, purchasers, 
processors, or other persons directly or indirectly involved in the 
production or sale of minerals covered by this Act, as the Secretary 
deems necessary for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the 
requirements of this section. For purposes of performing such audits, 
the Secretary shall, at reasonable times and upon request, have access 
to, and may copy, all books, papers and other documents that relate to 
compliance with any provision of this section by any person.
    (g) Cooperative Agreements.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary is authorized to enter into 
        cooperative agreements with the Secretary of Agriculture to 
        share information concerning the royalty management of hardrock 
        minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom, to carry 
        out inspection, auditing, investigation, or enforcement (not 
        including the collection of royalties, civil or criminal 
        penalties, or other payments) activities under this section in 
        cooperation with the Secretary, and to carry out any other 
        activity described in this section.
            (2) Secretary of agriculture.--Except as provided in 
        paragraph (3), and pursuant to a cooperative agreement, the 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall, upon request, have access to 
        all royalty accounting information in the possession of the 
        Secretary respecting the production, removal, or sale of 
        hardrock minerals, concentrates, or products derived therefrom 
        from claims or leases on lands open to location under this Act.
            (3) Trade secrets.--Trade secrets, proprietary, and other 
        confidential information protected from disclosure under 
        section 552 of title 5, United States Code, shall be made 
        available by the Secretary to other Federal agencies as 
        necessary to assure compliance with this Act and other Federal 
        laws. The Secretary, the Secretary of Agriculture, the 
        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and other 
        Federal officials shall ensure that such information is 
        provided protection in accordance with the requirements of that 
        section.
    (h) Interest and Substantial Underreporting Assessments.--
            (1) Payments not received.--In the case of mining claims or 
        leases where royalty payments are not received by the Secretary 
        on the date that such payments are due, the Secretary shall 
        charge interest on such underpayments at the same interest rate 
        as the rate applicable under section 6621(a)(2) of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986. In the case of an underpayment, interest 
        shall be computed and charged only on the amount of the 
        deficiency and not on the total amount.
            (2) Underreporting.--If there is any underreporting of 
        royalty owed on production from a claim or lease for any 
        production month by any person liable for royalty payments 
        under this section, the Secretary shall assess a penalty of not 
        greater than 25 percent of the amount of that underreporting.
            (3) Self-reporting.--The Secretary may waive or reduce the 
        assessment provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection if the 
        person liable for royalty payments under this section corrects 
        the underreporting before the date such person receives notice 
        from the Secretary that an underreporting may have occurred, or 
        before 90 days after the date of enactment of this section, 
        whichever is later.
            (4) Waiver.--The Secretary shall waive any portion of an 
        assessment under paragraph (2) of this subsection attributable 
        to that portion of the underreporting for which the person 
        responsible for paying the royalty demonstrates that--
                    (A) such person had written authorization from the 
                Secretary to report royalty on the value of the 
                production on basis on which it was reported;
                    (B) such person had substantial authority for 
                reporting royalty on the value of the production on the 
                basis on which it was reported;
                    (C) such person previously had notified the 
                Secretary, in such manner as the Secretary may by rule 
                prescribe, of relevant reasons or facts affecting the 
                royalty treatment of specific production which led to 
                the underreporting; or
                    (D) such person meets any other exception which the 
                Secretary may, by rule, establish.
            (5) Definition.--For the purposes of this subsection, the 
        term ``underreporting'' means the difference between the 
        royalty on the value of the production that should have been 
        reported and the royalty on the value of the production which 
        was reported, if the value that should have been reported is 
        greater than the value that was reported.
            (6) Hardrock minerals reclamation fund.--All penalties 
        collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the 
        Hardrock Minerals Reclamation Fund established by this Act.
    (i) Expanded Royalty Obligations.--Each person liable for royalty 
payments under this section shall be jointly and severally liable for 
royalty on all hardrock minerals, concentrates, or products derived 
therefrom lost or wasted from a mining claim or lease when such loss or 
waste is due to negligence on the part of any person or due to the 
failure to comply with any rule, regulation, or order issued under this 
section.
    (j) Gross Income From Mining Defined.--For the purposes of this 
section, for any hardrock mineral, the term ``gross income from 
mining'' has the same meaning as the term ``gross income'' in section 
613(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
    (k) Effective Date.--Royalties under this Act shall take effect 
with respect to the production of hardrock minerals after the enactment 
of this Act, but any royalty payments attributable to production during 
the first 12 calendar months after the enactment of this Act shall be 
payable at the expiration of such 12-month period.
    (l) Failure To Comply With Royalty Requirements.--Any person who 
fails to comply with the requirements of this section or any regulation 
or order issued to implement this section shall be liable for a civil 
penalty under section 109 of the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management 
Act (30 U.S.C. 1719) to the same extent as if the claim or lease 
maintained in compliance with this Act were a lease under such Act.

SEC. 108. EXISTING PRODUCTION.

    The holder of a mining claim located or converted under this Act 
for which mineral activities have already commenced under an approved 
plan of operations as of the date of enactment of this Act shall have 
the exclusive right of possession and use of the claimed land for 
mineral activities, including the right of ingress and egress to such 
claimed lands for such activities, subject to the rights of the United 
States under this Act and other applicable Federal law. Such rights of 
the claim holder shall terminate upon completion of mineral activities 
on such lands to the satisfaction of the Secretary.

SEC. 109. HARDROCK MINING CLAIM MAINTENANCE FEE.

    (a) Fee.--
            (1) In general.--
                    (A) Required fees.--Except as provided in section

                date of enactment of this Act, each claimant shall pay 
                to the Secretary, on or before August 31 of each year, 
                a claim maintenance fee of $200 per claim to hold such 
                unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site for the 
                assessment year beginning at noon on the next day, 
                September 1. Such claim maintenance fee shall be in 
                lieu of the assessment work requirement contained in 
                the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) and the 
                related filing requirements contained in section 314 
                (a) and (c) of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
                Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744 (a) and (c)).

                which such adjustment is made.
                    (C) Exception for small miners.--Subparagraph (A) 
                and the assessment work requirement contained in the 
                Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) shall not 
                apply with respect to any claim held by a small miner.
            (2) Moneys received under this subsection that are not 
        otherwise allocated for the administration of the mining laws 
        by the Department of the Interior shall be deposited in the

    (b) Co-Ownership.--The co-ownership provisions of the Mining Law of 
1872 (30 U.S.C. 28 et seq.) shall remain in effect except that the 
annual claim maintenance fee, where applicable, shall replace 
applicable assessment requirements and expenditures.
    (c) Failure To Pay.--Failure to pay the claim maintenance fee as 
required by subsection (a) shall conclusively constitute a forfeiture 
of the unpatented mining claim, mill or tunnel site by the claimant and 
the claim shall be deemed null and void by operation of law.
    (d) Other Requirements.--
            (1) Required filings.--Nothing in this section shall change

        and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744(c)) related to 
        filings required by section 314(b), which remain in effect.
            (2) Mining law of 1872.--Section 2324 of the Revised 
        Statutes of the United States (30 U.S.C. 28) is amended by 
        inserting ``or section 103(a) of the Clean Energy Minerals 
        Reform Act of 2022'' after ``Act of 1993''.

SEC. 110. EFFECT OF PAYMENTS FOR USE AND OCCUPANCY OF CLAIMS.

    Except as otherwise provided in section 101, timely payment of the 
claim maintenance fee required by section 109 or any related law 
relating to the use of Federal land, asserts the claimant's authority 
to use and occupy the Federal land concerned for prospecting and 
exploration, consistent with the requirements of this Act and other 
applicable law.

SEC. 111. PROTECTION OF SPECIAL PLACES.

    (a) Protection of National Park System Units and National 
Monuments.--No permit shall be issued under this Act that authorizes 
mineral activities that would impair the land or resources of a unit of 
the National Park System or a national monument. For purposes of this 
subsection, the term ``impair'' includes any diminution of the affected 
land including wildlife, scenic assets, water resources, air quality, 
and acoustic qualities, or other changes that would impair a citizen's 
experience at the National Park System unit or a national monument.
    (b) Protection of Conservation Areas.--In order to protect the 
resources and values of National Conservation System units, the 
Secretary, as appropriate, shall utilize authority under this Act and 
other applicable law to the fullest extent necessary to prevent mineral 
activities that could have an adverse impact on the resources or values 
for which such units were established.

SEC. 112. SUITABILITY DETERMINATION.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary concerned shall make each 
determination of whether lands are suitable for mineral activities that 
is otherwise required by this Act, in accordance with subsection (b).
    (b) Suitability.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary concerned shall consider 
        lands suitable for mineral activities if the Secretary 
        concerned finds that such activities would not result in undue 
        degradation to a special characteristic described in paragraph 
        (2) that cannot be prevented by the imposition of conditions in 
        the permit required for such activities under title III.
            (2) Special characteristics.--For purposes of paragraph (1) 
        the Secretary concerned shall consider each of the following to 
        be a special characteristic:

undertaking any mineral activities that may have substantial direct, 
indirect, or cumulative impacts on--
            (1) the lands, including allotted, ceded, or traditional 
        lands, or interests of an Indian Tribe or a member of an Indian 
        Tribe;
            (2) any part of any Federal land that shares a border with 
        Indian country, as such term is defined in section 1151 of 
        title 18, United States Code;
            (3) the relationship between the Federal Government and an 
        Indian Tribe; or
            (4) the distribution of power and responsibilities between 
        the Federal Government and an Indian Tribe.
    (b) Multiagency Mineral Activities.--If more than one agency is 
involved in a mineral activity, some or all of the agencies may 
designate a lead agency, which shall be responsible for fulfilling the 
consultation required under subsection (a). An agency that does not 
designate a lead agency shall remain individually responsible for the 
consultation required under subsection (a). All agencies involved in 
the mineral activity shall remain involved in and engaged with the 
consultation process regardless of whether or not a lead agency has 
been designated.
    (c) Limitation.--Nothing in this Act shall exempt an agency from 
additional consultation required under any other law or from taking any 
other consultative actions as required by any other law or agency 
prerogative in addition to those required by this Act. Nor does it 
preclude an agency from additional consultation that complies with 
agency regulations for consultation, advances agency consultation 
practices, or supports agency efforts to build or strengthen 
government-to-government relationships with an Indian Tribe.
    (d) Temporary Waiver.--
            (1) In general.--The agency may temporarily waive the 
        requirements of this title in all or any portion of any 
        emergency area during all or any portion of an emergency 
        period.
            (2) Duration of waiver.--A temporary waiver under this 
        subsection shall end upon the termination of the applicable 
        emergency period.
            (3) Definitions.--For the purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) the term ``emergency area'' means a 
                geographical area in which there exists an emergency or 
                disaster declared by the President pursuant to the 
                National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or 
                the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
                Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.); and
                    (B) the term ``emergency period'' means the period 
                during which there exists an emergency or disaster 
                declared by the President pursuant to the National 
                Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) or the Robert 
                T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.).

SEC. 202. TIMING.

    Consultation under sections 203 and 204 shall be completed before 
any Federal funds are expended for the mineral activity and before the 
issuance of any license.

SEC. 203. SCOPING STAGE CONSULTATION.

    (a) Planning Document.--As early as possible in the planning stage 
of a mineral activity, the agency shall compile a draft of the scope of 
the project. The agency shall make a reasonable and good faith effort, 
consistent with section 800.4(b)(1) of title 36, Code of Federal 
Regulations, as such regulation was in effect on July 6, 2004, to 
identify areas that contain sites important to Indian Tribes whether or 
not such sites are explicitly known to the agency. The agency shall 
make a reasonable and good faith effort to identify any geographic 
areas important to Indian Tribes that might be affected and any other 
anticipated impacts to Tribal interests.
    (b) Initial Consultation Contact.--The agency--
            (1) shall send, via United States mail and, if possible, 
        email, a copy of the planning document and a letter requesting 
        consultation meetings to the relevant Tribal Government 
        officials, including the Tribal leader and all members of any 
        elected Tribal governing body, relevant Tribal governmental 
        agencies (including the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer or 
        cultural resource manager), owners of individual allotments, 
        other stakeholders identified by the Tribe, and relevant non-
        Tribal stakeholders (including the State Historic Preservation 
        Officer and local governments that have jurisdiction on any 
        affected land via agreement with the agency); and
            (2) shall follow up with phone calls to confirm receipt of 
        the documents by all intended recipients.
    (c) Consultation Meeting Arrangements.--The agency shall negotiate 
with the affected Indian Tribes to determine the time, place, agenda, 
travel funds, facilitator, format, and goals of a consultation meeting. 
The agency shall keep thorough documentation of all steps taken to 
contact and engage the affected Indian Tribes in consultation. If, 
after a good faith effort, the agency fails to engage the affected 
Indian Tribes, it may terminate its scoping stage consultation efforts 
by providing all consultation partners with a written notification and 
explanation for its decision to end scoping stage consultation efforts, 
signed by the head of the agency, and proceed to the decision stage 
procedures described in section 204. A good faith effort to consult 
must involve consistent and sustained efforts to contact and engage 
with the appropriate-level officials via the available channels of 
communication (United States mail, e-mail, and telephone).
    (d) Scoping Stage Consultation Meeting.--A scoping stage 
consultation meeting shall begin with confirmation of the format, 
facilitator, and agenda, with adequate time scheduled for introductions 
and for interaction throughout the meeting among participants. Whenever 
possible, Tribal stakeholders (such as allottees or interested Tribal 
members) shall be brought into the on-going planning process directly 
by forming ad hoc workgroups (including Tribal leaders or their 
designees) and, if appropriate, initiating a process for consensual 
development of regulations, such as negotiated rulemaking. A scoping 
stage consultation meeting shall conclude with planning for the next 
meeting, if necessary.
    (e) Termination of Scoping Stage Consultation With a Memorandum of 
Agreement.--
            (1) Termination.--Except as provided by subsection (c), 
        scoping stage consultation shall terminate upon the execution 
        of a memorandum of agreement signed by the head of the agency 
        and the affected Indian Tribes.
            (2) Signatories.--The affected Indian Tribes and the agency 
        may jointly invite additional parties to be signatories of the 
        memorandum of agreement. The signatories have sole authority to 
        execute, amend, or terminate the memorandum of agreement. If 
        any signatory determines that the terms of the memorandum of 
        agreement cannot be carried out, the signatories shall consult 
        to seek amendment of the memorandum of agreement. If the 
        memorandum of agreement is not amended, any signatory may 
        terminate the agreement, and the process will return to scoping 
        stage consultation. The agency shall provide all nonsignatory 
        consulting partners with the opportunity to submit a written 
        statement, explanation, or comment on the consultation 
        proceedings that shall become part of the agency's official 
        consultation record.
            (3) Memorandum of agreement.--The memorandum of agreement--
                    (A) may address multiple activities if--
                            (i) the activities are similar and 
                        repetitive or are multistate or regional in 
                        scope, or where routine management activities 
                        are undertaken at Federal installations, 
                        facilities, or other land management units; and
                            (ii) the scope of the activities is clearly 
                        delineated;
                    (B) may establish standard processes for certain 
                categories of activities determined through 
                consultation and defined in the memorandum of 
                agreement;
                    (C) shall include a provision for monitoring and 
                reporting on its implementation;
                    (D) shall include provisions for termination or 
                reconsideration if the activity has not been completed 
                within a specified time;
                    (E) shall include provisions to address new 
                discoveries, which may include halting the activity and 
                returning to scoping stage consultation;
                    (F) shall include provisions to address changes or 
                modifications to the scope or nature of the activity, 
                impacts or conditions of the project or site;
                    (G) may incorporate relevant Tribal laws, 
                standards, regulations, or policies;
                    (H) may include provisions for the protection of 
                culturally sensitive information; and
                    (I) shall include provisions to address and resolve 
                disputes.
    (f) Termination of Scoping Stage Consultation Without a Memorandum 
of Agreement.--The agency shall make a good faith effort through 
sustained interaction and collaboration to reach a consensus resulting 
in a memorandum of agreement. If, after a good faith effort and a 
reasonable amount of time given the nature and complexities of the 
proposed activity and potential impacts, the agency determines that 
further consultation will not be productive, it may terminate 
consultation by providing all consultation partners with a written 
notification and explanation for its decision, signed by the head of 
the agency, and proceed to the decision stage procedures described in 
section 204. Any decision by an agency to terminate consultation must 
be supported by an adequate documentation and evidence of its good 
faith efforts and the basis for its decision. The affected Indian 
Tribes may at any point decide to terminate consultation. In case of 
termination by either party, the agency shall provide the affected 
Indian Tribes or other affected parties with the opportunity to submit 
a written statement, explanation, or comment on the consultation 
proceedings that will become part of the agency's official consultation 
record.

SEC. 204. DECISION STAGE PROCEDURES.

    (a) Proposal Document.--The agency shall compile a document 
consisting of the plan for the activity, its anticipated impacts to 
Tribal interests, any memorandum of agreement, and any written 
statements made by consulting partners during the scoping stage as 
described in section 203. The agency shall include sufficient 
supporting documentation to the extent permitted by law and within 
available funds to enable any reviewing parties to understand its 
basis. The agency may use documentation prepared to comply with other 
laws to fulfill the requirements of this provision to the extent that 
such documentation is sufficiently pertinent to and focused on the 
relevant issues as to allow reasonable ease of review. The agency shall 
mail and, if possible, email a copy of the Proposal Document to all 
affected Indian Tribes and stakeholders, including those that withdrew 
from the process. At a minimum, the document shall go to the Tribal 
leader, all members of any elected Tribal governing body, and 
stakeholders. The agency shall follow up to confirm receipt of the 
document. After these steps have been completed, the Proposal Document 
shall be published in the Federal Register, subject to the provisions 
of section 207.
    (b) Public Comment Period.--The agency shall provide a period of 
not less than 90 days after publication in the Federal Register for 
comments on the Proposal Document. A reasonable extension shall be 
granted upon request of not less than 30 days by any member of any of 
the affected Indian Tribal governing bodies or a stakeholder.
    (c) Preliminary Decision.--After expiration of the comment period, 
the agency shall prepare a preliminary decision letter, signed by the 
head of the agency. The letter shall state the decision to proceed or 
not proceed with the mineral activity, the decision's rationale, any 
changes in the proposal made in response to comments, and any points 
where the decision conflicts with the expressed requests of any of the 
affected Indian Tribes or stakeholders. It shall particularly address 
why the decision was made to disregard any such requests. The agency 
shall mail and, if possible, email a copy of the letter to all affected 
Indian Tribes and stakeholders, including those that withdrew from the 
process. At a minimum, the letter shall go to the Tribal leader, all 
members of the Tribal governing body, and stakeholders. The agency 
shall follow up to confirm receipt of the letter.
    (d) Final Decision.--The agency shall provide a 60-day period 
following the issuance of the preliminary decision letter for response 
by the affected Indian Tribes and stakeholders. Thereafter, the agency 
shall notify in writing, signed by the head of the agency, the affected 
Indian Tribes and stakeholders, including those that withdrew from the 
process, of the agency's final decision.

SEC. 205. DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING.

    (a) Official Consultation Record.--The agency shall keep an 
official consultation record that allows accurate tracking of the 
process so that agencies and consulting parties can correct any errors 
or omissions, and provides an official record of the process that can 
be referred to in any litigation that may arise. The agency shall 
document all efforts to initiate consultation as well as documenting 
the process once it has begun. Such documentation, including 
correspondence, telephone logs, and emails, shall be included in the 
agency's official consultation record. The agency shall also keep notes 
so that the consultation record documents the content of consultation 
meetings, site visits, and phone calls in addition to information about 
dates and who participated.
    (b) Payment for Tribal Documentation Work.--If the agency asks an 
Indian Tribe for specific information or documentation regarding the 
location, nature, and condition of individual sites, to conduct a 
survey, or in any way fulfill the duties of the agency in a role 
similar to that of a consultant or contractor, then the agency must pay 
for such services, if so requested by the Indian Tribe, as it would for 
any private consultant or contractor. An Indian Tribe may select a 
contractor to perform such work on its behalf, to be paid for by the 
agency.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Each agency shall on a biennial basis 
submit to Congress a report on its consultation activities.

SEC. 206. IMPLEMENTATION.

    Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
head of each agency shall designate an official with principal 
responsibility for the agency's review of existing consultation and 
coordination policies and procedures, and implementation of this Act. 
Not later than 60 days after the effective date of this order, the 
designated official shall submit to the Office of Management and Budget 
a description of the agency's revised consultation process in 
conformity with this Act.

SEC. 207. SENSITIVE TRIBAL INFORMATION.

    (a) Closed Meetings.--Notwithstanding any provision of the 
Administrative Procedures Act, consultation meetings shall be closed to 
the public at the request of the Indian Tribal Government.
    (b) Sensitive Information.--Notwithstanding any provision of 
section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the 
Freedom of Information Act), the Administrative Procedures Act, or any 
other applicable laws or regulations, all information designated by the 
Indian Tribe as sensitive, such as the location of sacred sites or 
other details of cultural or religious practices, shall be deleted from 
any public publication made as part of the consultation process or in 
the process of carrying out the activity.
    (c) Limited Information Access.--The agency, in consultation with 
the Indian Tribe or such Tribe's designee, shall determine who may have 
access to the information for the purposes of carrying out the mineral 
activity.
    (d) Individual Allotments.--Instances where sacred sites are 
located on individual allotments or public domain allotments shall be 
addressed on a case-by-case basis and shall involve the allottees.
    (e) Sacred Sites.--The location and uses of a sacred site shall be 
protected in accordance with this provision and section 111.

the following requirements:
            (A) The permit application, including the site 
        characterization data, operations plan, and reclamation plan, 
        are complete and accurate and sufficient for developing a good 
        understanding of the anticipated impacts of the mineral 
        activities and the effectiveness of proposed mitigation and 
        control.
            (B) The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed 
        reclamation in the operation and reclamation plan can be and is 
        likely to be accomplished by the applicant and will not cause 
        undue degradation.
            (C) The condition of the land, including the fish and 
        wildlife resources and habitat contained thereon, will be 
        restored after the completion of mineral activities.

        the applicant or operator, is ineligible to receive a permit 
        under section 305.
            (H) The reclamation plan demonstrates that 10 years 
        following mine closure, no treatment of surface or ground water 
        for carcinogens or toxins will be required to meet water 
        quality standards at the point of discharge.
    (2) With respect to any activities specified in the reclamation 
plan referred to in subsection (b) that constitute a removal or 
remedial action under section 101 of the Comprehensive Environmental 
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601), the 
Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency prior to the issuance of an operations permit. The 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall ensure that 
the reclamation plan does not require activities that would increase 
the costs or likelihood of removal or remedial actions under the 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 
of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) or corrective actions under the Solid 
Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).

    (f) Temporary Cessation of Operations.--
            (1) Secretarial approval required.--An operator conducting 
        mineral activities under an operations permit in effect under 
        this title may not temporarily cease mineral activities for a 
        period greater than 180 days unless the Secretary concerned has 
        approved such temporary cessation or unless the temporary 
        cessation is permitted under the original permit.
            (2) Previously issued operations permits.--Any operator 
        temporarily ceasing mineral activities for a period greater 
        than 90 days under an operations permit issued before the date 
        of enactment of this Act shall submit, before the expiration of 
        such 90-day period, a complete application for temporary 
        cessation of operations to the Secretary concerned for approval 
        unless the temporary cessation is permitted under the original 
        permit.
            (3) Required information.--An application for approval of 
        temporary cessation of operations shall include such 
        information required under subsection (b) and any other 
        provisions prescribed by the Secretary concerned to minimize 
        impacts on human health, the environment, or properties 
        eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic 
        Places. After receipt of a complete application for temporary 
        cessation of operations such Secretary shall conduct an 
        inspection of the area for which temporary cessation of 
        operations has been requested.
            (4) Conditions for approval.--To approve an application for 
        temporary cessation of operations, the Secretary concerned 
        shall make each of the following determinations:
                    (A) A determination that the methods for securing 
                surface facilities and restricting access to the permit 
                area, or relevant portions thereof, will effectively 
                protect against hazards to the health and safety of the 
                public and fish and wildlife or damage to properties 
                eligible for listing on the National Register of 
                Historic Places.
                    (B) A determination that reclamation is in 
                compliance with the approved reclamation plan, except 
                in those areas specifically designated in the 
                application for temporary cessation of operations for 
                which a delay in meeting such standards is necessary to 
                facilitate the resumption of operations.
                    (C) A determination that the amount of financial 
                assurance filed with the permit application is 
                sufficient to assure completion of the reclamation 
                activities identified in the approved reclamation plan 
                in the event of forfeiture.
                    (D) A determination that any outstanding notices of 
                violation and cessation orders incurred in connection 
                with the plan for which temporary cessation is being 
                requested are either stayed pursuant to an 
                administrative or judicial appeal proceeding or are in 
                the process of being abated to the satisfaction of the 
                Secretary concerned.
    (g) Permit Reviews.--The Secretary concerned shall review each 
permit issued under this section every 10 years during the term of such 
permit, and before approving the resumption of operations under 
subsection (f), such Secretary shall require the operator to take such 
actions as the Secretary deems necessary to assure that mineral 
activities conform to the permit, including adjustment of financial 
assurance requirements.
    (h) Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of Rights.--
            (1) Written approval.--No transfer, assignment, or sale of 
        rights granted by a permit under this section shall be made 
        without the prior written approval of the Secretary concerned.
            (2) Conditions of approval.--The Secretary concerned may 
        allow a person holding a permit to transfer, assign, or sell 
        rights under the permit to a successor, if such Secretary 
        finds, in writing, that the successor--
                    (A) has submitted all required information and is 
                eligible to receive a permit in accordance with section 
                305;
                    (B) has submitted evidence of financial assurance 
                satisfactory under section 306; and

                Secretary.
            (3) Assumed liability.--The successor in interest shall 
        assume the liability and reclamation responsibilities 
        established by the existing permit and shall conduct the 
        mineral activities in full compliance with this Act, and the 
        terms and conditions of the permit as in effect at the time of 
        transfer, assignment, or sale.
            (4) Fee.--Each application for approval of a permit 
        transfer, assignment, or sale pursuant to this subsection shall 
        be accompanied by a fee payable to the Secretary concerned in 
        such amount as may be established by such Secretary. Such 
        amount shall be equal to the actual or anticipated cost of 
        reviewing and approving or disapproving such transfer, 
        assignment, or sale, as determined by such Secretary.
    (i) Public Participation.--The Secretary of the Interior and the

SEC. 305. PERSONS INELIGIBLE FOR PERMITS.

    (a) Current Violations.--Unless corrective action has been taken in 
accordance with subsection (c), no permit under this title shall be 
issued or transferred to an applicant if the applicant or any agent of 
the applicant, the operator (if different than the applicant), any 
claim, license, or lease holder (if different than the applicant) of 
the claim, license, or lease concerned, or any affiliate or officer or 
director of the applicant is currently in violation of any of the 
following:
            (1) A provision of this Act or any regulation under this 
        Act.
            (2) An applicable State or Federal toxic substance, solid 
        waste, air, water quality, or fish and wildlife conservation 
        law or regulation at any site where mining, beneficiation, or 
        processing activities are occurring or have occurred.

SEC. 306. FINANCIAL ASSURANCE.

    (a) Financial Assurance Required.--
            (1) Form of assurance.--After a permit is issued under this 
        title and before any exploration or operations begin under the 
        permit, the operator shall file with the Secretary concerned 
        evidence of financial assurance payable to the United States. 
        The financial assurance shall be provided in the form of a 
        surety bond, letters of credit, certificates of deposit, or 
        cash.
            (2) Covered activities.--The financial assurance shall 
        cover all lands within the initial permit area and all affected 
        waters that may require restoration, treatment, or other 
        management as a result of mineral activities, and shall be 
        extended to cover all lands and waters added pursuant to any 
        permit modification made under section 303(e) or section 
        304(e), or affected by mineral activities.
    (b) Amount.--The amount of the financial assurance required under 
this section shall be sufficient to assure the completion of 
reclamation and restoration satisfying the requirements of this Act if 
the work were to be performed by the Secretary concerned in the event 
of forfeiture, including the construction and maintenance costs for any 
treatment facilities necessary to meet Federal and State environmental 
requirements. The calculation of such amount shall take into account 
the maximum level of financial exposure which shall arise during the 
mineral activity and administrative costs associated with a government 
agency reclaiming the site.
    (c) Duration.--The financial assurance required under this section 
shall be held for the duration of the mineral activities and for an 
additional period to cover the operator's responsibility for 
reclamation, restoration, and long-term maintenance, and effluent 
treatment as specified in subsection (g).
    (d) Adjustments.--The amount of the financial assurance and the 
terms of the acceptance of the assurance may be adjusted by the 
Secretary concerned from time to time as the area requiring coverage is 
increased or decreased, or where the costs of reclamation or treatment 
change, or pursuant to section 304(f), but the financial assurance 
shall otherwise be in compliance with this section. The Secretary 
concerned shall review the financial guarantee every 3 years and as 
part of the permit application review under section 304(g).
    (e) Release.--Upon request, and after notice and opportunity for 
public comment, and after inspection by the Secretary concerned, such 
Secretary may, after consultation with the Administrator of the 
Environmental Protection Agency, release in whole or in part the 
financial assurance required under this section if the Secretary makes 
both of the following determinations:
            (1) A determination that reclamation or restoration covered 
        by the financial assurance has been accomplished as required by 
        this Act.
            (2) A determination that the terms and conditions of any 
        other applicable Federal requirements, and State requirements 
        applicable pursuant to cooperative agreements under section 
        308, have been fulfilled.
    (f) Release Schedule.--The release referred to in subsection (e) 
shall be according to the following schedule:
            (1) After the operator has completed any required 
        backfilling, regrading, and drainage control of an area subject 
        to mineral activities and covered by the financial assurance, 
        and has commenced revegetation on the regraded areas subject to 
        mineral activities in accordance with the approved plan, that 
        portion of the total financial assurance secured for the area 
        subject to mineral activities attributable to the completed 
        activities may be released except that sufficient assurance 
        must be retained to address other required reclamation and 
        restoration needs and to assure the long-term success of the 
        revegetation.
            (2) After the operator has completed successfully all 
        remaining mineral activities and reclamation activities and all 
        requirements of the operations plan and the reclamation plan, 
        and all other requirements of this Act have been fully met, the 
        remaining portion of the financial assurance may be released.
During the period following release of the financial assurance as 
specified in paragraph (1), until the remaining portion of the 
financial assurance is released as provided in paragraph (2), the 
operator shall be required to comply with the permit issued under this 
title.
    (g) Effluent.--Notwithstanding section 307(b)(4), where any 
discharge or other water-related condition resulting from the mineral 
activities requires treatment in order to meet the applicable effluent 
limitations and water quality standards, the financial assurance shall 
include the estimated cost of maintaining such treatment for the 
projected period that will be needed after the cessation of mineral 
activities. The portion of the financial assurance attributable to such 
estimated cost of treatment shall not be released until the discharge 
has ceased for a period of 5 years, as determined by ongoing monitoring 
and testing, or, if the discharge continues, until the operator has met 
all applicable effluent limitations and water quality standards for 5 
full years without treatment.
    (h) Environmental Hazards.--If the Secretary concerned determines, 
after final release of financial assurance, that an environmental 
hazard resulting from the mineral activities exists, or the terms and 
conditions of the explorations or operations permit of this Act were 
not fulfilled in fact at the time of release, such Secretary shall 
issue an order under section 507 requiring the claim holder or operator 
(or any person who controls the claim holder or operator) to correct 
the condition such that applicable laws and regulations and any 
conditions from the plan of operations are met.

SEC. 307. OPERATION AND RECLAMATION.

    (a) General Rule.--(1) The operator shall restore lands subject to 
mineral activities carried out under a permit issued under this title 
to a condition capable of supporting--
            (A) the uses which such lands were capable of supporting

mineral activities beyond that provided for as a temporary cessation 
under this Act, reclamation activities shall begin immediately.
    (b) Operation and Reclamation Standards.--The Secretary of the 
Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture shall jointly promulgate 
regulations that establish operation and reclamation standards for 
mineral activities permitted under this Act. The Secretaries may 
determine whether outcome-based performance standards or technology-
based design standards are most appropriate. The regulations shall 
address the following:
            (1) Segregation, protection, and replacement of topsoil or 
        other suitable growth medium, and the prevention, where 
        possible, of soil contamination.

        the surrounding topography, including as necessary pit 
        backfill.
            (6) Establishment of a diverse, effective, and permanent 
        vegetative cover of the same seasonal variety native to the 
        area affected by mineral activities, and equal in extent of 
        cover to the natural vegetation of the area.
            (7) Design and maintenance of leach operations, 
        impoundments, and excess waste according to standard 
        engineering standards to achieve and maintain stability and 
        reclamation of the site.
            (8) Removal of structures and roads and sealing of drill 
        holes.
            (9) Restoration of, or mitigation for, fish and wildlife 
        habitat disturbed by mineral activities.
            (10) Preservation of cultural, paleontological, and cave 
        resources.
            (11) Prevention and suppression of fire within the leased 
        area.
    (c) Surface or Ground Water Withdrawals.--The Secretary concerned 
shall work with State and local governments with authority over the 
allocation and use of surface and ground water in the area around the 
mine site as necessary to ensure that any surface or ground water 
withdrawals made as a result of mining activities approved under this 
section do not cause undue degradation.
    (d) Special Rule.--Reclamation activities for a mining claim, 
license, or lease that has been forfeited, relinquished, or lapsed, or 
a plan that has expired or been revoked or suspended, shall continue 
subject to review and approval by the Secretary concerned.

            (2) Frequency.--The Secretary concerned shall establish a 
        frequency of inspections for mineral activities conducted under 
        a permit issued under title III, but in no event shall such

        Secretary shall conduct 2 complete inspections annually. Such 
        Secretary shall have the discretion to modify the inspection

                mineral activities due to any violation of the 
                requirements of a permit approved under this Act may 
                request an inspection.
                    (B) Review period.--The Secretary concerned shall 
                determine within 10 working days of receipt of the

                that a violation exists.
                    (C) Imminent threat.--If the person alleges and 
                provides reason to believe that an imminent threat to 
                the environment or danger to the health or safety of 
                the public exists, the 10-day period shall be waived 
                and the inspection shall be conducted immediately.
                    (D) Notification.--When an inspection is conducted 
                under this paragraph, the Secretary concerned shall 
                notify the person requesting the inspection, and such 
                person shall be allowed to accompany the Secretary 
                concerned or the Secretary's authorized representative 
                during the inspection.

                liability for allowing such person to accompany an 
                authorized representative.
                    (F) Anonymity.--The identity of the person 
                supplying information to the Secretary relating to a 
                possible violation or imminent danger or harm shall 
                remain confidential with the Secretary if so requested 
                by that person, unless that person elects to accompany 
                an authorized representative on the inspection.
                    (G) Procedures.--The Secretaries shall, by joint 
                rule, establish procedures for the review of--
                            (i) any decision by an authorized 
                        representative not to inspect; or
                            (ii) any refusal by such representative to 
                        ensure that remedial actions are taken with 
                        respect to any alleged violation.
                    (H) Written statement.--The Secretary concerned 
                shall furnish a person requesting a review a written 
                statement of the reasons for the Secretary's final 
                disposition of the case.
    (b) Monitoring.--
            (1) Monitoring system.--The Secretary concerned shall 
        require all operators to develop and maintain a monitoring and 
        evaluation system that shall identify compliance with all 
        requirements of a permit approved under this Act. The Secretary 
        concerned may require additional monitoring to be conducted as 
        necessary to assure compliance with the reclamation and other 
        environmental standards of this Act. Such plan must be reviewed 
        and approved by the Secretary and shall become a part of the 
        explorations or operations permit.
            (2) Reporting requirements.--The operator shall file 
        reports with the Secretary concerned, on a frequency determined 
        by the Secretary concerned, on the results of the monitoring 
        and evaluation process, except that if the monitoring and 
        evaluation show a violation of the requirements of a permit 
        approved under this Act, it shall be reported immediately to 
        the Secretary concerned. The Secretary shall evaluate the 
        reports submitted pursuant to this paragraph, and based on 
        those reports and any necessary inspection shall take 
        enforcement action pursuant to this section. Such reports shall 
        be maintained by the operator and by the Secretary and shall be 
        made available to the public.
            (3) Failure to report.--The Secretary concerned shall 
        determine what information shall be reported by the operator 
        pursuant to paragraph (2). A failure to report as required by

        Act and subject the operator to enforcement action pursuant to 
        section 506.

        action in a court of the United States to require compliance.
            (3) Exception.--No action may be commenced under subsection 
        (a)(2) against either Secretary to review any rule promulgated

require the filing of a bond or equivalent security in accordance with 
the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
    (f) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall restrict any 
right which any person (or class of persons) may have under chapter 7 
of title 5, United States Code, under this section, or under any other

Secretary or the Secretary of Agriculture or against any other person, 
including any action for any violation of this Act or of any regulation 
or permit issued under this Act or for any failure to act as required

SEC. 505. ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.

    (a) Review by Secretary.--
            (1) Notice of violation.--Any person issued a notice of 
        violation or cessation order under section 507, or any person 
        having an interest which is or may be adversely affected by 
        such notice or order, may apply to the Secretary concerned for 
        review of the notice or order within 30 days after receipt 
        thereof, or as the case may be, within 30 days after such 
        notice or order is modified, vacated, or terminated.
            (2) Review of penalty.--Any person who is subject to a 
        penalty assessed under section 507 may apply to the Secretary

        notification of such penalty.
            (3) Third-party requests.--Any person may apply to the 
        Secretary concerned for review of a decision under this 
        subsection within 30 days after such decision is issued.

        Secretary or resolution of an administrative appeal, final 
        decisions (except enforcement actions under section 507) shall 
        be stayed.
            (5) Public hearing.--The Secretary concerned shall provide 
        an opportunity for a public hearing at the request of any party 
        to the proceeding as specified in paragraph (1). The filing of

        operate as a stay of any order or notice issued under section 
        506.
            (6) Written decision.--For any review proceeding under this 
        subsection, the Secretary concerned shall make findings of fact 
        and shall issue a written decision incorporating therein an 
        order vacating, affirming, modifying, or terminating the 
        notice, order, or decision, or with respect to an assessment, 
        the amount of penalty that is warranted. Where the application

        the Secretary concerned shall issue the written decision within 
        30 days of the receipt of the application for review or within 
        30 days after the conclusion of any hearing referred to in 
        paragraph (5), whichever is later, unless temporary relief has 
        been granted by the Secretary concerned under paragraph (7).
            (7) Temporary relief.--Pending completion of any review 
        proceedings under this subsection, the applicant may file with 
        the Secretary concerned a written request that the Secretary 
        grant temporary relief from any order issued under section 506 
        together with a detailed statement giving reasons for such 
        relief. The Secretary concerned shall expeditiously issue an 
        order or decision granting or denying such relief. The 
        Secretary concerned may grant such relief under such conditions 
        as he or she may prescribe only if such relief shall not 
        adversely affect the health or safety of the public or cause 
        imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources.
            (8) Savings clause.--The availability of review under this 
        subsection shall not be construed to limit the operation of 
        rights under section 504.
    (b) Judicial Review.--
            (1) Court of appeals for the district of columbia.--Any 
        final action by the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture 
        in promulgating regulations to implement this Act, or any other 
        final actions constituting rulemaking to implement this Act, 
        shall be subject to judicial review only in a United States 
        Court of Appeals for a circuit in which an affected State is 
        located or within the District of Columbia. Any action subject 
        to judicial review under this subsection shall be affirmed 
        unless the court concludes that such action is arbitrary, 
        capricious, or otherwise inconsistent with law. A petition for 
        review of any action subject to judicial review under this 
        subsection shall be filed within 60 days from the date of such 
        action, or after such date if the petition is based solely on 
        grounds arising after the 60th day. Any such petition may be 
        made by any person who commented or otherwise participated in 
        the rulemaking or any person who may be adversely affected by 
        the action of the Secretaries.
            (2) Standard of review.--Final agency action under this 
        subsection, including such final action on those matters 
        described under subsection (a), shall be subject to judicial 
        review in accordance with paragraph (4) and pursuant to section 
        1391 of title 28, United States Code, on or before 60 days from 
        the date of such final action. Any action subject to judicial 
        review under this subsection shall be affirmed unless the court 
        concludes that such action is arbitrary, capricious, or 
        otherwise inconsistent with law.
            (3) Savings clause.--The availability of judicial review 
        established in this subsection shall not be construed to limit 
        the operations of rights under section 504.
            (4) Record.--The court shall hear any petition or complaint 
        filed under this subsection solely on the record made before 
        the Secretary or Secretaries concerned. The court may affirm or 
        vacate any order or decision or may remand the proceedings to 
        the Secretary or Secretaries for such further action as it may 
        direct.
            (5) Commence of a proceeding not a stay.--The commencement 
        of a proceeding under this section shall not, unless 
        specifically ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the

        concerned.
    (c) Costs.--Whenever a proceeding occurs under subsection (a) or 
(b), at the request of any person, a sum equal to the aggregate amount 
of all costs and expenses (including attorney fees) as determined by 
the Secretary or Secretaries concerned or the court to have been 
reasonably incurred by such person for or in connection with 
participation in such proceedings, including any judicial review of the 
proceeding, may be assessed against either party as the court, in the 
case of judicial review, or the Secretary or Secretaries concerned in 
the case of administrative proceedings, deems appropriate if it is 
determined that such party prevailed in whole or in part, achieving 
some success on the merits, and that such party made a substantial 
contribution to a full and fair determination of the issues.

SEC. 506. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

    (a) Report to Secretary.--An operator engaging in any mineral

SEC. 507. ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Orders.--
            (1) Notice of violation.--If the Secretary concerned, or an 
        authorized representative of such Secretary, determines that 
        any person is in violation of any environmental protection 
        requirement or any regulation issued by the Secretaries to 
        implement this Act, such Secretary or authorized representative 
        shall issue to such person a notice of violation describing the 
        violation and the corrective measures to be taken. The 
        Secretary concerned, or the authorized representative of such 
        Secretary, shall provide such person with a period of time not 
        to exceed 30 days to abate the violation. Such period of time 
        may be extended by the Secretary concerned upon a showing of 
        good cause by such person. If, upon the expiration of time 
        provided for such abatement, the Secretary concerned, or the 
        authorized representative of such Secretary, finds that the 
        violation has not been abated he or she shall immediately order 
        a cessation of all mineral activities or the portion thereof 
        relevant to the violation.
            (2) Order for immediate cessation.--If the Secretary 
        concerned, or the authorized representative of the Secretary 
        concerned, determines that any condition or practice exists, or 
        that any person is in violation of any requirement under a 
        permit approved under this Act, and such condition, practice or 
        violation is causing, or can reasonably be expected to cause 
        either of the following, such Secretary or authorized 
        representative shall immediately order a cessation of mineral 
        activities or the portion thereof relevant to the condition, 
        practice, or violation:
                    (A) An imminent danger to the health or safety of 
                the public.
                    (B) Significant, imminent environmental harm to 
                land, air, water, or fish or wildlife resources.
            (3) Duration.--
                    (A) Termination.--A cessation order pursuant to 
                paragraph (1) or (2) shall remain in effect until such 
                Secretary, or authorized representative, determines 
                that the condition, practice, or violation has been 
                abated, or until modified, vacated or terminated by the 
                Secretary or authorized representative. In any such 
                order, the Secretary or authorized representative shall 
                determine the steps necessary to abate the violation in 
                the most expeditious manner possible and shall include 
                the necessary measures in the order.
                    (B) Financial assurances.--The Secretary concerned 
                shall require appropriate financial assurances to 
                ensure that the abatement obligations are met when 
                issuing an order under this section.
                    (C) Authority of the secretary.--Any notice or 
                order issued pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) may be 
                modified, vacated, or terminated by the Secretary 
                concerned or an authorized representative of such 
                Secretary. Any person to whom any such notice or order 
                is issued shall be entitled to a hearing on the record.
            (4) Alternative enforcement action.--If, after 30 days of 
        the date of the order referred to in subsection (a) the 
        required abatement has not occurred, the Secretary concerned 
        shall take such alternative enforcement action against the 
        claim holder, license holder, lease holder, or operator (or any 
        person who controls the claim holder, license holder, lease 
        holder, or operator) as will most likely bring about abatement 
        in the most expeditious manner possible. Such alternative 
        enforcement action may include seeking appropriate injunctive 
        relief to bring about abatement. Nothing in this paragraph 
        shall preclude the Secretary concerned from taking alternative 
        enforcement action prior to the expiration of 30 days.
            (5) Failure or default.--If a claim holder, license holder, 
        lease holder, or operator (or any person who controls the claim 
        holder, license holder, lease holder, or operator) fails to 
        abate a violation or defaults on the terms of the permit, the 
        Secretary concerned shall forfeit the financial assurance for 
        the plan as necessary to ensure abatement and reclamation under 
        this Act. The Secretary concerned may prescribe conditions 
        under which a surety may perform reclamation in accordance with 
        the approved plan in lieu of forfeiture.
            (6) Pending review.--The Secretary concerned shall not 
        cause forfeiture of the financial assurance while 
        administrative or judicial review is pending.
            (7) Liability in the event of forfeiture.--In the event of 
        forfeiture, the claim holder, license holder, lease holder, 
        operator, or any affiliate thereof, as appropriate as 
        determined by the Secretary by rule, shall be jointly and 
        severally liable for any remaining reclamation obligations 
        under this Act.
    (b) Compliance.--The Secretary concerned may request the Attorney 
General to institute a civil action for relief, including a permanent 
or temporary injunction or restraining order, or any other appropriate 
enforcement order, including the imposition of civil penalties, in the 
district court of the United States for the district in which the 
mineral activities are located whenever a person--
            (1) violates, fails, or refuses to comply with any order 
        issued by the Secretary concerned under subsection (a); or
            (2) interferes with, hinders, or delays the Secretary 
        concerned in carrying out an inspection under section 503.
Such court shall have jurisdiction to provide such relief as may be 
appropriate. Any relief granted by the court to enforce an order under

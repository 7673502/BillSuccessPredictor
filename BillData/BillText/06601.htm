                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for the prohibition on issuance of licenses authorizing 
  exports of certain defense services to Saudi Arabia, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia Legitimate Self Defense 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that, for purposes of compliance with 
and implementation of section 502 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
(22 U.S.C. 2302; relating to utilization of defense articles) and 
section 4 of the Foreign Military Sales Act (22 U.S.C. 2754; relating 
to purposes for which military sales by the United States are 
authorized)--
            (1) officials from the Department of State and Department 
        of Defense who oversee security cooperation with the Kingdom of 
        Saudi Arabia have an obligation to be alert to and report to 
        the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State any indication 
        that United States-origin defense articles are being used 
        against anything other than legitimate military targets; and
            (2) the Department of State is responsible, under United 
        States law and consistent with United States policy, for 
        investigating such incidents of potential misuse and imposing 
        restrictions, as appropriate, on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 
        instances in which it is suspected of not utilizing United 
        States-origin defense articles consistent with United States 
        law.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States that--
            (1) for purposes of compliance with section 502 of the 
        Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2302; relating to 
        utilization of defense articles) and section 4 of the Foreign 
        Military Sales Act (22 U.S.C. 2754; relating to purposes for 
        which military sales by the United States are authorized), 
        offensive strikes on Houthi (Ansar Allah) ground forces in 
        Yemen by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia do not 
        constitute ``legitimate self defense'', ``internal security'', 
        nor ``preventing or hindering the proliferation of weapons of 
        mass destruction or the means of delivering such weapons''; and
            (2) consistent with section 3(g) of the Foreign Military 
        Sales Act (22 U.S.C. 2753(g); relating to unauthorized use of 
        articles), the United States retains the right to verify 
        credible reports that Saudi Air Force aircraft have been used 
        for purposes other than those authorized under contract terms 
        consistent with the Arms Export Control Act.

SEC. 4. REPORT.

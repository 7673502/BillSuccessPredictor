SEC. 2. AT-WILL EMPLOYMENT FOR FEDERAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH EMPLOYEES.

    (a) At-Will Employment.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, rule, or regulation, and except as provided in paragraph 
        (2), any employee in the executive branch of Government shall 
        be considered at-will, and--
                    (A) may be subject to any adverse personnel action 
                (up to and including removal) for good cause, bad 
                cause, or no cause at all; and
                    (B) may not challenge or otherwise appeal such an 
                action except as provided in subsection (b).
            (2) Limitation.--
                    (A) In general.--An employee may not be subject to 
                any adverse personnel action under this Act for any 
                reason prohibited section 2302(b) of title 5, United 
                States Code.
                    (B) Procedures.--The President shall establish 
                procedures to enforce compliance with paragraph (1), 
                including providing for disciplinary measures against 
                any employee who violates such paragraph. Nothing in 
                this subparagraph shall be construed to grant an 
                employee the right to review or appeal an adverse 
                personnel action outside such procedures.
    (b) Removal of Career Employees.--With respect to the removal of a 
career employee, the following procedures shall apply:
            (1) Before an agency removes the employee, the agency 
        official authorized to propose such action (in this subsection 
        referred to as the ``proposing official'') shall provide the 
        employee with written notification of the proposed removal and 
        the reasons therefore. The employee shall have 14 days to 
        provide a written response, except that the agency head or 
        designee shall have sole and exclusive discretion to alter the 
        response period on a case-by-case basis.
            (2) Under procedures prescribed by the agency head, in the 
        head's sole and exclusive discretion, an agency official other 
        than the proposing official (in this subsection referred to as 
        the ``deciding official'') shall decide whether to remove or 
        retain such career employee. The deciding official shall review 
        the proposed removal and employee response under paragraph (1), 
        and may, in their sole and exclusive discretion, conduct a 
        hearing on the matter. After such review or hearing (as the 
        case may be), the deciding official shall determine whether the 
        employee shall be removed.
            (3) The deciding official's determination under paragraph 
        (2) shall be the agency's final decision unless, within the 7-
        day period following such determination, the agency head or 
        designee reverses the decision, in which case the agency head's 
        or designee's decision shall be the final agency decision.
            (4) An agency's final decision under paragraph (3) shall be 
        final and not subject to any appeal or challenge, unless the 
        President overrules the agency's final decision.
    (c) Application.--Chapter 43 of title 5, United States Code, shall 
not apply to any personnel action taken with respect to an employee 
under this Act.
    (d) Abolishment of MSPB.--On the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Merit Systems Protection Board is hereby abolished. The Chairman of the 
Board may take such actions as are necessary to dispose of the assets, 
obligations, and liabilities of the Board.

                            ``(i) Initial reports.--Not later than 15 
                        days after submission of an agreement described

                        congressional committees a report describing 
                        the estimated financial benefit to Iran from

                        projected GDP growth broken down by government

                        describing trends and changes in Iran's 
                        government spending from the prior year. This 
                        report should include an unclassified estimate 
                        of Iran's expenditures on the Islamic 
                        Revolution Guard Corps, the Basij, overall 
                        military spending, and aggregate support to

agreement has already been submitted to Congress subject to this 
provision of law or whether this agreement is seeking the re-
implementation of a previous agreement.''.

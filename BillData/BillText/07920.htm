                                 A BILL


 
 To create a civil action for non-consensual sexual protection barrier 
                    removal, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stealthing Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Stealthing is a type of sexual violence used to 
        describe non-consensual condom removal during sex.
            (2) In October 2021, California became the first State to 
        outlaw stealthing at the State level. This law creates a civil 
        remedy so that victims of stealthing can sue for damages.
            (3) A 2019 study from Health Psychology reported that 
        almost 10 percent of male participants reported engaging in 
        non-consensual condom removal since the age of 14 years, with 
        an average of 3.62 times and a range of 1-21 times.
            (4) A 2019 study from the Jacobs Institute of Women's 
        Health found that 12 percent of women have experienced 
        stealthing.
            (5) A 2018 Australian study from PLoS ONE found that one in 
        three female respondents and one in five gay male respondents 
        have experienced stealthing.
            (6) Stealthing is a grave violation of autonomy, dignity, 
        and trust that is considered emotional and sexual abuse.
            (7) Stealthing exposes victims to physical risks including 
        pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.
            (8) People engaging in sexual intercourse have the right to 
        make decisions about whether to use a condom or other sexual 
        protection barrier.

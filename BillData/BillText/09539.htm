_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To require the development of an inter-agency strategy and the 
   submission of certain reports relating to the illegal export and 
trafficking of firearms from the United States to recipients in Mexico 
  and certain Central American and Caribbean countries, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Americas Regional Monitoring of Arms 
Sales Act of 2022'' or the ``ARMAS Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Violence in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean 
        is exacerbated by firearms originating in the United States.
            (2) While firearms are trafficked to Mexico from a variety 
        of countries, firearms originating in the United States account 
        for 70 percent of the firearms recovered and traced from crimes 
        in Mexico, according to the 2021 GAO report ``Firearms 
        Trafficking: U.S. Efforts to Disrupt Gun Smuggling into Mexico 
        Would Benefit from Additional Data and Analysis''.
            (3) United States-origin firearm flows contribute to human 
        rights violations, organized crime and gang violence, 
        extrajudicial killings, high homicide rates, domestic violence, 
        and femicides in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.
            (4) According to the Executive Secretariat of National 
        System for Public Security of Mexico, during the period 
        beginning in 2012 and ending in 2021, Mexico experienced more 
        than 168,000 firearms homicides.
            (5) According to the United Nations Regional Centre for 
        Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the 
        Caribbean, firearms are used in 70 percent of homicides in the 
        Caribbean compared to 30 percent globally; the Caribbean has 
        less than one percent of the world's population, but 23 percent 
        of all recorded homicides.
            (6) In an August 2022 press conference, U.S. authorities 
        from Homeland Security Investigations reported a ``marked 
        uptick in the number of weapons'', and an increase in the 
        caliber and type of weapons, being illegally trafficked to 
        Haiti and the rest of the Caribbean.
            (7) The Caribbean Basin Security Initiative of the 
        Department of State that commenced in 2009 is the regional U.S. 
        foreign assistance program that seeks to reduce illicit 
        trafficking in the region and advance public safety and 
        security. The program includes improving the capacity of 
        Caribbean countries to intercept smuggled weapons at airports 
        and seaports, as well as support for forensic ballistics and 
        firearms destruction and stockpile management. Assistance under 
        the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative has also included 
        support for regional organizations, including--
                    (A) the Caribbean Community Implementation Agency 
                for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS), based in 
                Trinidad and Tobago, the lead agency involved in the 
                issue of illicit arms trafficking and increasing the 
                capacity of member states to detect and prevent 
                firearms trafficking; and
                    (B) the Eastern Caribbean's Regional Security 
                System, based in Barbados.
            (8) Firearms trafficking from the United States and firearm 
        violence are key drivers of immigration and asylum claims from 
        Central America.
            (9) Two GAO reports (published in 2021 and 2022, 
        respectively) on firearms trafficking have affirmed that 
        firearms trafficking to Mexico and Central America continues to 
        represent a security concern to the United States, as United 
        States-origin firearms are diverted from legitimate owners and 
        end up in the hands of violent criminals, including drug 
        traffickers and other transnational criminal organizations. A 
        GAO report on the effect of firearms trafficking in the 
        Caribbean has not yet been compiled.
            (10) In these reports, the Comptroller General found that 
        Federal departments and agencies lacked information and 
        analysis of the firearms trafficking networks in Mexico and 
        Central America, that few efforts of the United States 
        Government in the region focused on firearms trafficking, and 
        that, as a result, such agencies lack a detailed understanding 
        of the firearms trafficking that fuels violence and enables 
        criminals in Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and 
        Mexico.
            (11) In the 2022 GAO report ``Firearms Trafficking: More 
        Information Needed to Inform U.S. Efforts in Central America'', 
        the Comptroller General found that efforts of the United States 
        Government focused on firearms trafficking in Belize, El 
        Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras lacked information about 
        relevant country conditions and performance measures to ensure 
        such efforts were designed and implemented to achieve the 
        intended objectives and, as a result, the Comptroller General 
        recommended that the Secretary of State obtain information 
        about the conditions in such countries, to support the 
        development of effective programs to reduce the availability of 
        illicit firearms.
            (12) Data on firearms trafficking is limited and to 
        understand the problem, data compilation is crucial.
            (13) In 2021 and 2022, the annual Country Reports on Human 
        Rights Practices of the Department of State included ``unlawful 
        and arbitrary killings'' as a significant human rights issue in 
        Guatemala, yet despite such inclusion, the Under Secretary of 
        Commerce for Industry and Security has authorized approximately 
        99,270 firearms exports to Guatemala since assuming 
        responsibility for firearms licensing in 2020.
            (14) When firearms were controlled under the United States 
        Munitions List and the licensing of firearms was the 
        responsibility of the Secretary of State, the average number of 
        firearms licensed for export to Guatemala was approximately 
        4,000 per year.
            (15) The current number of exports specified in paragraph 
        (10) represents an extraordinary increase (as much as 25 times 
        the average) from the number specified in paragraph (11), and 
        the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security has 
        only been able to conduct a very limited number of end-use 
        checks, according to the 2022 GAO report ``Firearms 
        Trafficking: More Information Needed to Inform U.S. Efforts in 
        Central America''.
            (16) The proposed security cooperation plan titled ``U.S.-
        Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Heath, and 
        Safe Communities'' and other new initiatives to address root 
        causes of migration from Central America offer an opportunity 
        to reaffirm commitments and strengthen cooperation on 
        addressing firearms trafficking.

SEC. 3. REPORTS AND STRATEGY ON DISRUPTION OF ILLEGAL EXPORT AND 
              TRAFFICKING OF FIREARMS TO MEXICO AND CERTAIN CENTRAL

                in such covered countries to effectively implement and 
                enforce agreements relating to the trafficking of 
                firearms that have been concluded between the United 
                States Government and the national government of the 
                respective covered country.
                    (H) Identifying the origin of trafficked weapons,

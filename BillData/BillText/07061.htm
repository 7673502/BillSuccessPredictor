        taken into account more than once, including by different 
        taxpayers and including by reason of a change in joint return 
        status or dependent status between the taxable year for which 
        an advance refund amount is determined and the taxable year for 
        which a credit under subsection (a) is determined.

comprehensive outreach program to ensure that all taxpayers described 
in subsection (g)(1) learn of their eligibility for the advance refunds

        equal to the loss (if any) to that possession by reason of the 
        amendments made by this section. Such amounts shall be 
        determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on 
        information provided by the government of the respective 
        possession.
            (2) Payments to other possessions.--The Secretary of the 
        Treasury shall pay to each possession of the United States 
        which does not have a mirror code tax system amounts estimated 
        by the Secretary of the Treasury as being equal to the 
        aggregate benefits (if any) that would have been provided to 
        residents of such possession by reason of the amendments made 
        by this section if a mirror code tax system had been in effect 
        in such possession. The preceding sentence shall not apply 
        unless the respective possession has a plan, which has been 
        approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, under which such 
        possession will promptly distribute such payments to its 
        residents.
            (3) Inclusion of administrative expenses.--The Secretary of 
        the Treasury shall pay to each possession of the United States 
        to which the Secretary makes a payment under paragraph (1) or

        administrative expenses of such possession--
                    (A) in the case of a possession described in 
                paragraph (1), by reason of the amendments made by this 
                section, and
                    (B) in the case of a possession described in 
                paragraph (2), by reason of carrying out the plan 
                described in such paragraph, or
        the amount described in subparagraph (A) shall be determined by 
        the Secretary of the Treasury based on information provided by 
        the government of the respective possession.
            (4) Coordination with credit allowed against united states 
        income taxes.--No credit shall be allowed against United States 
        income taxes under section 6433 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
        1986 (as added by this section), nor shall any credit or refund 
        be made or allowed under subsection (f) of such section, to any 
        person--
                    (A) to whom a credit is allowed against taxes 
                imposed by the possession by reason of the amendments 
                made by this section, or
                    (B) who is eligible for a payment under a plan 
                described in paragraph (2).
            (5) Mirror code tax system.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term ``mirror code tax system'' means, with 
        respect to any possession of the United States, the income tax 
        system of such possession if the income tax liability of the 
        residents of such possession under such system is determined by 
        reference to the income tax laws of the United States as if 
        such possession were the United States.
            (6) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 1324 of 
        title 31, United States Code, the payments under this 
        subsection shall be treated in the same manner as a refund due 
        from a credit provision referred to in subsection (b)(2) of

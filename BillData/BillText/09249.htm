SECTION 1. RECOVERY OF CERTAIN COSTS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN COLORADO

    (a) In General.--With respect to hydropower production from any 
Reclamation facility in the Colorado River Basin with hydropower as an 
authorized project purpose, the Secretary of the Interior shall not--
            (1) allocate to preference hydropower contractors who 
        receive power from the applicable Reclamation facility any 
        operations and maintenance costs for any period during which 
        the applicable facility is not able to generate hydropower as a 
        result of dry hydrologic conditions; or
            (2) recover from preference hydropower contractors 
        construction costs for the Reclamation facility for any water 
        year during which, for a period of more than 180 days, no power 
        is produced by the applicable facility.
    (b) Nonreimbursable Costs.--Any costs incurred by the United States 
under subsection (a) shall be nonreimbursable to the United States.
    (c) Effect.--Nothing in this section alters or affects any water 
right with respect to--
            (1) the United States;
            (2) any Indian Tribe, band, or community;
            (3) any State or political subdivision of a State; or
            (4) any person.
    (d) Funding.--In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is 
appropriated to the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of 
the Western Area Power Administration for each fiscal year, out of any 
funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, such sums as are 
necessary for the Secretary of the Interior and the Administrator of 
the Western Area Power Administration, respectively, to carry out 
authorized activities and obligations that would otherwise be carried 
out using amounts collected from preference hydropower contractors as 
payments for the costs described in subsection (a).

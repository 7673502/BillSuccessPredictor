        paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) ensure that the uniform standards require that 
                each manufacturing process required for the manufacture 
                of the construction material and the inputs of the 
                construction material occurs in the United States, 
                without regard to the origin of raw material inputs;

                the direct and indirect jobs benefited or created in 
                the production of the construction material.
            (3) Application.--In carrying out a program described in 
        subsection (d), the head of each Federal department or agency

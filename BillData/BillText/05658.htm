SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Department of Homeland Security, through the 
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is the lead 
        Federal coordinator for securing critical infrastructure across 
        all 16 sectors, in coordination with designated Sector Risk 
        Management Agencies.
            (2) Cyber incidents require technical resources and are 
        only sometimes sector specific.
            (3) The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is 
        the central agency that can quickly analyze and coordinate 
        mitigations when a malicious cyber campaign spans multiple 
        sectors.
            (4) Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
        authorizes the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
        as the Federal civilian interface for multi-directional and 
        cross-sector sharing of information related to cyber threat 
        indicators with and between the government and the private 
        sector.
            (5) Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
        authorizes the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency 
        to facilitate cross-sector coordination to address 
        cybersecurity risks and incidents, including cybersecurity 
        risks and incidents that may be related or could have 
        consequential impacts across multiple sectors.
            (6) Presidential Policy Directive-41 directs the Department 
        of Homeland Security, via the national cybersecurity and 
        communications integration center, to be the lead Federal 
        agency for asset response during a significant cyber incident.
            (7) The functions of the national cybersecurity and 
        communications integration center are carried about by the 
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's 
        Cybersecurity Division.
            (8) Presidential Policy Directive-21 directs the Department 
        of Homeland Security to lead the coordination of critical 
        infrastructure protection among the Sector Risk Management 
        Agencies.
            (9) Section 9002 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry 
        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
        codified the duties of Sector Risk Management Agencies for 
        critical infrastructure sectors, laying out the roles and 
        responsibilities they have in coordinating with the 
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to secure the 
        nation's critical infrastructure.
            (10) Enhancing the security and resilience of our critical 
        infrastructure is a priority for Congress and for the Nation.
            (11) The Department of Homeland Security maintains and 
        continues to build partnerships across all infrastructure 
        sectors to enhance control systems cybersecurity.
            (12) Section 1731 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry 
        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 
        directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report 
        on the potential for better coordination of Federal 
        cybersecurity efforts at an integrated cybersecurity center 
        within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

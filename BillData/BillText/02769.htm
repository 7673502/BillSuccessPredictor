                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund to ensure a safe, 
  sustainable, convenient transportation option for the people of the 
                 United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An effective transportation system for the Nation 
        requires dedicated, predictable Federal funding for various 
        capital and operating expenses, as demonstrated by the Highway 
        Trust Fund, which supports all Federal highway programs, most 
        public transit programs, and many Federal transportation safety 
        programs.
            (2) Intercity passenger rail is the only surface 
        transportation mode in the United States that--
                    (A) does not receive any Federal funding through a 
                trust fund for capital investment; and
                    (B) is completely dependent on annual discretionary 
                appropriations for both its capital expenses and its 
                operating costs.
            (3) In fiscal year 2019, Amtrak experienced record 
        ridership, a historic low operating loss, and a record capital 
        spend rate.
            (4) In markets with sufficient infrastructure and train 
        frequency, Amtrak has proven to be an effective mode of 
        transportation compared to commercial air and bus service and 
        private automobile use.
            (5) Intercity passenger rail offers substantial safety, 
        energy, and environmental advantages compared to most other 
        transportation modes, but decades of in sufficient capital 
        funding has drastically limited the role that intercity 
        passenger rail can play in the Nation's overall transportation 
        network.
            (6) There are critical capital needs for the Northeast 
        Corridor and the National Network, including infrastructure, 
        fleet, stations, and facilities.
            (7) Adding to the urgency of these capital investment 
        needs, due to changing demographics, population growth, 
        urbanization, and changing travel trends, intercity passenger 
        rail will be needed to help move our Nation into the future.
            (8) For these reasons, an Intercity Passenger Rail Trust 
        Fund is needed now, more than ever, to ensure a safe, 
        sustainable, convenient transportation option for the people of 
        the United States.

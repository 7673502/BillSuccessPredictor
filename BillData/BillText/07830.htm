                implementing and enforcing requirements for infant 
                formula that provide a similar assurance of safety as 
                the regulatory requirements of this Act; or
                    ``(B) the distribution and sale of such imported 
                infant formula.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall

        a recall of, or otherwise impose restrictions and requirements 
        under this Act with respect to, infant formula that is subject 
        to a waiver under paragraph (1).''.
    (b) Harmonization.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall, when appropriate, enter into arrangements with other nations for

corresponding regulatory requirements of such other nations.
    (c) Support for the Office of the United States Trade 
Representative.--Section 803(c)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and

            (1) conduct a study comparing infant formula in the United 
        States and infant formula in the European Union, including with 
        respect to nutritional content and applicable labeling and 
        other regulatory requirements; and
            (2) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, complete such study and submit a report on the

biweekly to discuss, with respect to infant formula, pending 
inspections, the findings of pending and concluded inspections, and any 
need for additional inspections.

SEC. 7. IMPORTATION FOR PERSONAL USE.

    (a) In General.--During the period of 90 days following the date of 
enactment of this Act, a person may, without prior notice to the Food 
and Drug Administration, import up to a three-month supply of infant 
formula for personal use from Canada, the European Union, or any 
country that is determined by the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, acting through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, to have 
safety standards for infant formula similar to such standards 
applicable under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
301 et seq.).

subsection (a), the health care provider shall report such adverse 
event to the Food and Drug Administration.

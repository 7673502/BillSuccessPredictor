                                 A BILL


 
     To establish uniform accessibility standards for websites and 
 applications of employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, 
      joint labor-management committees, public entities, public 
  accommodations, testing entities, and commercial providers, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Websites and Software Applications 
Accessibility Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Section 2(b)(1) of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
        of 1990 states that the Act provides ``a clear and 
        comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of 
        discrimination against individuals with disabilities'' (42 
        U.S.C. 12101(b)(1)).
            (2) In 1990, websites and applications were essentially 
        nonexistent, but Congress made clear that the ADA ``should keep 
        pace with the rapidly changing technology of the times'' (H.R. 
        Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 381 (1990)), as reprinted in 1990 
        U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 391).
            (3) Section 102 of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12112), section 202 
        of the ADA (42 U.S.C. 12132), and section 302 of the ADA (42 
        U.S.C. 12182) broadly prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
        disability in regard to employment, services, programs, or 
        activities of public entities, and of goods, services, 
        facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any 
        place of public accommodation, respectively.
            (4) The Department of Justice has promulgated regulations 
        to address the intersection of the ADA and emerging 
        technologies, including the obligation to ensure effective 
        communication with and by individuals with disabilities by 
        using technologies such as video remote interpreting, real-time 
        computer-aided transcription, open and closed captioning, audio 
        description, videophones, captioned telephones, screen reader 
        software, optical readers, and telephone systems that interact 
        properly with internet-based relay systems.
            (5) The activities of a vast number of ADA-covered entities 
        now occur in whole or in part through websites and 
        applications, a shift that has been accelerated by a global 
        pandemic. The digital economy accounts for nearly 10 percent of 
        the United States gross domestic product, and 85 percent of 
        United States adults visit the internet at least once per day.
            (6) Many entities, including those covered by the ADA, rely 
        on third-party technology providers to deliver goods and 
        services via websites and applications, yet these websites and 
        applications are often created and developed in a manner that 
        is inaccessible to individuals with disabilities.
            (7) Despite the ADA's clear language covering all services, 
        programs, and activities of public entities, all goods, 
        services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and 
        accommodations of public accommodations, and all terms, 
        conditions, and privileges of employment and certain actions of 
        employers, including when conducted through websites and 
        applications, most websites and applications contain 
        significant barriers for individuals with disabilities.
            (8) When Congress enacted the ADA in 1990, Congress 
        intended for the ADA to keep pace with rapidly changing 
        technology. The Department of Justice has rightly acknowledged 
        that the ADA requires covered entities to ensure that their 
        websites are accessible to individuals with disabilities.
            (9) Some courts have misconstrued the ADA, saying the ADA 
        does not cover websites despite the clear language of the ADA's 
        provisions.
            (10) Without equal access to websites and applications, 
        many individuals with disabilities are treated as second-class 
        citizens and are excluded from equal participation in and equal 
        access to all aspects of society.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--
            (1) to affirm that the ADA and this Act require that 
        websites and applications used by any covered entity to 
        communicate or interact with applicants, employees, 
        participants, customers, or other members of the public be 
        readily accessible to and useable by individuals with 
        disabilities, whether the entity has a physical location or is 
        digital only;
            (2) to require the Department of Justice and the Equal 
        Employment Opportunity Commission to set and enforce standards 
        for websites and applications and to periodically update such 
        standards;
            (3) to address and remedy the systemic nationwide problem 
        of inaccessible websites and applications that exclude 
        individuals with disabilities from equal participation in and 
        equal access to all aspects of society; and
            (4) to create effective mechanisms to respond to emerging 
        technologies and to ensure that such technologies do not impair 
        the rights and abilities of individuals with disabilities to 
        participate in all aspects of society.

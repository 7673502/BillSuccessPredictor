                                 A BILL


 
To establish a grant program within the Department of Labor to support 
       the creation, implementation, and expansion of registered 
               apprenticeship programs in cybersecurity.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Ready Workforce Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to projections from Georgetown University's 
        Center on Education and the Workforce, the United States was 
        already set to experience a shortage of 5,000,000 workers with 
        postsecondary education or training, including training leading 
        to vocational certificates and apprenticeship training, by 
        2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this problem.
            (2) Registered apprenticeships strengthen the Nation's 
        economy, create pathways to good-paying careers, and help meet 
        the Nation's current workforce demands.
            (3) Apprenticeships can help fill the Nation's workforce 
        needs, including in fields not traditionally linked to 
        apprenticeships, such as cybersecurity.
            (4) The cybersecurity field has a severe shortage in 
        talent, with over 597,000 job openings today, according to 
        CyberSeek, an interactive cybersecurity jobs heat map funded by 
        the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards 
        and Technology (NIST).
            (5) Employers, especially in cybersecurity and information 
        technology fields, may be unfamiliar with the apprenticeship 
        model or do not have the capacity or resources to develop and 
        implement their own training.

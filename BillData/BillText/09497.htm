SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An estimated one out of every three women throughout 
        the world will be beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused 
        in her lifetime.
            (2) Up to 70 percent of women in some countries report 
        experiencing gender-based violence at some point in their 
        lives.
            (3) Intimate partner violence is the most prevalent form of 
        violence against women, preventing them from playing more 
        active roles in the social, economic, and political development 
        of their communities.
            (4) Sexual violence among adolescents and pre-adolescents 
        is alarmingly high. National surveys in Swaziland, Tanzania, 
        Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Haiti have found that between 28 and 38 
        percent of girls and between 9 and 18 percent of boys report 
        experiencing sexual violence before reaching 18 years of age.
            (5) Adult male respondents in six countries who had 
        experienced violence as children were significantly more likely 
        to report perpetrating intimate partner violence themselves 
        according to the International Men and Gender Equality Survey 
        dataset. Analysis by the International Center for Research on 
        Women further shows that men who witnessed violence against 
        their mothers are consistently and significantly more likely to 
        report perpetrating sexual violence. Further, sexually 
        aggressive behaviors start young for these men, and overlap 
        significantly with other forms of physical violence.
            (6) Gender-based violence harms economies and the workers 
        that fuel them. Despite under-reporting, striking statistics 
        document prevalent forms of gender-based violence globally that 
        affect the world of work. Worldwide, women are concentrated in 
        low-wage, insecure jobs in workplaces where they lack 
        bargaining power, protections against gender-based violence, 
        safe and confidential reporting systems, recourse to justice, 
        and access to legal, medical, and psychosocial services.
            (7) Women living in poverty are particularly vulnerable to 
        gender-based violence. Lack of economic opportunities often 
        compel women to use desperate and dangerous means to provide 
        for themselves and their families, risking significant exposure 
        to sexual exploitation and abuse. These women often cannot 
        afford critical social and medical services.
            (8) Research conducted in India, Colombia, South Africa, 
        and Uganda indicates that when women have greater control of 
        assets, they are less likely to experience intimate partner 
        violence. Additionally, when women participate in the economy, 
        they are able to develop a wider support network, which allows 
        them to more easily escape intimate partner violence.
            (9) Gender-based violence impacts livelihoods and food 
        security by reducing work capacity and productivity, including 
        the ability to grow food for consumption. Studies have shown 
        that women affected by gender-based violence are exposed to 
        illnesses and injuries that hamper their ability to work 
        productively and care for their families. Diminished food 
        production consequently increases hunger and women's 
        vulnerability to further violence.
            (10) Country studies indicate that the risk of HIV among 
        women who have experienced violence may be up to three times 
        higher than among those who have not experienced violence. The 
        World Health Organization found that women who experience 
        intimate partner violence are at more than 50 percent greater 
        risk of HIV infection, and in some instances their risk of HIV 
        infection increases four-fold. Women living with HIV are more 
        likely to experience violence than other women, and fear of 
        violence can prevent women from accessing HIV/AIDS information 
        and receiving treatment and counseling.
            (11) Addressing gender norms and inequities is essential to 
        reducing HIV risk and increasing access to HIV prevention, 
        care, and treatment services for women and men.
            (12) Prevalence of sexual and physical violence is higher 
        among persons with disabilities, particularly for adolescents 
        and intimate partners with disabilities, and for men and women 
        with intellectual impairments living in institutions. The World 
        Health Organization reports that rates of gender-based violence 
        are between 4 and 10 times greater among persons with 
        disabilities compared to non-disabled persons.
            (13) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in 
        humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural 
        disasters face extreme violence and threats, including--
                    (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and 
                humanitarian supplies; and
                    (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual 
                exploitation, and abuse.
            (14) Rape and sexual assault against women and girls are 
        used to torture, intimidate, and terrorize communities. Rape 
        and sexual assault are used as tools of war in conflict zones, 
        including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iraq, Syria, 
        Afghanistan, El Salvador, and South Sudan. UNFPA, the United 
        Nation's reproductive health and rights agency, leads the 
        Gender Based Violence Area of Responsibility, which is 
        responsible for global coordination and collaboration on GBV 
        prevention and response in humanitarian settings and is a 
        leading provider of post-rape care and other reproductive 
        health services and commodities in humanitarian settings.
            (15) Child and forced marriage of girls--
                    (A) is a harmful practice that deprives girls of 
                their dignity and rights and creates barriers to 
                development for communities and countries;
                    (B) is projected to affect more than 150,000,000 
                girls who will become brides between 2019 and 2030;
                    (C) can prematurely end girls' education, increase 
                vulnerability to gender-based violence, and 
                significantly raise the risk of maternal and infant 
                morbidity or mortality, including the risk of obstetric 
                fistula and sexually transmitted diseases, including 
                HIV/AIDS;
                    (D) is perpetuated by poverty, a lack of 
                educational or employment opportunities for girls, a 
                lack of legal policies and enforcement of laws, and 
                religious, cultural, and social factors related to 
                girls' perceived lack of value, factors which become 
                particularly acute in conflict and disaster settings 
                where fears of sexual violence and overstretched coping 
                mechanisms often drive child and forced marriage; and
                    (E) child marriage is estimated to contribute, on 
                average, to a loss in earnings of about nine percent 
                for women who married early, which translates into a 
                loss of about one percent in earnings for the entire 
                labor force when factoring in all working adults.
            (16) Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is carried 
        out most often on girls between infancy and 15 years of age and 
        has impacted more than 200,000,000 girls and women who are 
        alive today. FGM/C can cause long-term health problems, 
        including infertility, complications in childbirth, and 
        increased risk of newborn deaths. Mental health is one of the 
        least explored domains of impact of gender-based violence; 
        indeed, self-harm and suicide is the leading cause of death 
        globally for adolescent girls aged 15-19.
            (17) World Bank data shows that gender inequality directly 
        corresponds to increased levels of political and economic 
        instability within states. Gender-based violence impedes 
        women's meaningful participation in social, political, and 
        economic spheres, which is essential to the stability and 
        democratization of a country. Since women disproportionately 
        experience gender-based violence during conflict and post-
        conflict reconstruction, they can play a pivotal role in 
        preventing, mitigating, and resolving conflict, and countering 
        extremism.
            (18) Gender-based violence is a contributing factor to 
        human trafficking. Experts in the field have reported that 
        women and girls who have experienced gender-based violence and 
        live in societies that tolerate severe gender discrimination 
        appear to be more vulnerable to being trafficked. Comprehensive 
        efforts to reduce human trafficking must include efforts to 
        prevent and respond to gender-based violence due to the 
        intertwined relationship of the two crimes.
            (19) Health services are among the first places survivors 
        of violence seek assistance. Health focused nongovernmental 
        organizations and United Nations agencies like UNFPA, the 
        Reproductive Health and Rights Agency, has critical 
        opportunities to reach affected women and girls.
            (20) Gender-based violence also manifests online; gender-
        based cyberviolence is a growing concern, with women and girls 
        disproportionately affected and targeted based on their 
        appearance, activism and sexuality.
            (21) Taking meaningful action to address gender-based 
        violence is an imperative acknowledgment of a woman's agency 
        and personal right to leading a dignified life.
            (22) Addressing gender norms and inequities is essential to 
        reducing HIV risk and increasing access to HIV prevention, 
        care, and treatment services for women and men.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--

                TITLE I--STRATEGY, POLICY, AND PROGRAMS

SEC. 101. UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO PREVENT AND RESPOND TO GENDER-BASED 
              VIOLENCE GLOBALLY.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every 4 years thereafter, the Ambassador-at-
Large, in consultation with the Senior Coordinator, shall--
            (1) develop or update, in consultation with civil society, 
        including service providers, a United States global strategy to 
        prevent and respond to violence against women and girls, using

        root causes of, and provide comprehensive responses to, 
        violence against women and girls;
            (2) submit the strategy under paragraph (1) to the

To direct the Secretary of Defense to carry out a pilot program on the 
  implementation of mitigating actions to address vulnerabilities to 
 critical defense facilities and associated defense critical electric 
                infrastructure, and for other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Guaranteeing Resilient Installations 
for Defense Act of 2021'' or the ``GRID Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM ON IMPLEMENTATION OF MITIGATING ACTIONS TO 
              ADDRESS VULNERABILITIES TO CRITICAL DEFENSE FACILITIES 
              AND ASSOCIATED DEFENSE CRITICAL ELECTRIC INFRASTRUCTURE.

    (a) Two-Year Pilot Authorized.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense, in coordination 
        with the Secretary of Energy, the Secretaries of each of the 
        military departments, and the Secretary of the department in 
        which the Coast Guard is operating, shall carry out a two-year 
        pilot program under which the Secretary shall implement 
        mitigating actions to address vulnerabilities assessed under 
        section 215A of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o-1) at 
        critical defense facilities and their associated defense 
        critical electric infrastructure, after consultation with, and 
        with the consent of, the owners of such facilities and 
        infrastructure.
            (2) Use of grant authority.--In carrying out the pilot 
        program, the Secretary of Defense may make grants, enter into 
        cooperative agreements, and supplement funds available under 
        Federal programs administered by agencies other than the 
        Department of Defense to support mitigating actions under this 
        section.
    (b) Selection of Installations.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
select at least three military installations designated as critical 
defense facilities at which to carry out the pilot program under this 
section. In selecting such installations, the Secretary shall--
            (1) ensure that at least one of the military installations 
        selected is an installation of each of the Armed Forces;
            (2) select installations that represent different 
        challenges or severities with respect to electric 
        infrastructure vulnerability;
            (3) select at least one critical defense facility within 
        the service territory of a Power Marketing Administration;
            (4) provide particular consideration for critical defense 
        facilities and the associated defense critical electric 
        infrastructure that use rural cooperatives or municipal 
        entities for their electricity needs; and
            (5) provide particular consideration for critical defense 
        facilities and defense critical electric infrastructure that 
        have completed an assessment of vulnerabilities and resilience 
        requirements in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and 
        the Secretary of Energy.
    (c) Comptroller General Review.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than two years after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the 
        United States shall--

                this section; and
                    (B) submit to the appropriate congressional 
                committees a report on the results of the review.
            (2) Contents.--The review required under this subsection 
        shall include an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
        mitigating actions taken under the pilot program and the 
        feasibility of expanding the implementation of such mitigating 
        actions at other installations identified under section 
        215A(a)(4) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o-1(a)(4)).

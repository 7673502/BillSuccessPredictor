        classifications at least equal to the wage determination

        Job Corps campus with those occupations most closely correlated 
        with those employed by public education providers in the 
        locality with the goal of ensuring equivalency to the maximum 
        extent feasible.
            (2) Adjustments permitted.--The Secretary may further 
        adjust compensation levels in a contract with an operator or

``Sec. 402. Limit on validity and enforceability
    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this 
title, a predispute arbitration agreement shall have no force or effect 
with respect to a sexual assault claim.
    ``(b) Related Claims.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), and 
        notwithstanding any other provision of this title, a predispute 
        arbitration agreement shall have no force or effect with 
        respect to a claim asserted by a sexual assault victim that is

                prejudice a sexual assault claim that, but for 
                subsection (a), would have been subject to a predispute 
                arbitration agreement--
                            ``(i) the court shall dismiss any other 
                        claim that, but for paragraph (1) of this

                before a Federal court.
    ``(c) Applicability.--An issue as to whether this chapter applies 
to an arbitration agreement or a claim shall be determined under 
Federal law. The applicability of this chapter to an agreement to 
arbitrate or a claim and the force or effect of an agreement to which 
this chapter applies shall be determined by a court, rather than an 
arbitrator, irrespective of whether the party resisting arbitration 
challenges the arbitration agreement specifically or in conjunction 
with other terms of the contract containing such agreement.''.

 To require guidance on extending expiration dates for certain drugs, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Shortages Shelf Life Extension 
Act''.

SEC. 2. EXTENDING EXPIRATION DATES FOR CERTAIN DRUGS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in 
this section as the ``Secretary'') shall issue draft guidance, or 
revise existing guidance, to address recommendations for sponsors of 
applications submitted under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) or section 351 of the Public Health 
Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262) regarding--
            (1) the submission of stability testing data in such 
        applications, including considerations for data requirements 
        that could be streamlined or reduced to facilitate faster 
        review of longer proposed expiration dates;
            (2) establishing in the labeling of drugs the longest 
        feasible expiration date scientifically supported by such data, 
        taking into consideration how extended expiration dates may--
                    (A) help prevent or mitigate drug shortages; and
                    (B) affect product quality; and
            (3) the use of innovative approaches for drug and 
        combination product stability modeling to support initial 
        product expiration dates and expiration date extensions.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, and again 2 years thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to 
the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate 
and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
Representatives a report that includes--
            (1) the number of drugs for which the Secretary has 
        requested the manufacturer make a labeling change regarding the 
        expiration date; and
            (2) for each drug for which the Secretary has requested a 
        labeling change with respect to the expiration date, 
        information regarding the circumstances of such request, 
        including--
                    (A) the name and dose of such drug;
                    (B) the rationale for the request;
                    (C) whether the drug, at the time of the request, 
                was listed on the drug shortage list under section 506E 
                of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
                356e), or was at risk of shortage;
                    (D) whether the request was made during a public 
                health emergency declared under section 319 of the 
                Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d); and
                    (E) whether the manufacturer made the requested 
                change by the requested date, and for instances where 
                the manufacturer does not make the requested change, 
                the manufacturer's justification for not making the 
                change, if the manufacturer agrees to provide such 
                justification for inclusion in the report.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

SEC. 2. INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTION WITH RESPECT TO NEGATIVE OPTION 
              AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO ON THE INTERNET.

    (a) Cancellation of Negative Option Agreements.--No person may 
enter into a negative option agreement with any consumer, unless the 
negative option agreement provides the consumer with a mechanism to 
cancel the agreement in the same manner, and by the same means, into 
which the agreement was entered.
    (b) Requirements for Free-To-Pay Conversion Contracts.--
            (1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person to 
        charge or attempt to charge any consumer's credit card, debit 
        card, bank account, or other financial account for any good or 
        service sold in a free-to-pay conversion contract, unless--
                    (A) before obtaining the consumer's billing 
                information, the person has obtained the consumer's 
                express informed consent to enter into the contract and 
                has provided the consumer with a notification of the 
                terms of the contract, including the fact that--
                            (i) for an introductory period, the 
                        consumer will receive the good or service at no 
                        charge or for a nominal charge; and
                            (ii) after the introductory period, the 
                        consumer will be charged or charged an 
                        increased amount for the good or service; and
                    (B) before the initial charge or initial increase 
                after the introductory period, the person requires the 
                consumer to perform an additional affirmative action, 
                such as clicking on a confirmation button or checking a 
                box, which indicates the consumer's consent to be 
                charged the amount disclosed.
            (2) Mandatory notifications.--After the introductory period 
        in a free-to-pay conversion contract between any person and any 
        consumer, and on a quarterly basis while the contract remains 
        in effect, the person shall provide the consumer with a copy of 
        the notification of the terms of the contract.
    (c) Mandatory Notifications With Respect to Other Negative Option 
Agreements.--
            (1) Automatic renewal contracts.--With respect to an 
        automatic renewal contract between any person and any 
        consumer--
                    (A) between 2 and 7 days before the end of the 
                initial fixed period in the contract, the person shall 
                provide the consumer with a notification of the terms 
                of the contract; and
                    (B) after the initial fixed period in the contract, 
                and on a quarterly basis while the contract remains in 
                effect, the person shall provide the consumer with a 
                copy of the notification of the terms of the contract.
            (2) Continuity plan contracts.--With respect to a 
        continuity plan contract entered into between any person and 
        any consumer, the person shall provide the consumer with a copy 
        of the notification of the terms of the contract on a quarterly 
        basis while the contract remains in effect.
    (d) Mandatory Notifications With Respect to Material Changes in 
Terms of Negative Option Agreements.--In the case of a material change

consumer, the person shall provide the consumer with a notification of 
the terms of the agreement as changed before the change takes effect.
    (e) Regulations.--The Federal Trade Commission may prescribe

        residents of the State may bring an action on behalf of the 
        residents of the State in any United States district court for 
        the district in which the defendant is found, resides, or 
        transacts business, or wherever venue is proper under section

        prior notice is not feasible for the State, the State shall 
        provide notice immediately upon instituting the civil action.
            (3) Intervention by the commission.--The Federal Trade

                powers conferred on the attorney general or other 
                authorized State officer by the laws of the State; or
                    (B) to prohibit the attorney general of a State or 
                other authorized State officer from proceeding in State 
                or Federal court on the basis of an alleged violation 
                of any civil or criminal statute of that State.

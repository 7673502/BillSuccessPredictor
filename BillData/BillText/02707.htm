                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize for a grant program for handgun licensing programs, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Handgun Purchaser Licensing Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) In 2019, 88.4 percent of firearm homicides in the 
        United States in which a firearm type was specified were 
        committed with a handgun.
            (2) Research by top national experts show that--
                    (A) adoption of handgun purchaser licensing laws 
                are associated with significant reductions in firearm-
                related homicides; and
                    (B) repeal of handgun purchaser licensing laws are 
                associated with significant increases in firearm-
                related homicides.
            (3) Research on the effects of the adoption of a handgun 
        purchaser licensing law in Connecticut in 1995 showed--
                    (A) a 27.8-percent reduction in the rate of firearm 
                homicide; and
                    (B) a 32.8-percent reduction in firearm suicide 
                rates.
            (4) Published research has shown that the repeal of a 
        handgun purchaser licensing law in Missouri in 2007 was 
        associated with--
                    (A) a 47.3-percent increase in the rate of firearm 
                homicide; and
                    (B) a 23.5-percent increase in firearm suicide 
                rates.
            (5) In States that have had effective handgun purchaser 
        licensing laws for decades, such as Connecticut, Massachusetts, 
        New Jersey, and New York, the vast majority of firearms traced 
        to crimes originated in States that do not have handgun 
        purchaser licensing laws, which supports the need for handgun 
        purchaser licensing laws in every State.
            (6) Research has shown that States with handgun purchaser 
        licensing laws export far fewer firearms for criminal use in 
        other States than States that lack handgun purchaser licensing 
        laws.

                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit the importation of seafood and seafood products from the 
              Russian Federation, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Russian Federation 
Seafood Reciprocity Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2014, the Russian Federation invaded and annexed the 
        Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine.
            (2) The United States and its allies imposed sanctions with 
        respect to the Russian Federation as a result of that hostile 
        and illegal action.
            (3) In retaliation, the Government of the Russian 
        Federation imposed an embargo on agricultural products, 
        including seafood, imported from the United States, the 
        European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway.
            (4) Before imposing the embargo, the Russian Federation was 
        an important export market for United States seafood products.
            (5) Russian-origin seafood products continue to enter into 
        the United States market without restriction and imports of 
        such products increased roughly 173 percent in value between 
        2013, the year before the imposition of the embargo, and 2020.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF SEAFOOD AND SEAFOOD PRODUCTS FROM 
              THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.

     The importation into the United States from the Russian Federation 
of any article classifiable under chapter 3 of the Harmonized Tariff 
Schedule of the United States is prohibited.

SEC. 4. TERMINATION.

    The prohibition under section 3 shall terminate on the date on 
which the President determines and certifies Congress that the 
Government of the Russian Federation has terminated its prohibition on 
the importation of seafood products from the United States.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    Section 3 applies with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn 
from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date that is 15 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to promote the matriculation, 
and increase in the graduation rates, of individuals with disabilities 
                        within higher education.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Disability Access to 
Higher Education Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Students who are low income attend institutions of 
        higher education at a rate significantly lower than middle- and 
        high-income students.
            (2) Similarly, students who are first-generation college 
        students or are from minority backgrounds attend institutions 
        of higher education at lower rates than the general public.
            (3) Many students who are low income, first generation, or 
        minorities also have a disability.
            (4) In the last decade, both high school and postsecondary 
        graduation rates for students with disabilities were 
        significantly lower than for students without disabilities.
            (5) In 2015, approximately 65 percent of the total 
        population of adults 25 to 34 years old had completed some 
        postsecondary education compared with approximately 44 percent 
        of adults with disabilities in the same age range.
            (6) For students with disabilities who do attend an 
        institution of higher education, only half will receive a 
        diploma compared to 72 percent of students without 
        disabilities.
            (7) Many researchers cite lack of support, such as in-class 
        accommodations, accessible housing, and accessible technology, 
        as a significant challenge as students with disabilities 
        transition from high school to postsecondary education.
            (8) As with their peers without disabilities who are first-
        generation students or come from low-income backgrounds, 
        students who are first-generation or low-income students with 
        disabilities who receive mentoring and support services can 
        successfully prepare for, enroll in, and graduate from 
        postsecondary education programs and gain greater economic 
        control of their lives.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
individuals with disabilities, particularly those who are low income or 
first generation, should be able to attend institutions of higher 
education at the same rate as their peers in the general population.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:
            (1) To provide first-generation or low-income students with 
        disabilities with information, support, and resources to 
        matriculate and complete a course of study at an institution of 
        higher education.
            (2) To encourage and support first-generation or low-income 
        students with disabilities to achieve postsecondary credentials 
        that benefit them and their communities both socially and 
        economically.
            (3) To increase the number of faculty with disabilities in 
        institutions of higher education.
            (4) To provide programs authorized under chapter 1 of 
        subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 
        1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a-11 et seq.) with the resources necessary 
        to support first-generation or low-income students with 
        disabilities to prepare for, enroll in, and graduate from 
        institutions of higher education.

SEC. 3. PREPARING AND SUPPORTING STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES FOR 
              POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION.

    Section 402A of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a-
11) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (c)(4)(A), by striking ``, and Native 
        American Pacific Islanders (including Native Hawaiians),'' and 
        inserting ``, Native American Pacific Islanders (including 
        Native Hawaiians), and individuals with a disability (as 
        defined in section 3 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
        1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102)),'';
            (2) in subsection (g), by inserting ``(except subsection 
        (i))'' after ``For the purpose of making grants and contracts

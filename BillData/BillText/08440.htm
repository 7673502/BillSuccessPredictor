                                 A BILL


 
  To clarify that the Federal Right to Try law applies to schedule I 
substances for which a phase I clinical trial has been completed and to 
provide access for eligible patients to such substances pursuant to the 
                       Federal Right to Try law.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Right to Try Clarification Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, 
        and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-
        176) was enacted in 2018.
            (2) Section 561B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
        Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-0a), as added by the Act described in 
        paragraph (1) (referred to in this section as the ``Federal 
        Right to Try law''), does not exclude from the application of 
        such law schedule I substances for which a phase I clinical 
        trial has been completed.
            (3) Multiple schedule I drugs have progressed through phase 
        I clinical trials and have been designated by the Food and Drug 
        Administration as breakthrough therapies under section 506 of 
        the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356) 
        because of preliminary clinical evidence indicating that such 
        drugs demonstrate substantial improvement over existing 
        therapies, but eligible patients have not been permitted access 
        to these drugs pursuant to the Federal Right to Try law.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO FEDERAL RIGHT TO TRY LAW.

    Section 561B(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 360bbb-0a(b)) is amended by inserting ``any provision of the 
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) that prohibits the 
unauthorized use, possession, distribution, dispensation, or 
transportation of an eligible investigational drug,'' before ``and 
parts''.

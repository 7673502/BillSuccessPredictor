                        after the date of the enactment of this 
                        subsection), subject to the succeeding

                this subsection, the term `prior authorization process'

                and services (other than a covered part D drug) under 
                an MA plan offered by an MA organization for a plan 
                year, a process under which such organization (or a 
                contractor of such organization) determines the medical 
                necessity or medical appropriateness of such items and 
                services prior to the furnishing of such items and 
                services or that otherwise requires an individual 
                enrolled under such plan, or a provider of services or 
                supplier scheduled to furnish items and services to 
                such individual, to notify such plan (or such 
                contractor) prior to such individual receiving such

        any plan year.
            ``(3) Notification requirements.--
                    ``(A) Qualification.--An MA organization shall, not 
                later than 30 days before the first day of each plan 
                year, notify each physician who qualifies for the 
                exemption described in paragraph (1) of such 
                qualification and the items, services, or group of 
                similar services with respect to which such exemption 
                applies for such physician. Nothing in this 
                subparagraph shall preclude an MA organization from 
                notifying a physician of such exemption at additional 
                times throughout a plan year.

                physician described in subparagraph (A) who submits a 
                prior authorization request to an MA organization for 
                an item or service with respect to which an exemption 
                applies under this subsection, such organization shall 
                notify such physician of such exemption as soon as 
                possible (but in no case later than 24 hours after 
                receiving such request).
                    ``(C) Opt out.--Any physician eligible for an 
                exemption under paragraph (1) may voluntarily waive 
                such exemption by providing written notice to the 
                applicable MA organization.
            ``(4) Requirement for coverage and payment.--In the case of 
        a physician who qualifies for the exemption described in 
        paragraph (1) with respect to an item, service, or group of

        coverage and payment for such an item, service, or group based 
        on medical necessity or appropriateness of care.

Congress a report on the potential impacts of the amendment made by

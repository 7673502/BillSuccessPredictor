    Congress finds the following:
            (1) State and county health departments, community health

        diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, 
        prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning 
        services (including contraception), cervical and breast cancer 
        screenings and referrals, and sexually transmitted disease 
        testing.
            (2) Many such entities provide services to all persons, 
        regardless of the person's ability to pay, and provide services 
        in medically underserved areas and to medically underserved 
        populations.
            (3) All funds that are no longer available to Planned 
        Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. and its affiliates and 
        clinics pursuant to this Act will continue to be made available 
        to other eligible entities to provide women's health care 
        services.
            (4) Funds authorized to be appropriated, and appropriated, 
        by section 4 are offset by the funding limitation under section 
        3(a).

SEC. 3. MORATORIUM ON FEDERAL FUNDING TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD FEDERATION 
              OF AMERICA, INC.

    (a) In General.--For the one-year period beginning on the date of 
the enactment of this Act, subject to subsection (b), no funds 
authorized or appropriated by Federal law may be made available for any 
purpose to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any 
affiliate or clinic of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., 
unless such entities certify that Planned Parenthood Federation of 
America affiliates and clinics will not perform, and will not provide 
any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion during such 
period.
    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to an abortion--
            (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
        incest; or
            (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical 
        disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that would, as 
        certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death 
        unless an abortion is performed, including a life-endangering 
        physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy 
        itself.
    (c) Repayment.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the 
Secretary of Agriculture shall seek repayment of any Federal assistance 
received by Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., or any 
affiliate or clinic of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc., 
if it violates the terms of the certification required by subsection 
(a) during the period specified in subsection (a).

appropriated, $235,000,000 for the community health center program 
under section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), in 
addition to any other funds made available to such program, for the 
period for which the funding limitation under section 3(a) applies.
    (b) Limitation.--None of the funds authorized or appropriated 
pursuant to subsection (a) may be expended for an abortion other than 
as described in section 3(b).

SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

funding available in support of women's health.

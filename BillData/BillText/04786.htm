                        or an institution of higher education provided 
                        in accordance with the Americans with 
                        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et 
                        seq.).

                    ``(iii) Disseminate such information to students, 
                parents, and faculty in an accessible format, including 
                during any student orientation and making such

                the institution.
            ``(B) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to 
        preclude an institution from establishing less burdensome 
        criteria than that described in subparagraph (A) to establish 
        an individual as an individual with a disability and therefore 
        eligible for accommodations.''.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF FUNDS FOR THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR INFORMATION 
              AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR POSTSECONDARY STUDENTS WITH 
              DISABILITIES.

    Section 777(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1140q(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``From amounts 
        appropriated under section 778,'' and inserting ``From amounts 
        appropriated under paragraph (5),''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized 
        to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $10,000,000.''.

SEC. 5. INCLUSION OF INFORMATION ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

    Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1094(a)), as amended by section 3, is further amended by adding at the 
end the following:
            ``(31) The institution will submit, for inclusion in the 
        Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) or any 
        other Federal postsecondary institution data collection effort, 
        key data related to undergraduate students enrolled at the 
        institution who are formally registered as students with 
        disabilities with the institution's office of disability 
        services (or the equivalent office), including the total number 
        of students with disabilities enrolled, the number of students 
        accessing or receiving accommodations, the percentage of 
        students with disabilities of all undergraduate students, and 
        the total number of undergraduate certificates or degrees 
        awarded to students with disabilities. An institution shall not 
        be required to submit the information described in the 
        preceding sentence if the number of such students would reveal 
        personally identifiable information about an individual 
        student.''.

SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    None of the amendments made by this Act shall be construed to 
affect the meaning of the terms ``reasonable accommodation'' or 
``record of impairment'' under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) or the rights or remedies provided under 
such Act.

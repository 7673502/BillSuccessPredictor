                coordination on issues relating to those efforts;
                    (B) to provide that focal point, the President 
                should establish, within the Executive Office of the

                the Assistant to the President and Director for 
                International Nuclear Energy Policy'' (referred to in

                        cooperation; and
                            (ii) civil nuclear export strategy;
                    (D) the Office should be headed by an individual 
                appointed as an Assistant to the President with the 
                title of ``Director for International Nuclear Energy 
                Policy''; and
                    (E) the Office should--
                            (i) coordinate civil nuclear export 
                        policies for the United States;

                        nuclear energy nations), associated entities, 
                        and associated individuals with respect to 
                        civil nuclear exports;
                            (iii) coordinate with the officials 
                        described in paragraph (2) to ensure that 
                        necessary framework agreements and trade 
                        controls relating to civil nuclear materials 
                        and technologies are in place for key markets;

                                approach to support appropriate foreign 
                                investment in civil nuclear energy

SEC. 13. UNITED STATES SMALL MODULAR REACTOR INITIATIVE TO INCREASE 
              COMPETITIVENESS AND EXPORT OF UNITED STATES NUCLEAR 
              REACTOR TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Objectives.--The objectives of this section are--
            (1) to expeditiously demonstrate domestic origin small 
        modular reactor technology that is competitive in international 
        markets against designs offered by the Russian Federation and 
        the People's Republic of China;
            (2) expeditiously promote and develop a domestic nuclear 
        supply chain to support near-term international export of small 
        modular reactors; and
            (3) expeditiously develop and demonstrate small modular 
        reactor technology that utilizes reactor fuels derived from 
        low-enriched uranium.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--In addition to amounts 
otherwise available, there are authorized to be appropriated to the 
Secretary pursuant to the funding opportunity announcements of the

activities.

SEC. 14. U.S. NUCLEAR FUELS SECURITY INITIATIVE TO REDUCE RELIANCE ON 
              NUCLEAR FUELS FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and the allies of the United States 
        need to eliminate reliance on the Russian Federation for energy 
        fuels, including all forms of uranium;
            (2) the Department should--
                    (A) prioritize activities to increase domestic 
                production of low-enriched uranium; and
                    (B) accelerate efforts to establish a domestic 
                high-assay, low-enriched uranium enrichment capability; 
                and
            (3) if domestic enrichment of high-assay, low-enriched 
        uranium will not be commercially available at the scale needed 
        in time to meet the needs of the advanced nuclear reactor 
        demonstration projects of the Department, the Secretary shall 
        consider and implement, as necessary--
                    (A) all viable options to make high-assay, low-
                enriched uranium produced from inventories owned by the 
                Department available in a manner that is sufficient to 
                maximize the potential for the Department to meet the 
                needs and schedules of advanced nuclear reactor 
                developers, without impacting existing Department 
                missions, until such time that commercial enrichment 
                and deconversion capability for high-assay, low-
                enriched uranium exists at a scale sufficient to meet 
                future needs; and
                    (B) all viable options for partnering with ally or 
                partner nations to meet those needs and schedules until 
                that time.
    (b) Objectives.--The objectives of this section are--
            (1) to expeditiously increase domestic production of low-
        enriched uranium to prevent the reliance of the United States 
        and, to the maximum extent practicable, ally or partner nations 
        on nuclear fuels from--
                    (A) the Russian Federation;
                    (B) the People's Republic of China; and
                    (C) other countries determined by the Secretary to 
                be insecure supply sources with respect to low-enriched 
                uranium;
            (2) to expeditiously increase domestic production of high-
        assay, low-enriched uranium by an annual quantity, and in such 
        form, determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to meet the 
        needs of--
                    (A) advanced nuclear reactor developers; and
                    (B) the consortium;
            (3) to ensure the availability of domestically produced, 
        converted, and enriched uranium in a quantity determined by the 
        Secretary, in consultation with U.S. nuclear energy companies, 
        to be sufficient to address a reasonably anticipated supply 
        disruption;
            (4) to address gaps and deficiencies in the domestic 
        production, conversion, enrichment, deconversion, and reduction 
        of uranium by partnering with ally or partner nations if 
        domestic options are not practicable;
            (5) to ensure that, in the event of a supply disruption in 
        the nuclear fuel market, a reserve of nuclear fuels is 
        available to serve as a backup supply to support the nuclear 
        nonproliferation and civil nuclear energy objectives of the 
        Department;
            (6) to support enrichment, deconversion, and reduction 
        technology deployed in the United States; and
            (7) to ensure that, until such time that domestic 
        enrichment and deconversion of high-assay, low-enriched uranium 
        is commercially available at the scale needed to meet the needs 
        of advanced nuclear reactor developers, the Secretary considers 
        and implements, as necessary--
                    (A) all viable options to make high-assay, low-
                enriched uranium produced from inventories owned by the 
                Department available in a manner that is sufficient to 
                maximize the potential for the Department to meet the 
                needs and schedules of advanced nuclear reactor 
                developers; and
                    (B) all viable options for partnering with ally or 
                partner nations to meet those needs and schedules.

                                an individual providing a protected 
                                disclosure is required by law, the 
                                recipient shall provide timely notice

        other reprisal against an employee, a former employee, or an 
        individual seeking employment for a disclosure other than a 
        protected disclosure or to modify or derogate from a right or 
        remedy otherwise available to an employee, former employee, or 
        individual seeking employment.
            (2) Relationship to state laws.--Nothing in this section

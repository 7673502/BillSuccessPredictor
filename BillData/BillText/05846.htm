  To direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a program to 
    provide grants to motor carriers and motor private carriers to 
  transport goods during a national emergency or a period of time in 
 which there is a certain percentage of port congestion, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Truckers Responding At National 
Shipping Ports Overcoming Retail Turmoil Act'' or the ``TRANSPORT 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PROGRAM ESTABLISHMENT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program 
to provide grants to motor carriers and motor private carriers (as such 
terms are defined in section 13102 of title 49, United States Code) to 
transport goods from a port to a final destination point or to a point 
that is easily accessible by another form of transport during a covered 
period.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the program established under 
subsection (a) are to--
            (1) anticipate any market disruption caused by a national 
        emergency;
            (2) strengthen the local and regional supply chain; and
            (3) model nimbleness and responsiveness in emergency 
        situations.
    (c) Compliance With Regulations.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, any recipient of a grant under this section who 
complies with regulations set forth in chapter III of title 49, Code of 
Federal Regulations, may operate a commercial motor vehicle in any 
State to transport goods from a port to a destination point during a 
covered period, regardless of whether such recipient complies with 
regulations for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle in such 
State.
    (d) Definition of Covered Period.--In this Act, the term ``covered 
period'' means the period--
            (1) beginning on the date on which the President declares a 
        national emergency under section 201 of the National 
        Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621) and ending on the date on 
        which such national emergency is terminated; or
            (2) beginning on the date on which the Secretary makes a 
        determination that a port is congested by at least 50 percent 
        and ending on the date on which the Secretary determines that 
        congestion at such port is less than 49 percent for at least 60 
        consecutive days.
    (e) Funding.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any 
unobligated funds made available under the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021 (Public Law 117-2) or the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136) may be 
used to carry out this Act.

                                 A BILL


 
To award a Congressional Gold Medal collectively to the Buffalo Soldier 
regiments, authorized by Congress in 1866 to serve in the United States 
 Armed Forces, in recognition of their superior, dedicated, and vital 
                         service to our Nation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Buffalo Soldiers Congressional Gold 
Medal Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1866, Congress passed the Army Organization Act 
        which authorized the creation of six all-Black cavalry and 
        infantry regiments. These regiments remained active until the 
        Army was desegregated in 1951.
            (2) According to legend, American Indians called the Black 
        cavalry troops ``Buffalo Soldiers'' because of their dark, 
        curly hair, which resembled a buffalo's coat.
            (3) The African-American troops accepted the name with 
        pride and honor, as they were aware of the buffalo's fierce 
        bravery and fighting spirit.
            (4) The original six regiments melded into the following 
        four regiments:
                    (A) The 9th Cavalry Regiment assembled in New 
                Orleans, Louisiana in August and September of 1866. 
                They were ordered to San Antonio, Texas in April, 1867, 
                with the mission to maintain order and to secure the 
                road from San Antonia to El Paso.
                    (B) The 10th Cavalry Regiment gathered in Fort 
                Leavenworth, Kansas during the summer of 1867. In 
                August, 1867, they were ordered to Fort Riley, Kansas 
                with the mission of protecting the Pacific Railroad.
                    (C) The 24th Infantry Regiment was organized in 
                1869, forming from the 38th and 41st Colored Infantry 
                Regiments. They served throughout the Western United 
                States, with the mission to protect frontier posts and 
                secure roadways.
                    (D) The 25th Infantry Regiment assembled at Camp 
                William Penn, Pennsylvania beginning in January 1864. 
                They were assigned to numerous districts within the 
                Department of the Gulf with the mission to maintain 
                security.
            (5) Buffalo Soldiers also assisted in the protection of 
        National Parks. They helped fight wildfires and poachers in the 
        Yosemite and Sequoia National Parks and served as park rangers 
        in the Sierra Nevada.
            (6) In the Spanish American War, all four regiments played 
        key roles and fought with distinction, despite facing severe 
        discrimination from the locals.
            (7) At the start of World War I, the Buffalo Soldier 
        regiments were dispatched to locations throughout central 
        United States and into the Pacific, offering logistics and 
        support behind the front lines in the American Expeditionary 
        Forces.
            (8) During World War II, African-American soldiers and 
        units continued to serve proudly under the name ``Buffalo 
        Soldier'', including the 92nd Infantry Division, which was the 
        only Black division that saw combat in Europe.
            (9) In the Korean War, Buffalo Soldier regiments fought 
        throughout the Korean peninsula, from the defense of the 
        ``Pusan Perimeter'' to the counteroffensives which resulted in 
        the end of armed hostilities and the creation of the 
        Demilitarized Zone.
            (10) Buffalo Soldiers had the lowest military desertion and 
        court-martial rates of their time. In recognition of combat 
        valor and their actions beyond the call of duty, many were 
        awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.
            (11) The Congressional Gold Medal would be an appropriate 
        way to shed further light on the service of the Buffalo 
        Soldiers and the instrumental role they played in instilling an 
        approach to inclusivity within our military and the American 
        way of life.

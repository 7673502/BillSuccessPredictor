United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Advantage Loan Program 
Permanency Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) capital access remains one of the largest barriers to 
        overcome for socially and economically disadvantaged business 
        owners as well as for the smallest small businesses;
            (2) according to the Double Jeopardy: COVID-19's 
        Concentrated Health and Wealth Effects in Black Communities 
        study conducted by the Federal Reserve banks, in 2020--
                    (A) firms owned by people of color are more likely 
                to have weak capitalizations, limited bank 
                relationships, and little in cash reserves; and
                    (B) 51 percent of Black-owned businesses have less 
                than 3 months of cash reserves in case of an emergency, 
                which is nearly 7 percentage points higher than their 
                peers;
            (3) according to the Small Business Credit Survey conducted 
        by the Federal Reserve banks, in 2021--
                    (A) 31 percent of firms that sought financing 
                received the full financing sought by the firm;
                    (B) firms owned by people of color were least 
                likely to receive the full amount of financing sought 
                by the firm, with 15 percent of Asian-owned businesses, 
                16 percent of Black-owned businesses, and 19 percent of 
                Hispanic-owned businesses receiving full financing, as 
                opposed to 35 percent of non-Hispanic White-owned 
                businesses receiving full financing; and
                    (C) firms with fewer employees were also least 
                likely to receive the full financing sought by the 
                firm, with 23 percent of businesses with 1 to 4 
                employees and 37 percent of businesses with 5 to 49 
                employees receiving full financing, as opposed to 55 
                percent of businesses with 50 to 499 employees 
                receiving full financing;
            (4) the Community Advantage Pilot Program of the Small 
        Business Administration has helped increase lending backed by 
        the Administration to firms owned by people of color, women, 
        and veterans and firms classified as start ups; and
            (5) from fiscal year 2018 to fiscal year 2022--
                    (A) 13 percent of loans under the Community 
                Advantage Pilot Program went to Black business owners, 
                while 4 percent of loans under the loan program under 
                section 7(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 
                636(a)) (in this section referred to as the ``7(a) loan 
                program'') went to Black business owners;
                    (B) 15 percent of loans under the Community 
                Advantage Pilot Program went to Hispanic business 
                owners, while 8 percent of loans under the 7(a) loan 
                program went to Hispanic business owners;
                    (C) 20 percent of loans under the Community 
                Advantage Pilot Program went to women business owners, 
                while 17 percent of loans under the 7(a) loan program 
                went to women business owners; and
                    (D) 9 percent of loans under the Community 
                Advantage Pilot Program went to veteran business 
                owners, while 5 percent of loans under the 7(a) loan 
                program went to veteran business owners; and
            (6) from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2021, 14 percent 
        of loans under the Community Advantage Pilot Program went to 
        startup business owners, while 7 percent of loans under the 
        7(a) loan program went to startup business owners.

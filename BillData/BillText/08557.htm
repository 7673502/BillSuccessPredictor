                        defined by 21 U.S.C. 863), and results in a

                            (vi) 18 U.S.C. 3607, where the controlled

                        physical force against the person or property 
                        of another.
                    (B) To be considered an expungable event for 
                purposes of subsections (b) and (c)--
                            (i) at least one year must have passed 
                        since the date of the arrest or since the last 
                        docket entry in the case (except for technical 
                        or unrelated entries and other minor issues, as 
                        determined by the court), whichever is latest;

                        evaded prosecution.

SEC. 3. COURT REVIEW FOR EXPUNGEMENT.

    (a) Procedures.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this section, the Chief Justice of the United States shall 
promulgate procedures or practices for the review, expungement, 
sealing, sequester, and redaction of official records pursuant to and 
consistent with this section, and to facilitate the study of such 
records pursuant to subsection (e). In determining such procedures or 
practices, the Chief Justice of the United States and his or her 
designees--which, at the discretion of the Chief Justice, may include 
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the Federal 
Judicial Center, and the Judicial Conference of the United States--may 
consult with relevant entities, including the Attorney General of the 
United States and his or her designees (including Federal Bureau of 
Prisons and any agency, as defined by 18 U.S.C. 6, within the United 
States Department of Justice), representatives of the United States 
Sentencing Commission, representatives of the Federal Defenders 
Organizations, nonpartisan scholars and subject-matter experts, and, 
for purposes of subsection (e), the Comptroller General of the United 
States and his or her designees.
    (b) Review.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment 
of this section, each Federal district shall conduct a comprehensive 
review and issue an order expunging, sealing, and sequestering--
            (1) each official record for an expungable event; and
            (2) other official record(s) related to or referencing an 
        expungable event, unless such other official record is for or 
        related to a felony or a misdemeanor unrelated to marijuana, in 
        which case the court shall redact from such other official 
        record any reference to the expunged official record, and seal 
        or order the sequester of an unaltered nonpublic copy of such 
        other official record.
    (c) Notification of Expungement.--
            (1) Government.--Not later than 7 days after issuing an 
        expungement order, to notify affected criminal justice agencies 
        and to facilitate the timely update of relevant records, the 
        court shall send a copy of the final order to--
                    (A) the Attorney General of the United States, the 
                United States Attorney for that district, and the 
                relevant criminal justice agency (as defined by 
                subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii)); and
                    (B) the relevant criminal justice agency (as 
                defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii)) that serves the 
                jurisdiction in which the expungable event occurred or, 
                if no such agency exists, the chief law enforcement 
                officer of the State in which the expungable event 
                occurred.
            (2) Individuals.--
                    (A) Pursuant to procedures or practices established 
                under subsection (b)(1)--
                            (i) notification about the expungement of 
                        official record(s) and the effect of such 
                        expungement shall be provided to individuals 
                        whose arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal 
                        results or consequences, as defined by 
                        subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), have been 
                        expunged; and/or
                            (ii) a reasonable process shall be 
                        available so that such individuals may inquire 
                        as to whether an arrest, legal proceedings, and 
                        any legal results or consequences have been 
                        expunged and, if so, the effect of such 
                        expungement.
                    (B) Upon motion or written request of an individual 
                whose arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal results 
                or consequences, as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-
                (iii), have been expunged pursuant to this subsection, 
                the court shall send a copy of the final order to--
                            (i) the relevant criminal justice agency 
                        (as defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii)) that 
                        serves the jurisdiction in which the individual 
                        resides or, if no such agency exists, the chief 
                        law enforcement officer of the State in which 
                        the individual resides; and
                            (ii) any local law enforcement agency that 
                        serves the jurisdiction in which the individual 
                        resides.
            (3) No new records.--Any notifications pursuant to 
        paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not be or become publicly 
        accessible records that identify the individual subject of the 
        expungement order, and such notifications shall not be used by 
        criminal justice agencies except for purposes of complying with 
        this section and court orders issued pursuant to it.
    (d) Appeal.--The Attorney General of the United States and the 
United States Attorney for the district from which the expungement 
order was issued may appeal an order, within 60 days of its issuance, 
to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for that district.

SEC. 4. PETITIONING COURT FOR EXPUNGEMENT.

    (a) Petition.--At any point after the date of enactment of this 
section, any individual with an official record for an expungable event 
may file a motion for expungement in the court for the Federal district 
in which the arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal results or 
consequences, as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), was 
obtained. A petition filed pro se shall be construed liberally so as to 
ensure substantial justice (see, e.g., Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 
94 (2007) (per curiam)).
    (b) Service and Response.--The clerk of the court shall serve that 
petition on the United States Attorney for that district. Not later 
than 60 days after service of such petition, the United States Attorney 
may submit a response to the Petitioner's motion.
    (c) Representation and Fees.--No fee shall be imposed for filing a 
petition in any proceeding provided for under this subsection. If an 
indigent Petitioner submits a facially viable claim for expungement 
that nonetheless requires the assistance of legal counsel for purposes 
of filing a superseding petition, presenting evidence in support of the 
petition, or responding to the Government, counsel shall be appointed 
to represent the individual in proceedings under this subsection.
    (d) Evidence and Standard of Proof.--The Petitioner and the 
Government may file with the court relevant evidence relating to the 
petition. Notwithstanding any Federal rule of evidence or procedure, 
the court shall have discretion in admitting and evaluating the 
petition and any evidence submitted by a Petitioner pro se (cf. Haines 
v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972)). The Petitioner bears the initial 
burden to establish a prima facie case that the official record in 
question is for an expungable event, at which point the burden shifts 
to the Government to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that 
the official record is not for an expungable event or the requirements 
for expungement have not been met. If the Government fails to meet this 
burden, or if the Government fails to respond to the petition, the 
court shall enter an appropriate expungement order unless it finds by a 
preponderance of the evidence that the interests of justice and of 
public safety weigh against expungement.
    (e) Expungement Order.--If required under this section, the court 
shall order the expungement, sealing, sequester, and redaction of 
official records of the arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal 
results or consequences, as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii). 
The court may also order the expungement, sealing, sequester, and 
redaction of another official record related to or referencing an 
expungable event, unless such other official record is for or related 
to a felony or a misdemeanor unrelated to marijuana, in which case the 
court shall redact from such other official record any reference to the 
expunged official record, and seal or order the sequester of an 
unaltered nonpublic copy of such other official record.
    (f) Notification of Expungement.--
            (1) Not later than 7 days after granting an expungement 
        petition, to facilitate the timely update of relevant records, 
        the court shall send a copy of the petition and final order 
        to--
                    (A) the Attorney General of the United States, the 
                United States Attorney for that district, and the 
                relevant criminal justice agency (as defined by 
                subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii)); and
                    (B) the relevant criminal justice agency (as 
                defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii)) that serves the 
                jurisdiction in which the expungable event occurred or, 
                if no such agency exists, the chief law enforcement 
                officer of the State in which the expungable event 
                occurred.
            (2) Upon motion or written request of a Petitioner whose 
        expungement petition was granted, the court shall send a copy 
        of the petition and final order to--
                    (A) the relevant criminal justice agency (as 
                defined by subsection (a)(1)(B)(iii)) that serves the 
                jurisdiction in which the Petitioner resides or, if no 
                such agency exists, the chief law enforcement officer 
                of the State in which the Petitioner resides, when such 
                criminal justice agency or chief law enforcement 
                officer is different from those notified pursuant to 
                subsection (c)(6)(A)(ii)); and

                the jurisdiction in which the Petitioner resides.
            (3) Notifications pursuant to this subsection shall not be 
        or become publicly accessible records about the expungable 
        event, including information identifying the individual subject 
        of the expungement order; and such notifications shall not be

that denial to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for that 
district.

SEC. 5. EFFECT OF EXPUNGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--An order of expungement shall restore the affected 
individual, in the contemplation of the law, to the status he or she 
occupied before such arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal results 
or consequences, as defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), for an 
expungable event.
    (b) Self-Disclosure.--An affected individual may treat the expunged 
arrest, legal proceedings, and any legal results or consequences, as 
defined by subsection (a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), as if it never occurred and 
shall not be held thereafter under any provision of law to be guilty of 
perjury, false swearing, or making a false statement for failure to 
disclose, recite, or acknowledge such official record.
    (c) Disqualification.--The fact that an individual has an official 
record, including a conviction, for an expungable event shall not 
operate as a disqualification of such individual to pursue or engage in 
any lawful activity, occupation, or profession.
    (d) Limitations.--
            (1) Expungement under this section does not include an 
        official record of conduct constituting a felony or a 
        misdemeanor unrelated to marijuana, and such official record 
        may be accessed, with any redactions, pursuant to this section 
        or by further order of the court issuing the expungement order.
            (2) Nothing in this section is intended to create a right 
        to compensation, restitution, or any other monetary damages.

        other controlled substances, models for automatic record-
        clearing and for general expungement).

     The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq., and the

this section and to orders or other actions taken pursuant to it.

SEC. 9. INTERPRETATION AND SEVERABILITY.

    (a) Nothing in this section should be construed to preempt or 
supersede the laws of any State with respect to its authority to define 
and enforce the criminal law of that State, or with respect to any 
power reserved to the States respectively, or to the people, or to any 
citizen as a right, under the Constitution of the United States. This 
section does not annul, alter, or affect, or exempt any person subject 
to this section from complying with, the laws of any State, except to 
the extent that those laws are inconsistent with the provisions of this 
section, and then only to the extent of the inconsistency. This section 
shall not in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at 
common law or by statute, but consistent with subsection (d)(3)(B), the 
provisions of this section are in addition to such remedies.
    (b) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to 
any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this 
section, or the application of that provision to persons or 
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid, is not 
affected thereby.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

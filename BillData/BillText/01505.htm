        2021, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of 
        Agriculture shall, by regulation, establish uniform standards 
        for all Interim and Final Reclamation Plans. The goal of such 
        plans shall be the restoration of the affected ecosystem to a 
        condition approximating or equal to that which existed prior to 
        the surface disturbance. Such standards shall include 
        restoration of natural vegetation and hydrology, habitat 
        restoration, salvage, storage and reuse of topsoils, erosion 
        control, control of invasive species and noxious weeds and 
        natural contouring.
            ``(6) Monitoring.--The Secretary concerned shall not 
        approve final abandonment and shall not release any bond 
        required by this Act until the standards and requirement for 
        final reclamation established pursuant to this Act have been 
        met.
            ``(7) Financial assurances.--The Secretary concerned shall 
        not release the financial assurance established for a lease 
        until the operator has paid the inspection fees required under 
        section 4 for the lease covered by the financial assurance 
        instrument.
            ``(8) Bond adequacy review.--The Secretary shall conduct 
        bond adequacy reviews as required under paragraph (4)(D) in 
        accordance with Bureau of Land Management Instruction 
        Memorandum No. 2019-014, dated November 15, 2018.
            ``(9) Orphaned well fee.--The Secretary of the Interior 
        shall collect a per barrel of oil equivalent fee of not less 
        than $0.10 on oil and gas produced from Federal lands for the 
        use of plugging and reclamation of orphaned wells.''.

        annual inspection fee in an amount that, except as provided in

        and is sufficient to recover the full costs incurred by the 
        United States for inspection and enforcement with respect to

    This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable Access to Rural Health

SEC. 2. IMPROVING RURAL HEALTH CLINIC PAYMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 1833(f) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395l(f)) is amended--
            (1) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:
            ``(4) Exception.--In establishing limits under subsection 
        (a) on payment for rural health clinic services provided by 
        rural health clinics which submits to the Secretary a 
        certification that the hospital has a binding written agreement 
        with an outside unrelated party for the construction or 
        purchase of such rural health clinic before March 30, 2021, the 
        Secretary shall--
                    ``(A) during the first year during which such rural 
                health clinic furnishes such services, make payments to 
                such rural health clinic without the application of 
                such limits; and
                    ``(B) during any subsequent year, make payments in 
                accordance with this subsection.
            ``(5) Audit.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this paragraph, the Secretary shall audit the 
        compliance with requirements of paragraph (4) with respect to 
        each rural health clinic to which such paragraph applies. If 
        the Secretary finds as a result of an audit under this clause 
        that the applicable requirements were not met with respect to 
        such rural health clinic, the rural health clinic shall receive 
        payments under this subsection notwithstanding such 
        paragraph.''.
    (b) Utilization of Medicare Enrollment Application Form.--The 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall utilize Form CMS 855A (or 
any successor Medicare Enrollment Application form) to review the 
eligibility of rural health clinics (as defined in section 1861(aa)(2) 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(2))) to receive 
payments pursuant to the mid-build exception described in section 
1833(f)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1935l(f)(4)).
    (c) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
submit to Congress a report on the findings of the audit described in 
paragraph (5) of section 1833(f) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1935l(f)).

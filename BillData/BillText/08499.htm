                                 A BILL


 
     To prohibit the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of the 
  Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of the Interior, the 
Secretary of Transportation, the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
Quality, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from considering, 
  in taking any action, the social cost of carbon, the social cost of

                Budget guidance, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Transparency and Honesty in Energy 
Regulations Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) as a tool to justify Federal actions by the Secretary 
        of Energy, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection 
        Agency, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of 
        Transportation, the Chair of the Council on Environmental 
        Quality, and the Chair of the Federal Energy Regulatory 
        Commission to address greenhouse gas emissions, including the 
        regulation or prohibition of the exploration, mining, 
        production, and use of coal and other fossil fuels as energy 
        sources, the social cost of greenhouse gases, specifically the 
        social cost of carbon, the social cost of methane, and the 
        social cost of nitrous oxide, represents the hypothetical cost 
        of 1 incremental ton of carbon dioxide, methane, or nitrous 
        oxide emissions in a given year;
            (2) the document of the Office of Management and Budget 
        entitled ``Circular A-4'' and dated September 17, 2003--
                    (A) guides Federal agencies on the development of 
                regulatory impact analysis required under Executive 
                Order 12866 (5 U.S.C. 601 note; relating to regulatory 
                planning and review) and other authorities; and
                    (B) instructs Federal agencies to include discount 
                rates of 3 and 7 percent and evaluate the costs and 
                benefits of the regulatory action that accrue to 
                citizens and residents of the United States;
            (3) first developed in 2009 by an interagency working group 
        that included the Department of Energy, the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the 
        Council on Environmental Quality, the estimates for the social 
        cost of carbon and the subsequently developed social cost of 
        methane and social cost of nitrous oxide fail to comply with 
        the 3- and 7-percent discount rates prescribed by the document 
        of the Office of Management and Budget entitled ``Circular A-
        4'' and dated September 17, 2003;
            (4) while the document of the Office of Management and 
        Budget entitled ``Circular A-4'' and dated September 17, 2003, 
        specifies that, in carrying out an evaluation of the global 
        effects of a rule, regulation, or action, the evaluation shall 
        be reported separately from domestic costs and benefits of that 
        rule, regulation, or action, the social cost of carbon, the 
        social cost of methane, and the social cost of nitrous oxide 
        instead calculates the global benefits in lieu of, not in 
        addition to, the domestic costs of a rule, regulation, or 
        action;
            (5) the use of the estimates of the social cost of 
        greenhouse gases, including the estimates for the social cost 
        of carbon, the social cost of methane, and the social cost of 
        nitrous oxide, in the rulemakings and other actions of the 
        Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the 
        Department of the Interior, the Department of Transportation, 
        and the Council on Environmental Quality was without--
                    (A) an adequate opportunity for public notice and 
                comment; and
                    (B) rigorous scientific peer review;
            (6) by Executive order, the interagency working group 
        described in paragraph (3) was disbanded in March 2017, and the 
        related estimates were withdrawn;
            (7) the Environmental Protection Agency developed new 
        estimates in line with the document described in paragraph (4) 
        in EPA-452/R-18-006, dated August 2018, and entitled 
        ``Regulatory Impact Analysis for the Proposed Emissions 
        Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric 
        Utility Generating Units; Revisions to Emission Guideline 
        Implementing Regulations; Revisions to New Source Review 
        Program'';
            (8) Executive Order 13990 (86 Fed. Reg. 7037; relating to 
        protecting public health and the environment and restoring 
        science to tackle the climate crisis), issued on January 20, 
        2021--
                    (A) reconvened the interagency working group 
                described in paragraph (3);
                    (B) directed the head of each Federal agency to 
                include an interim figure for the social cost of 
                carbon, the social cost of methane, and the social cost 
                of nitrous oxide in any consideration of the effect of 
                greenhouse gas emissions in any regulations and other 
                relevant agency actions; and
                    (C) directed the reconvened interagency working 
                group to review and update the methodology and 
                estimates for the social cost of carbon, the social 
                cost of methane, and the social cost of nitrous oxide;
            (9)(A) the use of the interim social cost of greenhouse gas 
        figures was challenged in court and a preliminary injunction 
        was granted by the United States District Court for the Western 
        District of Louisiana on February 11, 2022; and
            (B) the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the 
        preliminary injunction on March 16, 2022;
            (10) the Environmental Protection Agency relied on the 
        interagency working group interim estimate of the social cost 
        of methane, without appropriate peer review or opportunity for 
        public notice and comment, in attempting to justify the costs 
        and benefits of the proposed rule entitled ``Standards of 
        Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and 
        Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas 
        Sector Climate Review'' (86 Fed. Reg. 63110 (November 15, 
        2021));
            (11) prior to the 2017 disbandment of the interagency 
        working group described in paragraph (3), the Department of the 
        Interior used the social cost of methane estimate to justify 
        the costs and benefits of the final rule entitled ``Waste 
        Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource 
        Conservation'' (81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (November 18, 2016));
            (12) court filings note that various agencies have 38 
        pending regulatory actions that rely on the interim social cost 
        of greenhouse gases figures; and
            (13) continued use of the social cost of greenhouse gases, 
        including the social cost of carbon, the social cost of 
        methane, and the social cost of nitrous oxide by the Department 
        of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department 
        of the Interior, the Department of Transportation, the Council 
        on Environmental Quality, and the Federal Energy Regulatory 
        Commission ignores sound science.

                rehabilitation expenditures otherwise taken into 
                account under subsection (e) (determined without regard 
                to this paragraph and subsection (d)(5)(B)), shall be

                amount in subparagraph (A)(i) for such calendar year 
                shall be taken into account as an increase in the 
                healthcare-oriented housing amount for the following 
                calendar year. The preceding sentence shall not result 
                in an increase with respect to any calendar year after

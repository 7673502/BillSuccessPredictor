    (a) Authority To Declare an Extraordinary Migration Event.--
            (1) In general.--The President, at the request of the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security or a State or local government 
        entity, may declare an ``extraordinary migration event'' that 
        is of such a magnitude that an appropriate, timely, or 
        effective response is beyond the scope of the existing 
        infrastructure and staffing levels of the Department of 
        Homeland Security or State or local governmental resources. The 
        Secretary, in consultation with the heads of relevant Federal, 
        State, and local agencies, should establish quantitative and 
        qualitative parameters described in paragraph (2) to determine 
        if an event is an extraordinary migration event and when such a 
        declaration of such an event should terminate.
            (2) Parameters described.--Quantitative and qualitative 
        parameters described in this paragraph may include the 
        following:
                    (A) The average number of border apprehensions per 
                week by U.S. Customs and Border Protection compared to 
                historical data.
                    (B) Staffing and resources available to the U.S. 
                Border Patrol operating in sectors affected by a 
                migrant surge.
                    (C) Migrant population composition.
                    (D) Projected or assessed changes in any of the 
                parameters described in this paragraph.
            (3) Review and revision.--The Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, in consultation with the heads of relevant Federal, 
        State, and local agencies, should, not less frequently than 
        annually, review and, if appropriate, revise the quantitative 
        and qualitative parameters described in paragraph (2).
            (4) Notification.--If a quantitative or qualitative 
        parameter described in paragraph (2) is revised pursuant to 
        paragraph (3), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, not 
        later than 30 days after each such revision notify the 
        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives 
        and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs 
        of the Senate of each such revision.

        the Secretary of Homeland Security and shall--
                    (A) conduct an appraisal of the types of resources, 
                including relating to transportation, facilities, 
                personnel, health, and intelligence, necessary to 
                respond to such an event;
                    (B) coordinate--
                            (i) the administration of assistance and 
                        support offered to the Department by other

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:

        culture, ecology, and the economy.
            (2) Salmon are especially important to Indian tribes, many 
        of which consider salmon to be sacred and central to their 
        culture, ceremonies, and subsistence.
            (3) Such Indian tribes have significant leadership and 
        expertise with respect to salmon.

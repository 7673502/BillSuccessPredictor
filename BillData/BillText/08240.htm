                                 A BILL


 
             To combat military reliance on Russian energy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Energy Security Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. COMBATING MILITARY RELIANCE ON RUSSIAN ENERGY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) reliance on Russian energy poses a critical challenge 
        for national security activities in area of responsibility of 
        the United States European Command; and
            (2) in order to reduce the vulnerability of United States 
        military facilities to disruptions caused by reliance on 
        Russian energy, the Department of Defense should establish and 
        implement plans to reduce reliance on Russian energy for all 
        main operating bases in area of responsibility of the United 
        States European Command.
    (b) Eliminating Use of Russian Energy.--It shall be the goal of the 
Department of Defense to eliminate the use of Russian energy on each 
main operating base in the area of responsibility of the United States 
European Command by not later than five years after the date of the 
completion of an installation energy plan for such base, as required 
under this section.
    (c) Installation Energy Plans for Main Operating Bases.--
            (1) Identification of installations.--Not later than June 
        1, 2023, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
        congressional defense committees a list of main operating bases 
        within the area of responsibility of the United States European 
        Command ranked according to mission criticality and 
        vulnerability to energy disruption.
            (2) Submittal of plans.--Not later than 12 months after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense 
        shall submit to the congressional defense committees--
                    (A) an installation energy plan for each main 
                operating base on the list submitted under paragraph 
                (1); and
                    (B) an assessment of the feasibility of reaching 
                the goal for the elimination of the use of Russian 
                energy pursuant to subsection (b) on that base, 
                including--
                            (i) a description of the steps that would 
                        be required to meet such goal; and
                            (ii) an analysis of the effects such steps 
                        would have on the national security of the 
                        United States.
    (d) Content of Plans.--Each installation energy plan for a main 
operating base shall include each of the following with respect to that 
base:
            (1) An assessment of the energy resilience requirements, 
        resiliency gaps, and energy-related cybersecurity requirements 
        of the base, including with respect to operational technology, 
        control systems, and facilities-related control systems.
            (2) An identification of investments in technology required 
        to improve energy resilience, reduce demand, strengthen energy 
        conservation, and support mission readiness.
            (3) An identification of investments in infrastructure, 
        including microgrids, required to strengthen energy resilience 
        and mitigate risk due to grid disturbance.
            (4) Recommendations related to opportunities for the use of 
        renewable energy, clean energy, nuclear energy, and energy 
        storage projects to reduce dependence on natural gas.
            (5) An assessment of how the requirements and 
        recommendations included pursuant to paragraphs (2) through (4) 
        interact with the energy policies of the country where the base 
        is located, both at present and into the future.
    (e) Implementation of Plans.--
            (1) Deadline for implementation.--Not later than 30 days 
        after the date on which the Secretary submits an installation 
        energy plan for a base under subsection (c)(2), the Secretary 
        shall--
                    (A) begin implementing the plan; and
                    (B) provide to the congressional defense committees 
                a briefing on the contents of the plan and the strategy 
                of the Secretary for implementing the mitigation 
                measures identified in the plan.
            (2) Prioritization of certain projects.--In implementing an 
        installation energy plan for a base under this section, the 
        Secretary shall prioritize projects requested under section 
        2914 of title 10, United States Code, to mitigate assessed 
        risks and improve energy resilience, energy security, and 
        energy conservation at the base.
            (3) Nonapplication of certain other authorities.--
        Subsection (d) of section 2914 of title 10, United States Code, 
        shall not apply with respect to any project carried out 
        pursuant to this section or pursuant to an installation energy 
        plan for a base under this section.
    (f) Policy for Future Bases.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
establish a policy to ensure that any new military base in the area of 
responsibility of the United States European Command is established in 
a manner that proactively includes the consideration of energy 
security, energy resilience, and mitigation of risk due to energy 
disruption.
    (g) Annual Congressional Briefings.--The Secretary of Defense shall 
provide to the congressional defense committees annual briefings on the 
installation energy plans required under this section. Such briefings 
shall include an identification of each of the following:

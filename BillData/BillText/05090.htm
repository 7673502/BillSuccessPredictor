SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Biofuel Cell Research Act''.

SEC. 2. BIOFUEL AND FUEL CELL VEHICLE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND 
              DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.

    Section 932 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 16232) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(i) Biofuel and Fuel Cell Vehicle Research, Development, and 
Demonstration Program.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a 
        research, development, and demonstration program for a

        fuel source for a vehicle.
            ``(2) Research goals.--The Secretary shall establish 
        interim research and development goals that will result in the

        utilize biofuels as a fuel source, including the following:
                    ``(A) Innovative stack designs and components, 
                including--
                            ``(i) catalysts;
                            ``(ii) membranes and electrolytes;

                    ``(D) Systems designs and component integration 
                that optimize efficiency, cost, transient response, and 
                lifetime.
            ``(3) Coordination.--In carrying out the activities under 
        this section, the Secretary shall coordinate with--

To protect the constitutional right to marry a person of another race, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Loving v. Virginia Codification Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1 (1967)), the United 
        States Supreme Court stated ``Marriage is one of the `basic 
        civil rights of man'''.
            (2) In Loving v. Virginia (388 U.S. 1 (1967)), the United 
        States Supreme Court stated ``Under the Constitution, the 
        freedom to marry or not marry a person of another race resides 
        with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State''.

SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF RIGHT TO MARRY.

    (a) In General.--A State may not enact a law or regulation that 
infringes on the right to marry or not marry a person of another race.
    (b) Enforcement by Attorney General.--The Attorney General may 
commence a civil action on behalf of the United States against any 
State that violates, or against any government official that implements 
or enforces a law or regulation that violates subsection (a). The court 
shall hold unlawful and set aside the law or regulation if it is in 
violation of subsection (a).
    (c) Private Right of Action.--A violation of subsection (a) 
constitutes a deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities 
secured by the Constitution and laws for purposes of section 1979 of 
the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1983), and a 
person injured thereby may bring an action under such section.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

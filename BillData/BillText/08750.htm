            (2) Extension.--The Secretary may extend the duration of 
        the pilot program under paragraph (1) for an additional three-

        that it is appropriate to do so.

                    (B) Veterans receiving nursing home care.--The

                percentage of veterans who are currently receiving 
                nursing home care through the Department and would be 
                eligible to receive assisted living services under the 
                pilot program.
            (2) Facilities.--
                    (A) In general.--Within each Veterans Integrated

                Regulations, or successor regulations, and any 
                additional standards of care as the Secretary may 
                specify.
            (3) Inspection.--The Secretary shall inspect facilities at 
        which veterans are placed under the pilot program under

                    (A) with respect to a facility that is a State 
                home, not less frequently than annually and in the same 
                manner as the Secretary conducts inspection of State 
                homes under section 1742 of title 38, United States 
                Code; and
                    (B) with respect to any other facility, not less

                section 1730 of such title.
            (4) Payment to certain facilities.--

                participating in the pilot program at the State home 
                that is--
                            (i) greater than the per diem for 
                        domiciliary care at the State home, if 
                        applicable; and
                            (ii) less than the per diem for nursing 
                        home care at the State home.
                    (B) Community assisted living facilities.--In the 
                case of a facility participating in the pilot program 
                that is a community assisted living facility, the 
                Secretary shall pay to the facility an amount that is 
                less than the average rate paid by the Department for 
                placement in a community nursing home in the same 
                Veterans Integrated Service Network.
    (d) Continuity of Care.--Upon the termination of the pilot program

        to receive assisted living services at the site they were 
        assigned to under the pilot program, at the expense of the 
        Department; and
            (2) for such veterans who do not opt to continue to receive 
        such services--
                    (A) ensure such veterans do not experience lapses 
                in care; and
                    (B) provide such veterans with information on, and 
                enroll participants in, other long-term care options

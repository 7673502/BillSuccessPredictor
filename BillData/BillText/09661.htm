        individual may be subject to a discharge from, reassessment of 
        eligibility for, or reduction of benefits under, the program of 
        comprehensive assistance for family caregivers on the sole 
        basis of the final rule specified in subsection (a);
            (2) provide to each such legacy participant information 
        regarding continued eligibility for such program under the 
        interim final rule of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        relating to ``Extension of Program of Comprehensive Assistance 
        for Family Caregivers; Eligibility for Legacy Participants and 
        Legacy Applicants'' (issued on September 14, 2022), or any 
        related successor rule; and
            (3) take such other steps as may be necessary to ensure 
        that legacy participants receive the most up-to-date 
        information regarding eligibility for such program.

the outreach requirements under subsection (c), the Secretary of

            (1) The term ``family caregiver'' has the meaning given 
        such term in section 1720G(d) of title 38, United States Code.
            (2) The term ``legacy participant'' means, with respect to 
        the program of comprehensive assistance for family caregivers,

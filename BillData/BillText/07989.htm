reasons for such discontinuance or interruption.
    ``(b) Timing.--Except as provided in subsection (g), a notice 
required under subsection (a) shall be submitted to the Secretary--

        information described in subsection (d), except that, if the 
        Secretary determines that the letter under paragraph (1) was 
        issued in error or, after review of such response, the person 
        had a reasonable basis for not notifying as required under 
        subsection (a), the requirements of this paragraph shall not 
        apply.

        than one food, or food category, manufactured at the same 
        establishment; and

                the manufacturer to fulfill contractual obligations or 
                meet expected demand for its product; and
                    ``(B) does not include interruptions in

Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 331) is amended by adding at the end the

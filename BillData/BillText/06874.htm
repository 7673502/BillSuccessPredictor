on natural gas, petroleum, and nuclear fuel produced in Russia by--
            (1) developing, producing, or procuring resources, 
        materials, or equipment that can reduce an allied European 
        country's reliance on natural gas, petroleum, or nuclear fuel 
        produced in Russia;
            (2) providing to an allied European country, under such 
        terms and conditions as the Secretary of Energy determines 
        appropriate, resources, materials, or equipment that can reduce

        petroleum, or nuclear fuel produced in Russia;
            (3) issuing grants, loans, or loan guarantees to carry out 
        projects that can reduce an allied European country's reliance 
        on natural gas, petroleum, or nuclear fuel produced in Russia; 
        and
            (4) providing technical assistance to an allied European 
        country, as the Secretary of Energy determines necessary to 
        reduce the allied European country's reliance on natural gas, 
        petroleum, or nuclear fuel produced in Russia.
    (b) Partnerships.--The Secretary of Energy may partner with other 
Federal agencies to carry out the program established under subsection

                    (B) such activity relies on resources, materials,

        whether income from sources without a possession specified in 
        subsection (a)(1) is effectively connected with the conduct of 
        a trade or business within such possession, and
            ``(4) for purposes of paragraph (2), income from activities 
        within the United States which are of a preparatory or 
        auxiliary character shall not be treated as income from sources 
        within the United States or as effectively connected with the 
        conduct of a trade or business within the United States.''.
    (c) Source Rules for Personal Property Sales.--Section 865(j)(3) of 
such Code is amended by inserting ``, 932,'' after ``931''.

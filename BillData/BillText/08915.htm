    Section 236A(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1226A(a)) is amended--
            (1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting the following:
            ``(2) Release.--Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and 
        (6), the Secretary of Homeland Security shall maintain custody 
        of such an alien until the alien is removed from the United 
        States. Except as provided in paragraph (6), such custody shall 
        be maintained irrespective of any relief from removal for which 
        the alien may be eligible, or any relief from removal granted 
        the alien, until the Secretary of Homeland Security determines 
        that the alien is no longer an alien who may be certified under 
        paragraph (3).'';
            (2) by striking paragraph (5) and inserting the following:
            ``(5) Commencement of proceedings.--The Secretary of 
        Homeland Security shall place an alien detained under paragraph 
        (1) in removal proceedings, or shall charge the alien with a 
        criminal offense, not later than 30 days after the commencement 
        of such detention. If the requirement of the preceding sentence 
        is not satisfied, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
        release the alien.'';
            (3) by striking paragraph (6) and inserting the following 
        new paragraph:
            ``(6) Limitation on indefinite detention.--An alien 
        detained solely under paragraph (1) who has not been removed 
        under section 1231(a)(1)(A) of this title, and whose removal is 
        unlikely in the reasonably foreseeable future for reasons other 
        than the alien's home country's refusal to issue appropriate 
        travel documents for the alien or otherwise accept return of 
        the alien, may be detained for additional periods of up to two 
        years.''; and
            (4) in subsection (b)(2)(A)--
                    (A) in clause (ii), by striking the semicolon and

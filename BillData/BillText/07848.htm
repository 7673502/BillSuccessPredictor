SEC. 3. WITHDRAWAL OF FEDERAL LAND.

    (a) Resource Assessments Required.--Subject to valid, existing 
rights, Federal lands and interests in lands may not be withdrawn from 
entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws, location, 
entry or patent under the mining laws, or operation of the mineral 
leasing, mineral materials, or geothermal leasing laws unless--
            (1) a quantitative and qualitative geophysical and 
        geological mineral resource assessment of the Federal lands and 
        interests in lands proposed to be withdrawn has been--
                    (A) completed by the Director of the United States 
                Geological Survey during the 10-year period ending 
                immediately before the date of the withdrawal; or
                    (B) certified as current by the Director of the

        Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary 
        of Energy, and the Secretary of State, have conducted a 
        quantitative and qualitative geophysical and geological 
        resource assessment to determine that the withdrawal is not 
        projected to have a negative impact on domestic energy 
        independence.
    (b) Requirement for Oil and Gas Leasing Withdrawal.--
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the 
Interior may not withdraw Federal land or interests in land from oil 
and gas leasing unless specifically authorized by a Federal statute 
if--
            (1) the proposed withdrawal is projected to reduce the 
        ability of the United States to meet domestic energy needs with 
        domestic energy production as determined by the resource 
        assessments made pursuant to this section; or
            (2) a parcel included in the proposed withdrawal has an 
        exterior boundary that is less than 50 miles from the exterior 
        boundary of another parcel that was withdrawn from oil and gas 
        leasing during the 1-year period before the date of the 
        proposed withdrawal.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to improve the 
 assessment process for financial institutions under that Act, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Making Communities Stronger through 
the Community Reinvestment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDING.

    The Congress finds that Senator William Proxmire, who authored the 
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 legislation, testified when 
discussing its purpose: ``By redlining . . . I am talking about the 
fact that banks and savings and loans will take their deposits from a 
community and instead of reinvesting them in that community, they will 
actually or figuratively draw a red line on a map around the areas of 
their city, sometimes in the inner city, sometimes in the older 
neighborhoods, sometimes ethnic and sometimes black, but often 
encompassing a great area of their neighborhood.''.

SEC. 3. ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICE.

    (a) In General.--Section 804 of the Community Reinvestment Act of 
1977 (12 U.S.C. 2903) is amended by adding at the end the following:

        supervisory agency may not give any credit for such service or 
        work unless--

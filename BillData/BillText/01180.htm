To amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to clarify when 
the time period for the issuance of citations under such Act begins and 
   to require a rule to clarify that an employer's duty to make and 
maintain accurate records of work-related injuries and illnesses is an 
                          ongoing obligation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Accurate Workplace Injury and 
Illness Records Restoration Act''.

SEC. 2. PERIOD FOR ISSUANCE OF A CITATION.

    Section 9(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 
U.S.C. 658(c)) is amended by adding at the end the following: ``For 
purposes of this subsection, a violation continues to occur for as long 
as an employer has not satisfied the requirements, rules, standards, 
orders, and regulations referenced in subsection (a).''.

SEC. 3. RULEMAKING.

    (a) Rule Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration shall issue a final rule amending its recordkeeping 
regulations under section 8(c) of the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act to clarify that--
            (1) the duty to make and maintain accurate records of work-
        related injuries and illnesses is an ongoing obligation;
            (2) the duty to make and maintain such records continues 
        for as long as the employer is required to keep records of the 
        recordable injury or illness; and
            (3) such duty does not expire solely because the employer 
        fails to create the necessary records when first required to do 
        so.
    (b) Authorization.--Subsection (a) shall be considered a specific 
authorization by Congress in accordance with section 801(b)(2) of title

SEC. 2. INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') 
        shall establish and operate an interactive, internet website-
        based dashboard (referred to in this section as the 
        ``dashboard'') that publicizes federally funded mental health 
        related grants, for the purpose of enabling potential 
        applicants for such grants, including applicants who would be 
        eligible for a subgrant under such a program, to review such 
        grants.
            (2) Design.--The public-facing, internet website-based 
        dashboard shall be designed in a user-friendly, publicly 
        accessible manner that complies with the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), and helps 
        entities identify mental health related grants for which 
        applicants may be eligible, to facilitate funding opportunity 
        communication and engagement.
            (3) Consultation.--In establishing the dashboard under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with--
                    (A) the Director of the National Institutes of 
                Health, the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and

following requirements:
            (1) Provide the following information:
                    (A) The name of each Federal grant program and, if 
                different, the name of each associated State grant 
                program, as available, that is designated for the 
                purposes of mental health support, treatment, or 
                assistance, or under which mental health support is an 
                acceptable expenditure of grant funds.
                    (B) With respect to the current fiscal year, for 
                each program for which subgrants are not available, 
                indicate whether applications for the Federal grant 
                application period is open or closed, and the opening 
                and closing dates.
                    (C) For each program for which amounts have been 
                awarded to States for the current fiscal year with 
                respect to a block grant described in subsection 
                (d)(2), include whether the relevant application period 
                for a subgrant remains open at the State level, and 
                whether there will be a new subgrant competition during 
                the current fiscal year, if such information is 
                available from the applicable State.
            (2) For purposes of assisting users in identifying programs 
        included in the dashboard, including the following information 
        with respect to each program listed:
                    (A) Any associated authorization, report, 
                appropriation, agency program, grant number, or other 
                information useful in identifying the program.
                    (B) Any subgrant name used by a State with respect 
                to a Federal grant program known by the Secretary.
            (3) Allow potential grant applicants to search the 
        dashboard by key categories and location, if applicable, for 
        which grants are available.
            (4) Provide, as appropriate, access or links to the

            (2) Block grants.--In the case of mental health resources 
        made available through Federal block grants to States, or 
        Federal funding for which a specific recipient is not 
        identified prior to its distribution to a State, the Secretary 
        shall establish a method for States to voluntarily identify 
        where Federal grants were distributed for the purpose of 
        enabling prospective applicants to recognize the program name 
        for the funding that is used at the State level and any 
        relevant direct website link to apply for the funding at the 
        State level.

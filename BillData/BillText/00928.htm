    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

        threshold amount. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the

                        individual filing a separate return.
                    ``(B) Marital status.--For purposes of this

                taxable year,

            ``(2) Reference taxable year.--Except as provided in 
        paragraph (3)(A), the term `reference taxable year' means, with 
        respect to any taxpayer for any calendar year, the taxpayer's 
        taxable year beginning in the preceding calendar year or, in 
        the case of taxpayer who did not file a return of tax for such 
        taxable year, the taxpayer's taxable year beginning in the 
        second preceding calendar year.
            ``(3) Modifications during calendar year.--The Secretary 
        may modify, during any calendar year, the annual advance amount 
        with respect to any taxpayer for such calendar year to take 
        into account--
                    ``(A) a return of tax filed by such taxpayer during 
                such calendar year (and the taxable year to which such 
                return relates may be taken into account as the 
                reference taxable year), and
                    ``(B) any other information provided by the 
                taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the Secretary to 
                determine payments under subsection (a) which, in the 
                aggregate during any taxable year of the taxpayer, more 
                closely total the Secretary's best estimate of the 
                credit allowed to the taxpayer under section 36C(a) 
                (determined without regard to subsection (i) thereof) 
                for such taxable year.
    ``(c) On-Line Information Portal.--The Secretary shall establish an 
on-line portal which allows taxpayers to--
            ``(1) elect not to receive payments under this section,
            ``(2) provide information to the Secretary which would be 
        relevant to a modification under subsection (b)(3)(B) of the 
        annual advance amount, including information regarding--

                qualifying children, including by reason of the birth

6103(b)(6)), the aggregate amount of such payments made to such 
taxpayer during such calendar year, and such other information as the 
Secretary determines appropriate.

SEC. 3. PAYMENTS TO POSSESSIONS.

    (a) Mirror Code Possession.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
pay to each possession of the United States with a mirror code tax 
system amounts equal to the loss to that possession by reason of the 
application of section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as 
added by section 2) with respect to taxable years beginning after 2020. 
Such amounts shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based 
on information provided by the government of the respective possession.
    (b) Other Possessions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to 
each possession of the United States which does not have a mirror code 
tax system amounts estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury as being 
equal to the aggregate benefits that would have been provided to 
residents of such possession by reason of the application of section 
36C of such Code (as so added) for taxable years beginning after 2020 
if a mirror code tax system had been in effect in such possession. The 
preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to any possession of 
the United States unless such possession has a plan, which has been 
approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, under which such possession 
will promptly distribute such payments to the residents of such 
possession.
    (c) Coordination With Credit Allowed Against United States Income 
Taxes.--No credit shall be allowed against United States income taxes 
for any taxable year under section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 (as so added) to any person--
            (1) to whom a credit is allowed against taxes imposed by 
        the possession by reason of the amendments made by this section 
        for such taxable year; or
            (2) who is eligible for a payment under a plan described in 
        subsection (b) with respect to such taxable year.

        Northern Mariana Islands.
            (2) Mirror code tax system.--For purposes of this section, 
        the term ``mirror code tax system'' means, with respect to any 
        possession of the United States, the income tax system of such 
        possession if the income tax liability of the residents of such 
        possession under such system is determined by reference to the 
        income tax laws of the United States as if such possession were 
        the United States.
            (3) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 
        1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, the payments under 
        this section shall be treated in the same manner as a refund

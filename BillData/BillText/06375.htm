_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To permit COPS grants to be used for the purpose of increasing the 
  compensation and hiring of law enforcement officers, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``COPS on the Beat Grant Program 
Reauthorization and Parity Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing 
        highlighted the importance of hiring law enforcement officers 
        who reflect the diversity and values of the community, and who 
        have both the mindset and the skills needed to engage with the 
        community.
            (2) Diverse workforces can be more effective, creative, and 
        resilient than homogenous workforces, and teams with broader 
        perspectives result in better decision-making and problem-
        solving practices. Recruiting a diverse pool of candidates 
        includes qualified individuals from different races, genders, 
        ethnicities, and cultural backgrounds.
            (3) Effective law enforcement recruitment practices can 
        help engender trust, develop good relations with their 
        communities, and ensure that the officers they hire can best 
        serve those communities. Recruitment efforts should start in 
        the community, and law enforcement agencies should consider 
        developing youth programs to attract younger generations. This 
        could include Explorer programs, internships through local 
        schools, cadet academies, university partnerships, and youth 
        mentorship programs that foster relationships between young 
        adults and departments. Not only do these programs develop 
        enthusiasm for a law enforcement career, they can also build 
        relationships between law enforcement agencies and the 
        communities they serve.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the COPS 
Office is uniquely suited to empower local law enforcement agencies to 
fulfill recommendations related to law enforcement hiring practices, 
including agencies being reflective of the communities they serve, both 
demographically and in values and vision, and possessing the mindset 
and skills needed to engage with the community.

SEC. 3. REAUTHORIZATION OF COPS ON THE BEAT GRANT PROGRAMS.

    (a) Reauthorization of COPS on the Beat Grant Program.--Section

        support, as provided in an approved plan pursuant to section 
        1702(c)(8).

        unaccounted for since World War II.
            (2) The POW/MIA Memorial and Museum is a unique and

        providing a venue for families of these men and women to tell 
        their stories.
            (3) The POW/MIA Memorial and Museum will publicize the 
        stories of such individuals, showcase the history of the POW/
        MIA logo, the history of the Naval Air Station Cecil Field as a 
        master jet base, and will serve as a reflective facility for

            (4) The POW/MIA Memorial and Museum will attract and 
        educate a diverse group of people through visitor-centered,

Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(n) Accelerated Depreciation for Nonresidential Real Property 
Acquired in Connection With the Relocation of Manufacturing to the 
United States.--
            ``(1) Treatment as 20-year property.--For purposes of this 
        section, qualified nonresidential real property shall be 
        treated as 20-year property.

        property, see subsection (k).
            ``(3) Qualified nonresidential real property.--For purposes 
        of this subsection, the term `qualified nonresidential real 
        property' means nonresidential real property placed in service 
        in the United States by a qualified manufacturer if such 
        property is acquired by such qualified manufacturer in 
        connection with a qualified relocation of manufacturing.
            ``(4) Qualified manufacturer.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `qualified manufacturer' means any person 
        engaged in the trade or business of manufacturing any tangible 
        personal property.
            ``(5) Qualified relocation of manufacturing.--For purposes 
        of this subsection--
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified relocation 
                of manufacturing' means, with respect to any qualified 
                manufacturer, the relocation of the manufacturing of 
                any tangible personal property from a foreign country 
                to the United States.
                    ``(B) Relocation of property not required.--For 
                purposes of subparagraph (A), manufacturing shall not 
                fail to be treated as relocated merely because property 
                used in such manufacturing was not relocated.
                    ``(C) Relocation of not less than equivalent 
                productive capacity required.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), manufacturing shall not be treated as 
                relocated unless the property manufactured in the 
                United States is substantially identical to the 
                property previously manufactured in a foreign country 
                and the increase in the units of production of such 
                property in the United States by the qualified 
                manufacturer is not less than the reduction in the 
                units of production of such property in such foreign 
                country by such qualified manufacturer.
            ``(6) Application to possessions of the united states.--For 
        purposes of this subsection, the term `United States' includes

        such Code is amended by inserting after section 139H the 
        following new section:

              WITH QUALIFIED RELOCATION OF MANUFACTURING.

income shall not include gain from the sale or exchange of qualified 
relocation disposition property.

        or business of manufacturing any tangible personal property in 
        the foreign country from which such manufacturing is being 
        relocated.
    ``(c) Other Terms.--Terms used in this section which are also used 
in subsection (n) of section 168 shall have the same meaning when used 
in this section as when used in such subsection.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections for part III 
        of subchapter B of chapter 1 of such Code is amended by 
        inserting after the item relating to section 139H the following 
        new item:

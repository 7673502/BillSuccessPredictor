    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. AVOIDING ABERRATIONAL RESULTS IN REQUIREMENTS FOR 
              ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

    The Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise section 210.1-
02(w)(1)(i)(A) of title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, to permit a 
registrant, in determining the significance of an acquisition or 
disposition described in such section 210.1-02(w)(1)(i)(A), to 
calculate the registrant's aggregate worldwide market value based on 
the applicable trading value, conversion value, or exchange value of 
all of the registrant's outstanding classes of stock (including 
preferred stock and non-traded common shares that are convertible into 
or exchangeable for traded common shares) and not just the voting and 
non-voting common equity of the registrant.

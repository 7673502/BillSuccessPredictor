                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide incentives for 
      the use of automatic portability arrangements under defined 
              contribution plans, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Auto-Portability Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Up to $105,000,000,000 of retirement savings leaves the 
        defined contribution pension plan system annually because 
        employees cash out their savings after a job change.
            (2) Federal law should encourage the private sector to 
        reduce such cash-outs by developing automated solutions to 
        improve defined contribution plan portability.

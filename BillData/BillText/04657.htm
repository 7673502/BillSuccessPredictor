of electricity, natural gas, oil, and any other fuel regularly used to 
supply energy to the home.
    ``(B) An energy efficiency report described in this subparagraph,

        veteran provided to the Secretary an energy efficiency report, 
        including the number of such loans for which cost savings were 
        taken into account pursuant to paragraph (1); and
            ``(B) of the number of loans enumerated under subparagraph 
        (A), an enumeration of the default rates and rates of

                    ``(B) Family choice.--Subparagraph (A) may not be

                internet service may be included in a utility allowance 
                for a household only if the internet service provider, 
                upon initial provision of such service for a household, 
                provides the household with a specific technology 
                capable of blocking or filtering internet access to 
                visual depictions described in section 254(h)(5)(B)(i) 
                of the Communications Act of 1937 (47 U.S.C. 
                254(h)(5)(B)(i)) that provides a level of protection 
                against access by minors to such depictions through the 
                internet that is at least as great as the level of 
                protection provided by a technology protection measure 
                (as such term is defined in paragraph (7) of such 
                section 254(h)) that meets the requirements for 
                certification under such paragraph, as determined by 
                the Secretary.''.

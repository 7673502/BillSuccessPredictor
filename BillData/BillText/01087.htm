                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require reporting of 
 certain expenditures for political activities, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Shareholder Political Transparency 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) corporations make significant political contributions 
        and expenditures that directly or indirectly influence the 
        election of candidates and support or oppose political causes;
            (2) decisions to use corporate funds for political 
        contributions and expenditures are usually made by corporate 
        boards and executives, rather than shareholders;
            (3) corporations, acting through boards and executives, are 
        obligated to conduct business for the best interests of their 
        owners, the shareholders;
            (4) historically, shareholders have not had a way to know, 
        or to influence, the political activities of corporations they 
        own;
            (5) shareholders and the public have a right to know how 
        corporate managers are spending company funds to make political 
        contributions and expenditures benefitting candidates, 
        political parties, and political causes; and
            (6) corporations should be accountable to shareholders in 
        making political contributions or expenditures affecting 
        Federal governance and public policy.

SEC. 3. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

    Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(s) Reporting Requirements Relating to Certain Political

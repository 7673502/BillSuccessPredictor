                                 A BILL


 
To require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to 
 carry out certain activities to protect communities from the harmful 
              effects of plastics, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Communities from Plastics 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) plastics production is exacerbating the climate crisis 
        and driving environmental injustice in vulnerable communities 
        located near petrochemical facilities;
            (2) plastics production is on track to double in the decade 
        following the date of enactment of this Act, locking in harmful 
        emissions for decades;
            (3) plastics and other petrochemicals are forecasted to 
        become the largest driver of oil and hydraulically fractured 
        gas demand by 2050;
            (4) some studies have projected that the plastics industry 
        will emit more greenhouse gas emissions than coal plants in the 
        United States by 2030;
            (5) petrochemical facilities that produce plastics are more 
        likely to be located in low-income communities and communities 
        of color, disproportionately exposing those communities to 
        harmful pollutants;
            (6) plastics production and certain disposal facilities 
        pollute surrounding communities with chemicals that are known 
        to cause cancer, birth defects, and other serious illnesses;
            (7) transitioning off fossil fuels for power generation and 
        transportation only to replace that demand with more fossil 
        fuel-based plastics production is not a viable strategy and 
        fails to protect communities;
            (8) plastics carry impacts throughout their lifecycles, 
        including the impacts of--
                    (A) oil and gas extraction;
                    (B) plastics refining, manufacturing, and certain 
                methods of disposal; and
                    (C) plastics pollution that ends up in communities 
                and in the environment, where the degrading plastics 
                leach chemical additives and emit greenhouse gases;
            (9) addressing the plastics crisis requires a shift away 
        from single-use plastics in nonessential settings; and
            (10) technologies that convert plastics to fuel, use 
        plastics for energy generation, generate feedstocks for the 
        chemical industry, or produce hazardous waste and toxic air 
        pollution are not a sustainable solution to the plastics 
        crisis.

    (b) Federal Source Reduction Targets.--
            (1) Baseline.--Not later than December 31, 2025, the

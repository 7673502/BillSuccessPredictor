To encourage the extraction and processing of rare earth metals in the 
                 United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring Essential Energy and 
Security Holdings Onshore for Rare Earths Act of 2022'' or the 
``REEShore Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
                on Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and the

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF STRATEGIC RARE EARTH METAL AND RARE EARTH 
              METAL PRODUCTS RESERVE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the storage of substantial 
quantities of rare earth metals and rare earth metal products will--
            (1) diminish the vulnerability of the United States to the 
        effects of a severe supply chain interruption; and
            (2) provide limited protection from the short-term 
        consequences of an interruption in supplies of rare earth metal 
        products, particularly such products required for defense 
        manufacturing and use.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
provide for the establishment of a strategic rare earth metals and rare 
earth metal products reserve.
    (c) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior and 
        the Secretary of Defense shall jointly submit the appropriate 
        congressional committees a report describing--
                    (A) the strategic requirements of the United States 
                regarding stockpiles of rare earth metals and processed 
                and refined rare earth metal products; and
                    (B) the requirements for such metals and products 
                to support the United States for one year in the event 
                of a supply disruption.
            (2) Considerations.--In developing the report required by 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary 
        of Defense shall take into consideration the needs of the Armed 
        Forces of the United States, the defense industrial and 
        technology sectors, and any places, organizations, physical 
        infrastructure, or digital infrastructure designated as 
        critical to the national security of the United States.
    (d) Implementation.--Not later than 3 years after submission of the 
report required by subsection (c), the Secretary of the Interior shall 
take such actions as are necessary to procure all types of rare earth 
metals and processed and refined rare earth metal products in 
appropriate quantities to support the strategic requirements described 
in the report.
    (e) Reassessment of Requirements.--The Secretary of the Interior 
and the Secretary of Defense shall--
            (1) jointly reassess the strategic requirements described 
        in paragraph (1) of subsection (c) and the considerations 
        described in paragraph (2) of that subsection; and
            (2) not less frequently than annually, submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report on--
                    (A) that reassessment; and
                    (B) describing any activities relating to the 
                establishment or use of a strategic rare earth metals 
                and rare earth metal products reserve during the 
                preceding year.

SEC. 4. DISCLOSURES CONCERNING RARE EARTH METALS BY CONTRACTORS OF 
              DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.

    (a) Requirement.--The Secretary of Defense shall require that any 
contractor that provides to the Department of Defense a system with a 
rare earth metal permanent magnet disclose, along with delivery of the

identification of the country or countries in which--
            (1) the rare earth metals used in the magnet were mined;
            (2) the rare earth metals were refined into oxides;
            (3) the rare earth metals were made into metals and alloys; 
        and
            (4) the magnet was sintered or bonded and magnetized.
    (c) Implementation of Supply Chain Tracking System.--If a 
contractor cannot make the disclosure required by subsection (a) with 
respect to a magnet, the Secretary shall require the contractor to 
establish and implement a supply chain tracking system in order to make

            (2) an assessment of the extent of reliance by the United 
        States on foreign countries, and especially countries that are 
        not allies of the United States, for rare earth metals;
            (3) a determination with respect to which systems are of 
        the greatest concern for interruptions of rare earth metal 
        supply chains; and

 To award a Congressional gold medal, collectively, to the First Rhode 
 Island Regiment, in recognition of their dedicated service during the 
                           Revolutionary War.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``First Rhode Island Regiment 
Congressional Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) During the winter at Valley Forge, from 1777-1778, the 
        Continental Army had difficulty recruiting the necessary quotas 
        of men set by the Congress.
            (2) At the same time, the State of Rhode Island was ordered 
        to supply two battalions while faced with the occupation of the 
        City of Newport by the British.
            (3) In January 1778, at the urging of Brigadier General 
        James Varnum, General George Washington wrote to Governor 
        Nicholas Cooke of the State of Rhode Island requesting 
        assistance recruiting men for the Continental Line.
            (4) On February 14, 1778, the Rhode Island General Assembly 
        voted to allow the enlistment of ``every able-bodied negro, 
        mulatto, or Indian man slave''.
            (5) In addition, the Rhode Island General Assembly provided 
        that any enlisted slave ``upon his passing muster before 
        Colonel Christopher Greene, be immediately discharged from the 
        service of his master or mistress, and be absolutely free as 
        though he had never been incumbered and be incumbered with any 
        kind of servitude or slavery.''.
            (6) As a result, between February 1778 and June 1778, 
        Colonel Christopher Greene, Lt. Colonel Jeremiah Olney and 
        Major Samuel Ward recruited almost 200 men of African heritage 
        and Indigenous descent who formed the core of the First Rhode 
        Island Regiment.
            (7) The First Rhode Island Regiment became among the first 
        units in American History in which men of every race and 
        ethnicity were recruited to serve.
            (8) On August 28, 1778, at the Battle of Rhode Island, 
        following an attempted siege of British-occupied Newport along 
        with the newly allied French fleet, the First Rhode Island 
        Regiment acted heroically in holding back Hessian forces and 
        causing them to retreat.
            (9) During the Battle of Rhode Island, the First Rhode 
        Island Regiment's losses included three killed, nine wounded 
        and eleven missing soldiers.
            (10) For an additional 5 years, the First Rhode Island 
        Regiment fought bravely to win American independence including 
        at Fort Oswego, Saratoga, and Yorktown.
            (11) On June 13, 1783, at Saratoga, the First Rhode Island 
        Regiment was demobilized.
            (12) Their commander, Colonel Jeremiah Olney, praised the 
        Regiment for ``faithfully preserving in the best of causes, in 
        every stage of service, with unexampled fortitude and patience 
        through all the danger and toils of a long and severe war''.
            (13) Afterwards, some veterans of the First Rhode Island 
        Regiment had to consistently resist efforts at re-enslavement 
        and fought for back wages from the Rhode Island General 
        Assembly.
            (14) According to the Rhode Island State Archives, the 
        First Rhode Island Regiment included at least the following 
        soldiers: Babcock, Priamus (Primus); Bent, Prince; Bours, Cato; 
        Brown, Priamus (Primus); Burk, Africa; Burroughs, John;

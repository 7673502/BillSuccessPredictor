                                 AN ACT


 
 To assist Tribal governments in the management of buffalo and buffalo 
       habitat and the reestablishment of buffalo on Indian land.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Buffalo Management Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) buffalo sustained a majority of Indian Tribes in North 
        America for many centuries before buffalo were nearly 
        exterminated by non-Indian hunters in the mid-1800s;
            (2) the historical, cultural, and spiritual connection 
        between buffalo and Indian Tribes has not diminished over time;
            (3) Indian Tribes have long desired the reestablishment of 
        buffalo throughout Indian country for cultural, spiritual, and 
        subsistence purposes; and
            (4) the successful restoration of buffalo would allow an 
        Indian Tribe to benefit from--
                    (A) the reintroduction of buffalo into the diets of 
                the members of the Indian Tribe;
                    (B) the rekindling of the spiritual and cultural 
                relationship between buffalo and the Indian Tribe; and
                    (C) the use of buffalo for economic development, in 
                the case of an Indian Tribe that chooses to use buffalo 
                for economic development.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to fulfill the government-to-government relationship 
        between Tribal governments and the United States in the 
        management of buffalo and buffalo habitat;
            (2) to promote and develop the capacity of Indian Tribes 
        and Tribal organizations to manage buffalo and buffalo habitat;
            (3) to protect, conserve, and enhance buffalo, which are 
        important to the subsistence, culture, and economic development 
        of many Indian Tribes;
            (4) to promote the development and use of buffalo and 
        buffalo habitat for the maximum practicable benefit of Indian 
        Tribes and Tribal organizations, through management of buffalo 
        and buffalo habitats in accordance with integrated resource 
        management plans developed by Indian Tribes and Tribal 
        organizations;
            (5) to develop buffalo herds and increase production of 
        buffalo in order to meet Tribal subsistence, health, cultural, 
        and economic development needs; and
            (6) to promote the inclusion of Indian Tribes and Tribal 
        organizations in Department of the Interior, local, regional, 
        national, or international--
                    (A) decision-making processes; and

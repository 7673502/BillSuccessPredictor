                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint a commemorative coin 
                in recognition of James Weldon Johnson.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``James Weldon Johnson Commemorative 
Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) James Weldon Johnson was born on June 17, 1871, in 
        Jacksonville, Florida, to a Bahamian mother, Helen Louise 
        Dillet, and African-American father, James Johnson. He had a 
        younger brother, John Rosamund Johnson. His mother had a large 
        influence on his interest in literature and music.
            (2) At the age of 16, James Weldon Johnson enrolled at 
        Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University, a 
        historically Black college, and graduated in 1894.
            (3) James Weldon Johnson returned to Jacksonville following 
        his graduation, where he served as principal of the Stanton 
        School. He expanded the school to include Florida's first high 
        school for African Americans, which opened in 1898.
            (4) In 1895, James Weldon Johnson started the Daily 
        American, Florida's first African-American newspaper.
            (5) During this period, James Weldon Johnson was admitted 
        to the Florida Bar in 1897. He became the first African 
        American to pass the Florida Bar since the Reconstruction Era 
        ended.
            (6) In 1899, James Weldon Johnson wrote the poem ``Lift 
        Every Voice and Sing'' to honor Abraham Lincoln's birthday. His 
        brother, John Rosamund Johnson, composed the music to turn it 
        into a song. In 1919, the National Advancement of Colored 
        People (NAACP) designated the song as the ``Negro National 
        Anthem''.
            (7) As part of the Great Migration, James Weldon Johnson 
        and John Rosamund Johnson moved to Harlem, New York. They 
        became composers for Broadway shows and later became integral 
        figures of the Harlem Renaissance.
            (8) After winning the election, in 1906, President Theodore 
        Roosevelt appointed James Weldon Johnson as U.S. Consul in 
        Venezuela. In 1909, he was appointed as U.S. Consul in 
        Nicaragua by President William Taft.
            (9) Following his diplomatic service, James Weldon Johnson 
        became a field secretary for the NAACP in 1916. In 1920, he 
        became the first African-American Executive Secretary for the 
        NAACP, where he helped increase membership, create new 
        chapters, and organize Civil Rights movements across the 
        country.
            (10) James Weldon Johnson represented the NAACP as the 
        chief Congressional lobbyist to encourage passage of the 
        Representative Leonidas Dyer anti-lynching bill. This bill went 
        on to pass the U.S. House of Representatives in 1922 but failed 
        in the U.S. Senate due to the filibuster.
            (11) In 1930, after serving 10 years in the NAACP, James 
        Weldon Johnson accepted an offer to become the Spence Chair of 
        Creative Literature and Writing at Fisk University, a 
        historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee.
            (12) In 1934, James Weldon Johnson was hired as the first 
        Black professor at New York University, where he taught 
        Creative Literature and Education.
            (13) James Weldon Johnson was an accomplished novelist and 
        poet. He released several poetry collections and novels, among 
        his most popular pieces of literature were God's Trombones: 
        Seven Negro Sermons in Verse and The Autobiography of an Ex-
        Colored Man.
            (14) James Weldon Johnson passed away suddenly in 1938. His 
        funeral was held in Harlem, New York, where over 2,000 people 
        attended.
            (15) James Weldon Johnson's excellence revolutionized 
        literature, music, education, politics, and law. His 
        fearlessness to fight for equality created pathways for African 
        Americans to proudly pursue their aspirations.

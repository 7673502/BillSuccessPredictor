    ``(c) Calculation of Amounts.--
            ``(1) State share.--For fiscal year 2022 and each fiscal 
        year thereafter, the amount for each State of combined 
        apportionments for the national highway performance program

                    ``(A) Initial amount.--The initial amount for each 
                State shall be determined by multiplying the total 
                amount available for apportionment by the share for 
                each State, which shall be equal to the proportion 
                that--
                            ``(i) the amount of apportionments that the 
                        State received for fiscal year 2012; bears to

                            ``(i) In general.--The initial amounts 
                        resulting from the calculation under 
                        subparagraph (A) shall be adjusted to ensure 
                        that, for each State, the amount of combined 
                        apportionments for the programs shall not be 
                        less than an amount equal to--

                        of this subparagraph, the applicable percentage 
                        shall be an amount, expressed as a percentage,

                                divided by

        year described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall apportion 
        the sum authorized to be appropriated for expenditure on the

                                 A BILL


 
 To establish an alternative fuel and low-emission aviation technology 
                    program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Aviation Emissions Reduction 
Opportunity Act'' or the ``AERO Act''.

SEC. 2. ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND LOW-EMISSION AVIATION TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary of Transportation, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of 
Energy, and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, 
shall establish a competitive grant program to provide grants to 
eligible entities to carry out projects located in the United States 
that produce, transport, blend, or store sustainable aviation fuel, or 
develop, demonstrate, or apply low-emission aviation technologies.
    (b) Considerations.--In carrying out subsection (a), the Secretary 
shall consider, with respect to a proposed project--
            (1) the capacity for the eligible entity to increase the 
        domestic production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel 
        or the use of low-emission aviation technologies among the 
        United States commercial aviation and aerospace industry;
            (2) the projected greenhouse gas emissions from such 
        project, including emissions resulting from the development of 
        the project, and the potential the project has to reduce or 
        displace, on a lifecycle basis, United States greenhouse gas 
        emissions associated with air travel;
            (3) the capacity to create new jobs and develop supply 
        chain partnerships in the United States;
            (4) for projects related to the production of sustainable 
        aviation fuel, the projected lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 
        benefits from the proposed project, which shall include 
        feedstock and fuel production and potential direct and indirect 
        greenhouse gas emissions (including resulting from changes in 
        land use); and
            (5) the benefits of ensuring a diversity of feedstocks for 
        sustainable aviation fuel, including the use of waste carbon 
        oxides and direct air capture.
    (c) Fuel Emissions Reduction Test.--For purposes of clause (ii) of 
subsection (f)(7)(E), the Secretary shall, not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this section, adopt at least 1 methodology for 
testing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions that meets the requirements 
of such clause.
    (d) Funding.--
            (1) Authorization of appropriations.--Out of any money in 
        the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there are authorized 
        to be appropriated for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027, 
        $200,000,000 to carry out the purposes of this section, to 
        remain available until expended.
            (2) Funding distribution.--Subject to paragraph (4), of any 
        amount made available under paragraph (1)--
                    (A) 30 percent of such amount shall be awarded for 
                projects that develop, demonstrate, or apply low-
                emission aviation technologies; and
                    (B) 70 percent of such amount shall be awarded for 
                projects that produce, transport, blend, or store 
                sustainable aviation fuel.
            (3) Federal share.--The Federal share of the cost of a 
        project carried out using a grant provided under this section 
        may not exceed 90 percent of the total cost of the project. The 
        Secretary shall consider the extent to which a proposed project 
        meets the considerations described in subsection (b) in 
        determining the Federal share under this paragraph.
            (4) Administration.--The Secretary may reserve not more 
        than 2 percent of the amount appropriated under paragraph (1) 
        for expenses related to administering this section.
    (e) Application of Law.--
            (1) Buy america.--None of the funds made available under 
        this section may be obligated for a project unless all of the 
        iron, steel, manufactured products, and construction materials 
        used in the project are produced in the United States, as such 
        term is defined in section 70912 of the Infrastructure 
        Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58).
            (2) Waiver.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply in any case or 
        category of cases in which the Secretary finds that--
                    (A) applying paragraph (1) would be inconsistent 
                with the public interest;
                    (B) types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or 
                construction materials are not produced in the United 
                States in sufficient and reasonably available 
                quantities or of a satisfactory quality, or
                    (C) the inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured 
                products, or construction materials produced in the 
                United States will increase the cost of the overall 
                project by more than 25 percent.
            (3) Written justification.--Before issuing a waiver under 
        paragraph (2), the Secretary shall--
                    (A) make publicly available in an easily accessible 
                location on a website designated by the Office of 
                Management and Budget and on the website of the Federal 
                agency a detailed written explanation for the proposed 
                determination to issue the waiver; and
                    (B) provide a period of not less than 15 days for 
                public comment on the proposed waiver.
            (4) Prevailing wages.--The Secretary shall take such action 
        as may be necessary to ensure that all laborers and mechanics 
        employed by contractors or subcontractors on a project assisted 
        in whole or in part by funding made available under this 
        section shall be paid wages at rates not less than those 
        prevailing for the same type of work on similar projects in the 
        locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor, in accordance 
        with sections 3141-3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40. The 
        Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the labor 
        standards specified in this subsection, the authority and 
        functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 
        (15 F.R. 3176; 64 Stat. 1267) and section 3145 of title 40.

                greenhouse gas emissions reduction in comparison with 
                petroleum-based jet fuel, as determined by a test that 
                shows--
                            (i) the fuel production pathway achieves at 
                        least a 50 percent reduction of the aggregate 
                        attributional core lifecycle emissions and the 
                        induced land use change values under a 
                        lifecycle methodology for sustainable aviation

                                 A BILL


 
    To provide for security in the Black Sea region, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Black Sea Security Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Black Sea region is of critical importance to the 
        national security of six nations: Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, 
        Romania, Bulgaria, and Turkey.
            (2) The Black Sea region has been a zone of increasing 
        tension and conflict on the eastern border of the European 
        Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        following President Vladimir Putin's 2014 and 2022 invasions of 
        Ukraine and 2008 invasion of Georgia, which still has 
        territories illegally occupied by the Russian Federation.
            (3) Since the illegal attempted annexation of Ukraine's 
        Crimea region in 2014, the Russian Federation has enhanced the 
        Black Sea Fleet to increase its presence in the region, 
        enhanced its air and coastal defenses, disregarded 
        international law regarding freedom of navigation to interrupt 
        in regular shipping routes, and threatened freedom of 
        navigation exercises in the Black Sea.
            (4) Since its military interventions in the Black Sea 
        region starting in 2008, the Russian Federation has undertaken 
        persistent hybrid measures to further destabilize the region 
        through malign influence campaigns.
            (5) Since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
        Federation, the unity among Black Sea countries has 
        strengthened, particularly among NATO member countries Romania, 
        Bulgaria, and Turkey.
            (6) The Russian Federation is leveraging its illegal claim 
        over Black Sea waters and the territories of Black Sea region 
        states to execute military exercises to threaten the 
        territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and kill innocent civilians.
            (7) Russia has a long history of using its position in the 
        Black Sea and Crimea to threaten NATO allies, including the HMS 
        Defender incident of June 2021, when a British ship was 
        harassed by Russian ships while undertaking a freedom of 
        navigation patrol in waters near the Crimean Peninsula.
            (8) While NATO has conducted routine exercises in the 
        region, the United States presence in the Black Sea has 
        decreased since Russia's annexation of Crimea due to competing 
        security priorities among allies, a lack of available ships and 
        resources, and a lack of a clearly defined regional strategy.
            (9) While, in February 2022, Turkey blocked the entry of 
        Russian warships into the Black Sea pursuant to the Convention 
        regarding the Regime of the Straits, signed at Montreux, 
        Switzerland July 20, 1936 (commonly known as the ``Montreux 
        Convention''), the Montreux Convention does not account for the 
        increase in size, weight, and capabilities of modern warships, 
        and Russia does not have the same limits on tonnage as non-
        littoral states.
            (10) Turkey has resisted attempts to change its 
        interpretation of the Montreux Convention to avoid weakening 
        their position in the region.
            (11) While NATO has long recognized the strategic 
        importance of the Black Sea, Russia has sought to capitalize on 
        at times divergent priorities among NATO members in the region 
        to advance expansionist claims.
            (12) On February 24, 2022, Russian Federation President 
        Vladimir Putin instigated an unprovoked, unjustified, and 
        unlawful war violating the territorial integrity of the 
        sovereign country of Ukraine and is using the Russian 
        Federation's military presence on the Black Sea to kill 
        innocent Ukrainian civilians.
            (13) The Russian Federation's unprovoked war on Ukraine has 
        underscored the importance of the Black Sea region to United 
        States national security interests.
            (14) The Russian Federation's unprovoked war has caused a 
        food security crisis as 20,000,000-30,000,000 tons of Ukrainian 
        grain remain unable to leave Ukraine in an efficient and secure 
        manner. The war has also impeded Ukraine's ability to produce 
        and transport next year's harvest.
            (15) The Russian Federation's actions in and around the 
        Black Sea have also disrupted secure, reliable access to energy 
        resources throughout Europe. Notably, Gazprom suspended natural 
        gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria on April 27, 2022, after 
        the two countries refused to abide by a March 31, 2022, Russian 
        decree that all payments be made in rubles, in violation of the 
        terms of their contracts with Gazprom.
            (16) The People's Republic of China (PRC)'s coercive 
        economic policies also threaten the economic stability of the 
        Black Sea region.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON BLACK SEA SECURITY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the interest of the United States to prevent 
        the spread of further armed conflict in Europe by recognizing 
        the Black Sea region as an arena of Russian aggression;
            (2) the littoral members of the Black Sea are critical in 
        countering aggression by the Government of the Russian 
        Federation and maintaining the collective security of the NATO 
        alliance;
            (3) the repeated, illegal, unprovoked, and violent attempts 
        of the Russian Federation to expand its territory and control 
        access to the Mediterranean through the Black Sea constitutes a 
        threat to the national security of the United States and the 
        NATO alliance;
            (4) the United States condemns attempts by the Russian 
        Federation to change or alter boundaries in the Black Sea 
        region by any means contrary to international law;
            (5) the United States and its allies should robustly 
        counter Russia's illegal territorial claims on the Crimean 
        Peninsula, along Ukraine's territorial waters in the Black Sea 
        and the Sea of Azov, in the Black Sea's international waters, 
        and in the territories it is illegally occupying in Ukraine;
            (6) the United States should continue to work within NATO 
        and with NATO allies to develop a long-term strategy to enhance 
        security, establish a permanent, sustainable presence in the 
        eastern flank, and bolster the democratic resilience of its 
        allies and partners in the region;
            (7) the United States should also work with the European 
        Union in coordinating a strategy to support democratic 
        initiatives and economic prosperity in the region, which 
        includes two European Union members and four aspirant nations;
            (8) the United States should explore efforts to rebuild 
        trust and bilateral relations with Turkey, a key ally in the 
        Black Sea region and a bulwark against Iran;
            (9) it is in the interest of the United States that NATO 
        adopt a robust strategy toward the Black Sea, including by 
        working with interested partner countries in the region to 
        advance common security objectives;
            (10) the United States should work to foster dialogue among 
        countries within the Black Sea region to improve communication 
        and intelligence sharing and increase cyber defense 
        capabilities;
            (11) countries with historic and economic ties to Russia 
        are looking to the United States and Europe to provide a 
        positive economic presence in the broader region as a 
        counterbalance to the Russian Federation's malign influence in 
        the region;
            (12) it is in the interest of the United States to support 
        and bolster the economic ties between the United States and 
        Black Sea partners;
            (13) the United States should support the initiative 
        undertaken by central and eastern European states to advance 
        the Three Seas Initiative Fund to strengthen transport, energy, 
        and digital infrastructure connectivity in the region between 
        the Adriatic Sea, Baltic Sea, and Black Sea;
            (14) there are mutually beneficial opportunities for 
        increased investment and economic expansion, particularly on 
        energy, climate, and transport infrastructure initiatives, 
        between the United States and Black Sea states and the broader 
        region;
            (15) improved economic ties between the United States and 
        the Black Sea states and the broader region can lead to a 
        strengthened strategic partnership;
            (16) the United States must address the food security 
        challenges arising from closure of Ukraine's Black Sea ports, 
        as this global challenge will have critical national security 
        implications for the United States, our partners, and allies;
            (17) Russia has a brutal history of using hunger as a 
        weapon and must be stopped; and
            (18) countering the PRC's coercive economic pursuits 
        remains an important policy imperative in order to further 
        integrate the Black Sea countries into western economies and 
        improve regional stability.

                    (D) Assessments on energy diversification. The 
                assessment should focus on the immediate need to 
                replace energy supplies from Russia, and recognize the 
                long-term importance of broader energy diversification, 
                including clean energy initiatives.
                    (E) Assessments of potential food security 
                solutions.
            (3) Democratic resilience.--The strategy established under

                                 A BILL

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Artificial Intelligence Job 
Opportunities and Background Summary Act of 2022'' or the ``AI JOBS Act

Pensions of the Senate, a report on artificial intelligence and its 
impact on the workforce, which shall include the following:
            (1) Outline the specific data, and the availability of such

        artificial intelligence.
            (2) Identification of industries that are projected to have 
        the most growth in artificial intelligence use, and whether the

        capabilities or their replacement.
            (3) Analysis of the expertise and education (including 
        computer science literacy) needed to develop, operate, or work 
        alongside artificial intelligence over the next two decades, as 
        compared to the levels of such expertise and education among 
        the workforce as of the date of enactment of this Act.
            (4) Analysis of which demographics (including ethnic, 
        gender, economic, age, and regional) may experience expanded 
        career opportunities, and which such demographics may be 
        vulnerable to career displacement, due to artificial 
        intelligence.
            (5) Any recommendations to alleviate workforce 
        displacement, prepare future workforce members for the 
        artificial-intelligence economy, and any other relevant 
        observations or recommendations within the field of artificial 
        intelligence.

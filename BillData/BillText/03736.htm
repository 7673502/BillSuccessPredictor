    To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to waive the fee for 
   installment agreements paid by electronic payment through a debit 
                              instrument.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Installation Agreement Affordability 
Act''.

SEC. 2. INSTALLMENT FEE WAIVED FOR CERTAIN ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS.

    (a) In General.--Section 6159(f)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 is amended to read as follows:
            ``(2) Waiver or reimbursement.--
                    ``(A) In the case of a taxpayer who has agreed to 
                make payments under the installment agreement by 
                electronic payment through a debit instrument, no fee 
                shall be imposed on an installment agreement under this 
                section.
                    ``(B) In the case of a taxpayer with an adjusted 
                gross income, as determined for the most recent year 
                for which such information is available, which does not 
                exceed 250 percent of the applicable poverty level (as 
                determined by the Secretary), if the taxpayer is unable 
                to make payments under the installment agreement by 
                electronic payment through a debit instrument, the 
                Secretary shall, upon completion of the installment 
                agreement, pay the taxpayer an amount equal to any such 
                fees imposed.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to installment agreements entered into after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.

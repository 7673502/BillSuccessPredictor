SEC. 4. DUTIES OF TASK FORCE.

    The Task Force shall determine and analyze the following:
            (1) The extent of efforts backed by the Russian Federation 
        or any agent or instrumentality of the Russian Federation to 
        financially support nongovernmental organizations in Western 
        countries that opposed nuclear energy and fracking.
            (2) The success or failure of these efforts to suppress 
        investment by Western countries in diverse energy portfolios.
            (3) The extent to which the funding of these organizations 
        has increased the reliance of Western countries on energy 
        exported from the Russian Federation.
            (4) The assessment of the level of interdependence of 
        Western countries with the Russian Federation, and the extent 
        to which Western countries are subject to coercion by the 
        Russian Federation, because Western countries lack a diverse 
        energy portfolio.
            (5) An assessment of the extent to which energy 
        independence could affect the American economy and provide 
        insulation for Western countries against Russian intimidation.
            (6) The extent to which the structure of energy agreements 
        between the Russian Federation and other energy companies used 
        the participation of smaller, more discreet third-party 
        companies to provide the Russian Federation with greater 
        control over the agreements, including an assessment of the 
        role of companies which were subsidiaries of Russian energy 
        companies or which were controlled overtly or covertly by the 
        Russian Federation or instruments of the Russian Federation.
            (7) An assessment of the Russian Federation's control of 
        and investment in energy companies of Western nations, 
        including companies involved in energy distribution, electric 
        power generation, storage of materials, pipeline maintenance, 
        and similar activities.

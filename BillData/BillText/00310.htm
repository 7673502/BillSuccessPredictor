  To posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to 
 Glen Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Stevens, and Sean Smith, in 
            recognition of their contributions to the Nation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On September 11, 2012, the United States consulate, and its 
    personnel in Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants.
        (2) Four Americans were killed in the attack, including 
    Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and 
    Tyrone Woods.
        (3) Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were former Navy SEALs who 
    served as security personnel in Libya. As the attack unfolded, they 
    bravely attempted to defend American property and protect United 
    States diplomatic personnel. In so doing, they selflessly 
    sacrificed their own lives.
        (4) Glen Doherty was a Navy SEAL for 12 years and served in 
    Iraq and Afghanistan. He attained the rank of Petty Officer First 
    Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal. 
    After leaving the Navy, Glen Doherty worked with the Department of 
    State to protect American diplomats.
        (5) Tyrone Woods served for 20 years as a Navy SEAL including 
    tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq he led multiple raids and 
    reconnaissance missions and earned the Bronze Star. After retiring 
    from the Navy as a Senior Chief Petty Officer, Tyrone Woods worked 
    with the Department of State to protect American diplomats.
        (6) J. Christopher Stevens served for 21 years in the U.S. 
    Foreign Service. He was serving as U.S. Ambassador to Libya and 
    previously served twice in the country, as both Special 
    Representative to the Libyan Transitional National Council and as 
    the Deputy Chief of Mission. Earlier in his life, he also served as 
    a Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco.
        (7) Sean Smith served for 6 years in the U.S. Air Force. He 
    attained the rank of Staff Sergeant and was awarded the Air Force 
    Commendation Medal. After leaving the Air Force, Sean Smith served 
    for 10 years in the State Department on various assignments, which 
    took him to places such as Baghdad, Brussels, Pretoria, and The 
    Hague.
        (8) As their careers attest, all four men served their country 
    honorably.

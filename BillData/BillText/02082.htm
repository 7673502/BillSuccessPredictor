                emergency, or natural disaster scenarios.
            (2) The quantities of the items described in paragraph (1) 
        that are available, as of the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, in inventories, emergency caches, or other emergency 
        inventories of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
            (3) The anticipated quantities of the items described in 
        paragraph (1) that would be necessary under potential epidemic,

        scenarios the Secretary determines to be relevant for planning 
        purposes.
            (4) The assumptions and key planning factors used by the

            (3) use existing contracts and agreements and enter into 
        new contracts and agreements, as necessary, with manufacturers

        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs

                        Veterans Affairs plans to ensure the Department 
                        continues to have access to adequate quantities 
                        of such items and types of items, including in 
                        the Warstopper Program and in regional, 
                        physical inventories; and
                            (ii) justifications for the method or 
                        methods identified under clause (i).
            (2) Updates to report.--The Secretary shall update the 
        report required under paragraph (1) on an annual basis for each 
        of the two years following the submission of the report under 
        paragraph (1) and submit such updates to the Committees on 
        Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives.
    (d) Prohibition on Exclusive Reliance on Regional Inventories.--The 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure that the Department does not 
exclusively rely on holding regional, physical inventories of critical 
items in order to respond to greater than expected needs for such items 
during epidemic, pandemic, emergency, national emergency, or natural 
disaster situations.

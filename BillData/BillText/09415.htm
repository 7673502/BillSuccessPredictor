To provide for an analysis and plan with respect to addressing the heat 
    island effect on military installations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Surveying the Heat Island Effect 
across Large Divisions Act'' or the ``SHIELD Act''.

SEC. 2. ANALYSIS AND PLAN FOR ADDRESSING HEAT ISLAND EFFECT ON MILITARY 
              INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Installation Analysis.--At the direction of the Secretary of 
Defense, the commander of each large military installation (as 
determined by the Secretary) shall conduct an analysis of--
            (1) how the effect known as the ``heat island effect'' 
        exacerbates summer heat conditions and necessitates the 
        increased use of air conditioning on the installation; and
            (2) inventory on the percentage of tree cover and plant 
        shade trees on the property of the installation.
    (b) Report.--Not later than September 30, 2023, the commander of 
each large military installation shall submit to the Secretary of the 
analysis conducted by the commander under subsection (a).
    (c) Plan.--The Secretary shall--
            (1) review the reports submitted under subsection (b);
            (2) identify any installation that is a significant heat 
        island with large expanses of concrete or asphalt; and
            (3) direct the commander of any installation so identified 
        to increase the tree coverage on the property of the 
        installation by 10 to 30 percent by not later than September 
        30, 2025.
    (d) Heat Island Defined.--The term ``heat island'' means an area 
with a high concentration of structures (such as building, roads, and 
other infrastructure) that absorb and re-emit the sun's heat more than 
natural landscapes such as forests or bodies of water.

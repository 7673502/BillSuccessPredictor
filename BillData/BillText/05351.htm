 To ensure the United States maintains a competitive edge over China, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prioritizing Readiness and 
Competitiveness Act'' or the ``PRC Act''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States that--
            (1) great power competition with the People's Republic of 
        China will define the future of the 21st century;
            (2) the People's Republic of China is a revisionist power 
        that seeks to upend the international system in ways that are 
        inimical to United States national interests;
            (3) great power competition with the People's Republic of 
        China is global in nature and requires a whole-of-government 
        response;
            (4) resilient domestic manufacturing, a strong and advanced 
        United States Navy, and an innovative economy are critical to 
        succeeding in great power competition; and
            (5) promoting and supporting new technological research and 
        development will be necessary to maintain a competitive 
        advantage and effectively combat hostile efforts by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China.

SEC. 3. TRANSFER OF CERTAIN UNEXPENDED FUNDS RELATED TO AFGHANISTAN FOR 
              THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING A RESILIENT DOMESTIC INDUSTRIAL 
              BASE AND STRENGTHENING DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION.

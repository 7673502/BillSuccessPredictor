                                 A BILL


 
   To support national training, technical assistance, and resource 
  centers, to ensure that all individuals with significant expressive 
    communication disabilities have access to the augmentative and 
alternative communication the individuals need to interact with others, 
 in order to learn, work, socialize, and take advantage of all aspects 
                     of life in the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Augmentative and Alternative 
Communication Centers to Establish National Training Act'' or the 
``AACCENT Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Communication is a basic human need and fundamental 
        right, and is essential to self-determination, social 
        inclusion, and emotional and physical well-being. In enacting a 
        provision of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 
        (referred to in this section as the ``ADA''), Congress 
        recognized that ``physical or mental disabilities in no way 
        diminish a person's right to fully participate in all aspects 
        of society,'' and that ``the discriminatory effects of 
        communication barriers'' are a form of discrimination.
            (2) Three decades after the passage of the ADA, Americans 
        with significant expressive communication disabilities still 
        experience discrimination in the form of communication 
        barriers, institutionalization, segregation, and relegation to 
        lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other 
        opportunities compared to Americans without significant 
        expressive communication disabilities.
            (3) Data about augmentative and alternative communication 
        is lacking, but it is estimated there are at least 4,000,000 
        people in the United States who cannot reliably meet their 
        daily communication needs using natural speech.
            (4) The population of individuals with significant 
        expressive communication difficulties is at substantial risk 
        for limited education, unemployment, poor health outcomes, 
        poverty, and low quality of life.
            (5) People can acquire a significant expressive 
        communication disability and need augmentative and alternative 
        communication as a result of many health and developmental 
        conditions at all stages of life.
            (6) Research indicates that individuals who belong to 
        racial or ethnic minority communities face a greater likelihood 
        of being born with or acquiring expressive communication 
        disabilities, as well as added difficulties in obtaining 
        intervention services, including augmentative and alternative 
        communication.
            (7) Individuals with significant expressive communication 
        disabilities, schools, families, employers, direct support 
        providers, health care providers, the justice system, and the 
        general public need more information about how to effectively 
        deploy, implement, and ensure continued access to robust 
        communication tools, services, and other supports for 
        individuals with significant expressive communication 
        disabilities.
            (8) The lived experiences and writings of individuals with 
        significant expressive communication disabilities demonstrate 
        the positive impact augmentative and alternative communication 
        has on their lives. These lived experiences and writings also 
        illustrate the harm that results from denying augmentative and 
        alternative communication to those who need it.
            (9) The leadership of individuals with significant 
        expressive communication disabilities is critical in crafting 
        and implementing effective policies and programs affecting 
        their lives, including policies and programs regarding 
        augmentative and alternative communication.
            (10) The freedoms of expression, and to be understood, are 
        essential to both democracy and to individual well-being. 
        Individuals with significant expressive communication 
        disabilities must be afforded equal rights, opportunities, 
        strategies, technologies, services, and other supports to 
        effectively express themselves and participate in their 
        communities and in democracy.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to work toward eliminating the continued 
discrimination, isolation, marginalization, and denial of equal 
opportunity of individuals with significant expressive communication 
disabilities by providing for comprehensive national training, 
technical assistance, and resource centers to improve access to--
            (1) a full range of augmentative and alternative 
        communication;
            (2) equal opportunity;
            (3) awareness and implementation of relevant laws, 
        policies, and practices;
            (4) leadership and self-advocacy skills;
            (5) capacity, in the case of individuals with significant 
        expressive communication disabilities, educators, 
        professionals, and families;
            (6) national statistical data; and
            (7) societal awareness.

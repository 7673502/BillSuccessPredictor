SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The effectiveness of United States foreign assistance 
        can be greatly enhanced by fostering innovation, applying 
        research and technology, and leveraging the expertise and 
        resources of the private sector to find cost-effective 
        solutions to today's most pressing development challenges.
            (2) Partnerships with entrepreneurs, experts, 
        nongovernmental organizations, universities, and science and 
        research institutions allow the United States to find solutions 
        to specific development challenges in a faster, more cost-
        efficient, and more financially sustainable way.
            (3) Enhancing the authorities that support results-based 
        and pay-for-success innovation models will better enable USAID 
        to diversify and expand both the number and sources of ideas 
        that may be developed, tested, and brought to scale, thereby 
        increasing the USAID's opportunity to apply high value, cost-
        effective solutions to global development challenges.
            (4) As demonstrated by USAID's Development Innovation 
        Ventures program, innovation within United States foreign 
        assistance can generate high social returns when it is centered 
        on the creation of and reliance on rigorous evidence of impact 
        on global development outcomes, a focus on cost-effectiveness, 
        and attention to financially sustainable scaling pathways.
            (5) Enabling uptake of evidence-based innovation across 
        USAID's operating units will enable USAID to scale breakthrough 
        solutions that accelerate economic growth and produce better 
        development outcomes, which can help support the growth of 
        healthier, more stable societies and foster trade relationships 
        that translate into jobs and economic growth in the United 
        States.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that innovation is central to 
identifying solutions to global development challenges.

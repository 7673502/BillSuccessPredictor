                                 AN ACT


 
  To amend chapter 36 of title 44, United States Code, to improve the 
    cybersecurity of the Federal Government, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``FedRAMP Authorization Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Ensuring that the Federal Government can securely 
        leverage cloud computing products and services is key to 
        expediting the modernization of legacy information technology 
        systems, increasing cybersecurity within and across departments 
        and agencies, and supporting the continued leadership of the 
        United States in technology innovation and job creation.
            (2) According to independent analysis, as of calendar year 
        2019, the size of the cloud computing market had tripled since 
        2004, enabling more than 2,000,000 jobs and adding more than 
        $200,000,000,000 to the gross domestic product of the United 
        States.
            (3) The Federal Government, across multiple presidential 
        administrations and Congresses, has continued to support the 
        ability of agencies to move to the cloud, including through--
                    (A) President Barack Obama's ``Cloud First 
                Strategy'';
                    (B) President Donald Trump's ``Cloud Smart 
                Strategy'';
                    (C) the prioritization of cloud security in 
                Executive Order No. 14028 (86 Fed. Reg. 26633; relating 
                to improving the nation's cybersecurity), which was 
                issued by President Joe Biden; and
                    (D) more than a decade of appropriations and 
                authorization legislation that provides agencies with 
                relevant authorities and appropriations to modernize 
                on-premises information technology systems and more 
                readily adopt cloud computing products and services.
            (4) Since it was created in 2011, the Federal Risk and 
        Authorization Management Program (referred to in this section 
        as ``FedRAMP'') at the General Services Administration has made 
        steady and sustained improvements in supporting the secure 
        authorization and reuse of cloud computing products and 
        services within the Federal Government, including by reducing 
        the costs and burdens on both agencies and cloud companies to 
        quickly and securely enter the Federal market.
            (5) According to data from the General Services 
        Administration, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, there were 
        239 cloud providers with FedRAMP authorizations, and those 
        authorizations had been reused more than 2,700 times across 
        various agencies.
            (6) Providing a legislative framework for FedRAMP and new 
        authorities to the General Services Administration, the Office 
        of Management and Budget, and Federal agencies will--
                    (A) improve the speed at which new cloud computing 
                products and services can be securely authorized;
                    (B) enhance the ability of agencies to effectively 
                evaluate FedRAMP authorized providers for reuse;
                    (C) reduce the costs and burdens to cloud providers 
                seeking a FedRAMP authorization; and
                    (D) provide for more robust transparency and 
                dialogue between industry and the Federal Government to 
                drive stronger adoption of secure cloud capabilities, 
                create jobs, and reduce wasteful legacy information 
                technology.

                                 AN ACT


 
To provide for the National Academies to study and report on a Federal 
  research agenda to advance the understanding of PFAS, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal PFAS Research Evaluation 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
        are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in a wide 
        range of products since the 1940s including firefighting foam, 
        carpeting, packaging, and cookware. There are more than 5,000 
        types of registered PFAS compounds. This chemical class is not 
        currently regulated at the Federal level.
            (2) PFAS have been detected in air, water, soil, food, 
        biosolids, and more. They can accumulate and remain in the body 
        for a long time, and potentially lead to serious health effects 
        including cancer, low infant birthweight, liver and kidney 
        issues, reproductive and developmental problems, and more.
            (3) There remains much unknown about PFAS toxicity, human 
        and environmental health effects, exposure pathways, as well as 
        effective removal, treatment, and destruction methods, and safe 
        alternatives to PFAS.
            (4) Federal research efforts have been fragmented at 
        various agencies and struggled to effectively address the full 
        scope of challenges presented by PFAS.
            (5) Regulatory action and cleanup depend on scientific 
        analysis of toxicity data, decision making on how best to deal 
        with PFAS, and understanding the significance of the many 
        exposure pathways that exist. A consensus study by the National 
        Academies would help inform decisions by Federal and State 
        Governments, industry, and other stakeholders on how to best 
        address PFAS.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORTS.

    (a) Research Assessments of PFAS.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date on 
        which amounts are appropriated for fiscal year 2023 to carry 
        out this section, the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency, in consultation with the Director of the 
        National Science Foundation, the Secretary of Defense, the 
        Director of the National Institutes of Health, and other 
        Federal agencies with expertise relevant to understanding PFAS 
        exposure, behavior, and toxicity, shall enter into an agreement 
        with the National Academies to conduct a study and submit a 
        report in accordance with this subsection to further address 
        research and knowledge gaps identified by the Federal 
        Government Human Health PFAS Research Workshop held on October 
        26 and 27, 2020, and identify research and development needed 
        to identify, categorize, evaluate, and address individual or 
        total PFAS.
            (2) Study and report on human exposure estimation.--
                    (A) In general.--The study required to be conducted 
                under paragraph (1) shall, at a minimum--
                            (i) consider life-cycle information on the 
                        manufacture, use, and disposal of PFAS-
                        containing products to identify potential human 
                        exposure sources, including occupational 
                        exposures, and potential exposure pathways for 
                        the public;
                            (ii) evaluate the fate and transport of 
                        PFAS and their breakdown products;
                            (iii) if feasible, estimate human exposure 
                        to individual or total PFAS to determine 
                        relative source contributions for various 
                        exposure pathways (such as air, water, soil, or 
                        food);
                            (iv) determine the range of solubility, 
                        stability, and volatility of PFAS most likely 
                        to be found in the environment and the 
                        resulting prevalence in animals and humans;
                            (v) give consideration as to whether 
                        chemical category-based approaches would be 
                        appropriate for evaluating PFAS toxicity and 
                        exposure;
                            (vi) identify research needed to advance 
                        exposure estimation to individual or total 
                        PFAS; and
                            (vii) identify research needed to advance 
                        toxicity and hazard assessment of individual or 
                        total PFAS.
                    (B) Report.--Not later than 540 days after the date 
                on which the agreement described in paragraph (1) is 
                finalized, the National Academies shall submit to 
                Congress a report containing the findings and 
                recommendations of the study described in subparagraph 
                (A) and shall make such report available on a publicly 
                accessible website.
    (b) Research Assessment of Management and Treatment Alternatives 
for PFAS Contamination in the Environment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date on 
        which amounts are appropriated for fiscal year 2023 to carry 
        out this section, the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency and the Director of the National Science 
        Foundation, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and 
        other Federal agencies with expertise relevant to the 
        development of PFAS alternatives and the management and 
        treatment of PFAS, shall jointly enter into an agreement with 
        the National Academies to conduct a study and submit a report 
        in accordance with this subsection to better understand the 
        research and development needed to advance the understanding of 
        the extent and implications of human and environmental 
        contamination by PFAS, how to manage and treat such 
        contamination, and the development of safe alternatives.
            (2) Scope of study.--The study described in paragraph (1)

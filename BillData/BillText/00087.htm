                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit the importation or 
       transportation of child sex dolls, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jurists United to Stop Trafficking 
Imitation Child Exploitation Act of 2021'' or the ``JUSTICE Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) There is a correlation between possession of the 
        obscene dolls, and robots, and possession of and participation 
        in child pornography.
            (2) The physical features, and potentially the 
        ``personalities'' of the robots are customizable or morphable 
        and can resemble actual children.
            (3) Some owners and makers of the robots have made their 
        children interact with the robots as if the robots are members 
        of the family.
            (4) The robots can have settings that simulate rape.
            (5) The dolls and robots not only lead to rape, but they 
        make rape easier by teaching the rapist about how to overcome 
        resistance and subdue the victim.
            (6) For users and children exposed to their use, the dolls 
        and robots normalize submissiveness and normalize sex between 
        adults and minors.
            (7) As the Supreme Court has recognized, obscene material 
        is often used as part of a method of seducing child victims.
            (8) The dolls and robots are intrinsically related to abuse 
        of minors, and they cause the exploitation, objectification, 
        abuse, and rape of minors.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION OF IMPORTATION OR TRANSPORTATION OF CHILD SEX 
              DOLLS.

    Section 1462 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (a), by striking ``or'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (b), by striking ``or'' at the end;
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (c) the following:
    ``(d) any child sex doll; or''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following:
    ``In this section, the term `child sex doll' means an anatomically 
correct doll, mannequin, or robot, with the features of, or with 
features that resemble those of, a minor, intended for use in sexual 
acts.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

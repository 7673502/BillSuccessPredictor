United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Compact of Free Association Host 
Communities Support Act''.

SEC. 2. WAIVER OF MATCHING FUNDS REQUIREMENT.

funds.

SEC. 3. RECONCILIATION OF UNREIMBURSED IMPACT EXPENSES.

    (a) In General.--To address previously accrued and unreimbursed 
impact expenses, at the request of the Governor of an affected 
jurisdiction, the President may reduce, release, or waive all or part 
of amounts owed by the Government of an affected jurisdiction (or the 
government's autonomous agencies or instrumentalities) to any 
department, agency, independent agency, office, or instrumentality of 
the United States.
    (b) Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) Substantiation of impact costs.--Not later than 120 
        days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Governor 
        of each affected jurisdiction shall submit to the Secretary a 
        report, prepared in consultation with an independent accounting 
        firm, substantiating unreimbursed economic impacts to the 
        affected jurisdiction of receiving compact migrants from 2004 
        through 2021. Upon request of the Secretary, the Governor of 
        the affected jurisdiction shall submit to the Secretary copies 
        of all documents upon which the report submitted by that 
        Governor was based.
            (2) Congressional review and comment.--Any reduction, 
        release, or waiver under this Act shall not take effect until

        President's intent to approve a request of the Governor of each 
        affected jurisdiction. In exercising his authority under this 
        section and in determining whether to give final approval to a 
        request, the President shall take into consideration comments 
        the President may receive after Congressional review.

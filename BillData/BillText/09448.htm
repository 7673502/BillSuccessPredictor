_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the Federal Government from taking certain action relating 
           to social media companies, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Free Speech Defense Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The First Amendment guarantees freedoms concerning 
        religion, expression, assembly, and petition of the government. 
        The First Amendment guarantees the freedom of expression by 
        prohibiting the government from restricting the press or the 
        right of an individual to speak freely. The First Amendment 
        also guarantees the right of an individual to assemble 
        peaceably and to petition the government.
            (2) The Fourth Amendment states that each individual is 
        secure from unreasonable searches and seizures of property by 
        the government. The Fourth Amendment protects against arbitrary 
        arrests, wiretaps, and other forms of surveillance conducted 
        without a search warrant.
            (3) In July 2021, the White House press secretary, Jen 
        Psaki, admitted that the White House was working with social 
        media companies to identify ``misinformation.''
            (4) Specifically, Psaki said, ``[W]e're regularly making 
        sure social media platforms are aware of the latest narratives, 
        dangerous to public health that we and many other Americans are 
        seeing across all of social and traditional media.''. Psaki 
        also said, ``[W]e work to engage with them to better understand 
        the enforcement of social media platform policies.''.
            (5) 286 pages of documents produced in July 2022 by the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in response to a 
        Freedom of Information Act request submitted by the America 
        First Legal Foundation, revealed shocking information, 
        including the following:
                    (A) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                sent to officials of Twitter a chart of tweets that the 
                Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined 
                to be ``misinformation''.
                    (B) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                held regular BOLO (Be On The Lookout) meetings in which 
                the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would 
                share with social media companies, including Twitter 
                and Facebook, what the Centers for Disease Control and 
                Prevention determined to be ``misinformation''. In the 
                meetings, the Centers for Disease Control and 
                Prevention would provide slide decks requesting, among 
                other things, ``[p]lease do not share outside your 
                trust and safety teams''.
                    (C) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                recommended to Twitter that information about the 
                Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System be added to 
                tweets.
                    (D) Officials from the Centers for Disease Control 
                and Prevention directly engaged with Facebook, 
                requesting that Facebook flag certain posts as 
                disinformation and ensure that ``verifiable information 
                sources'' were not blocked because posts on Facebook by 
                State Health Departments were being blocked as vaccine 
                misinformation.
                    (E) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                created a COVID-19 Misinformation Reporting Channel for 
                the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the 
                Census Bureau to make reports to Facebook and held a 
                ``training meeting'' about the Misinformation Reporting 
                Channel.
                    (F) $15,000,000 of Facebook advertising credits 
                were provided to the Centers for Disease Control and 
                Prevention and the Department of Health and Human 
                Services as a ``non-monetary gift'' to promote 
                vaccines, social distancing, travel, and priority 
                communication messages, which may have violated the 
                limitation on voluntary services described in section 
                1342 of the Antideficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1342).
            (6) The Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, 
        failed to provide clear answers to Congress about the so-called 
        ``Disinformation Governance Board'' and the selection of Nina 
        Jankowicz to lead the Disinformation Governance Board.
            (7) Damning whistleblower documents revealed by Senators 
        Josh Hawley and Chuck Grassley show the shocking extent to 
        which the Disinformation Governance Board was willing to spy on 
        Americans, without a warrant, and flag posts for social media 
        companies as so-called ``disinformation''.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that:
            (1) The records produced by the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention in response to the Freedom of Information Act 
        request described in section 2(5) reveal the extent to which 
        the Biden Administration is willing to engage in 
        unconstitutional and otherwise unlawful activities in total 
        disregard of the rights of the American people.
            (2) The ``Disinformation Governance Board'' established by 
        the Department of Homeland Security is unconstitutional and 
        should be terminated immediately.
            (3) The failure of Secretary Mayorkas to provide clear 
        answers about the Disinformation Governance Board is 
        disqualifying, and Secretary Mayorkas should resign 
        immediately.
            (4) The antidote to ``misinformation'' and 
        ``disinformation'' is not censorship but more information, so 
        the American people can make informed decisions independently.
            (5) The Federal Government should not be allowed to 
        circumvent the Constitution of the United States through 
        intermediaries and third parties to violate the rights of the 
        American people to information and freedom from intrusion by 
        the Federal Government, even if the information is not 
        consistent with the views of officials in the Federal 
        Government.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST FEDERAL REGULATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA 
              COMPANIES.

                the social media company as information, 
                disinformation, true, false, or any other similar 
                characterization; or
                    (C) share with the Federal Government data or

                        users; and
                            (ii) the content such users share on the

        similar to the Disinformation Governance Board terminated 
        pursuant to paragraph (1).
    (d) Prohibition Against Soliciting or Accepting Free Social Media 
Advertising.--
            (1) In general.--An agency employee may not solicit or 
        accept, or enter into a contract or other agreement (including 
        a no-cost agreement) for, free advertising or other promotion

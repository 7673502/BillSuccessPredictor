                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            August 23, 2022

  Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York introduced the following bill; 
          which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To establish reasonable controls on firearms manufacturers and 
                   importers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Firearm Industry Crime and 
Trafficking Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The firearm industry has engaged in dangerous business 
        practices, flooding American communities with weapons of war 
        like AR-15s and other semiautomatic weapons. Despite these 
        practices, the firearm industry is not required to monitor its 
        distribution to ensure that its products are not used for 
        unlawful purposes.
            (2) A study conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
        Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) found that 5 percent of licensed 
        dealers sell about 90 percent of guns used in crimes (also 
        known as ``crime guns''). Firearm manufacturers, through trace 
        data provided by the ATF, often know exactly which dealers and 
        distributors disproportionately sell these crime guns.
            (3) Despite these indicators of diversion, firearm 
        manufacturers have failed to adequately curtail their 
        distribution practices and sought to evade any responsibility 
        for preventing the widespread misuse of their products--
        rejecting ATF resources and failing to effect change at the top 
        of the distribution pyramid.
            (4) Firearm manufacturers also sell dangerous firearms to 
        distributors and retailers who, according to ATF data, can fail 
        to comply with Federal firearms law. The trace analysis of 
        2,000 firearms dealers cited by the ATF found that half of the 
        dealers sold firearms to customers without conducting the 
        background checks required by Federal law. Firearms dealers 
        often flouted Federal laws and regulations, sold weapons to 
        convicted felons and domestic abusers, lied to investigators, 
        and falsified records.

SEC. 3. REQUIREMENT TO CREATE REASONABLE CONTROLS AND MONITORING 
              SYSTEM.

    Each manufacturer or importer of firearms in or affecting 
interstate commerce shall implement reasonable controls to prevent, and 
create and maintain a monitoring database to retain essential facts 
concerning, the criminal diversion or potential misuse of their 
products.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.

    It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer or importer of firearms 
in or affecting interstate commerce to--
            (1) supply a firearm to a distributor or retailer of the 
        firearm, knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the 
        distributor or retailer has failed to implement reasonable 
        controls or engaged in distribution, sales, or other practices 
        likely to result in a high risk of criminal diversion or 
        misuse;
            (2) fail to investigate or inquire as to the distribution 
        practices of such a distributor or retailer, knowing or having 
        reasonable cause to believe that the distributor or retailer 
        has failed to implement reasonable controls or engaged in 
        distribution, sales, or other practices likely to result in a 
        high risk of criminal diversion or misuse; or
            (3) supply a quantity of firearms to a State or 
        distribution area, knowing or having reasonable cause to 
        believe that the quantity exceeds the lawful demand for 
        firearms in the State or distribution area.

SEC. 5. REQUIRED ACTIVITIES.

    Each manufacturer or importer of firearms in or affecting 
interstate commerce shall--
            (1) report to the Director on any pattern, distribution, or 
        repeated instances of a distributor or retailer of a firearm 
        whom the firearm manufacturer or importer knows or has 
        reasonable cause to believe has failed to implement reasonable 
        controls or engaged in distribution, sales, or other practices 
        likely to result in a high risk of criminal diversion or 
        misuse;
            (2) report to the Director annually, in such form and 
        manner as the Director shall prescribe, all instances of 
        criminal diversion or misuse of a product distributed or sold 
        by the manufacturer or importer, as the case may be, of which 
        the manufacturer or importer, as the case may be, is aware, and 
        shall include in the report an itemization of the firearms 
        involved by category; and
            (3) keep for a period of 5 years all trace records, 
        relevant communications, and other relevant information 
        pertaining to the monitoring database of the manufacturer or 
        importer, as the case may be.

SEC. 6. EXEMPTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Sections 3 through 5 shall not apply to a 
manufacturer who manufactures fewer than 3,000 firearms per year.
    (b) Waiver Authority.--The Director may waive the applicability of 
such sections to a manufacturer who manufactures not more than 6,000 
firearms per year, on finding that the provision of such a waiver will 
not harm public safety, except that the Director may not provide such a 
waiver to a manufacturer who manufactures a semiautomatic firearm or 
any copy, duplicate, variant, or altered facsimile with the capability 
of a semiautomatic firearm.

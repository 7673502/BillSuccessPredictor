_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend title 28, United States Code, to provide a civil action 
  against a foreign state for deliberate concealment or distortion of 
 information with respect to an international public health emergency, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Holding the Chinese Communist Party 
Accountable for Infecting Americans Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Chinese Communist Party covered up the existence 
        and downplayed the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2, hereinafter 
        referred to as COVID-19, at least as early as December 2019.
            (2) Chinese government officials engaged in a campaign to 
        silence and delegitimize doctors--including Dr. Li Wenliang--
        who were warning their colleagues and others about COVID-19.
            (3) Chinese government officials ordered the destruction of 
        laboratory samples and research regarding COVID-19 in January 
        2020.
            (4) Chinese government officials have detained or otherwise 
        silenced researchers, journalists, and citizens who attempted 
        to share information that could have proven unflattering to the 
        Chinese government's response to the COVID-19 outbreak.
            (5) Chinese government officials have expelled American 
        journalists who were covering the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
            (6) Chinese government officials have attempted to censor 
        or destroy academic research into COVID-19 and its origins that 
        might disagree with the official positions of the Chinese 
        government.
            (7) Chinese government officials have intentionally 
        underreported or altered official numbers of COVID-19 
        infections and deaths in China, leading world health experts to 
        make flawed analyses that severely underestimated the nature 
        and seriousness of COVID-19.
            (8) Academic studies have shown that, had appropriate 
        interventions occurred to stop the spread of COVID-19 even just 
        weeks earlier, the spread of COVID-19 would have been severely 
        curtailed.
            (9) The cover-up of COVID-19 by the Chinese government has 
        caused significant economic harm in the United States and 
        around the world.
            (10) The cover-up of COVID-19 by the Chinese government has 
        caused significant death and injury in the United States and 
        around the world.
            (11) The cover-up of COVID-19 by the Chinese government is, 
        at minimum, grossly negligent behavior causing significant 
        injury.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to provide civil litigants with the 
broadest possible basis, consistent with the Constitution of the United 
States, to seek relief against persons, entities, and foreign 
countries, wherever acting and wherever they may be found, that are 
responsible for, or complicit in ordering, controlling, or otherwise 
directing acts intended to deliberately conceal or distort the 
existence or nature of COVID-19, if such acts are found to have likely 
contributed to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

SEC. 4. RESPONSIBILITY OF FOREIGN STATES FOR DELIBERATE CONCEALMENT OR 
              DISTORTING INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH 
              EMERGENCIES.

                the foreign state, if the Secretary of State certifies 
                that the United States is engaged in good faith 
                discussions with the foreign state defendant, or any 
                other defendant, with respect to the resolution of a 
                claim against such a defendant.

                            ``(ii) Extension.--

                                if the Secretary of State recertifies 
                                that the United States remains engaged 
                                in good faith discussions with the 
                                foreign state defendant or any other 
                                defendant concerning the resolution of 
                                a claim against the foreign state or

        States may dismiss with prejudice a proceeding under this 
        section against a foreign state or any official, employee, or

        that the United States and the foreign state have entered into 
        an agreement with respect to the resolution of a claim against 
        such a defendant, regardless of whether the plaintiff is a 
        party to such agreement or consents to the dismissal.

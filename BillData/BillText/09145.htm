                                 A BILL


 
 To ensure that significantly more students graduate college with the 
international knowledge and experience essential for success in today's 
  global economy through the establishment of the Senator Paul Simon 
            Study Abroad Program in the Department of State.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad 
Program Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global 
        economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as 
        part of a well-rounded education.
            (2) Study abroad programs provide students with 
        unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched 
        opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique 
        environment for developing cultural understanding, all of which 
        are knowledge and skills needed in today's global economy.
            (3) Because only 10 percent of United States college 
        students study abroad before they graduate, meaning that 90 
        percent of graduates are entering the workforce without the 
        global skills, knowledge, and experiences afforded by study 
        abroad programs that will position them for success in the 
        global economy. Minority students, first generation college 
        students, community college students, and students with 
        disabilities are also significantly underrepresented in study 
        abroad participation.
            (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission 
        on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program pursuant 
        to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations and Offsets 
        Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199). Pursuant to its 
        mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to Congress and the 
        President a report of its recommendations for greatly expanding 
        the opportunity for students at institutions of higher 
        education in the United States to study abroad, with special 
        emphasis on studying in developing nations.
            (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience 
        shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will 
        drive the number of study abroad participants higher and 
        improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only 
        way that study abroad will become an integral part of the 
        undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is 
        necessary to encourage and support such leadership.
            (6) Student health, safety, and security while studying 
        abroad is and must continue to be a priority for institutions 
        of higher education and study abroad programs.
            (7) The COVID-19 pandemic has limited or prevented students 
        from participating in study abroad due to travel restrictions 
        and reduced budgets. In a post-pandemic world, increasing 
        access to study abroad for students at institutions of higher 
        education across the United States will be critical to ensuring 
        that those students gain the skills, knowledge, and experiences 
        necessary to maintain the leadership of the United States in 
        tackling global challenges, like pandemics, and succeeding in a 
        global economy.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access 
        to quality study abroad opportunities;
            (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying 
        abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of 
        higher education in the United States;
            (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad 
        destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that 
        takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations, 
        especially in developing countries; and
            (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of 
        higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.

SEC. 4. SENATOR PAUL SIMON STUDY ABROAD PROGRAM.

    (a) Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program.--
            (1) Establishment.--Subject to the availability of

                will reflect the demographics of the United States

                participation of underrepresented groups; and
                    (C) an increasing portion of study abroad will take 
                place in nontraditional study abroad destinations, with

                countries.

                    (E) demonstrate that the programs have established 
                health, safety, and security guidelines and procedures, 
                informed by Department of State travel advisories and 
                other appropriate Federal agencies and resources, 
                including the Overseas Security Advisory Council and

SEC. 309. MEASURES TO MITIGATE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE THREATS FROM 
              PROLIFERATION AND USE OF FOREIGN COMMERCIAL SPYWARE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The proliferation of foreign commercial spyware poses 
        an acute and emergent threat to the national security of the 
        United States.
            (2) Foreign entities have developed and supplied foreign 
        commercial spyware to other foreign governments that used these 
        tools to maliciously target officials of the United States 
        Government. Many of those foreign governments have, in service 
        of their repressive activities, targeted journalists, 
        businesspeople, activists, academics, and other persons.
            (3) Furthermore, public reports suggest that foreign 
        companies involved in the proliferation of foreign commercial 
        spyware maintain close ties to foreign governments and their 
        intelligence services. This close relationship between foreign 
        governments and the companies selling foreign commercial 
        spyware furthers the already substantial counterintelligence 
        concerns for any end-user of these products, including 
        potential end-users in the United States.
            (4) To mitigate the grave counterintelligence threat posed 
        by the rapid spread of these tools--as well as to improve the 
        digital security of citizens of the United States, combat cyber 
        threats, and mitigate unlawful surveillance--the United States 
        on January 19, 2022, finalized a rule establishing controls on 
        the export, reexport, or in-country transfer of certain items 
        that can be used for malicious cyber activities.
            (5) In furtherance of the same national security 
        objectives, the Commerce Department on November 4, 2021, 
        released a rule adding four foreign companies to the Entity 
        List for engaging in activities that are contrary to the 
        national security or foreign policy interests of the United 
        States. This rule had the practical effect of preventing the 
        listed companies from receiving American technologies.
            (6) Subsequent public reports indicate that at least one of 
        the four companies added to the Entity List attempted to evade 
        these and other restrictions, and a private consultancy which 
        oversees that company informed the European Parliament in 2022 
        that it could not confirm the blacklisted company is complying 
        with all relevant laws and regulatory frameworks.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
intelligence community, with its unique authorities, foreign 
intelligence mission, analytical capabilities, and other capabilities, 
is best positioned to lead the efforts of the United States Government 
to mitigate the counterintelligence threats posed by the rapidly 
expanding ecosystem of foreign commercial spyware, including by 
devising and implementing strategies to protect personnel of the United 
States Government from being maliciously targeted.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to decisively act against counterintelligence threats posed by 
foreign commercial spyware, as well as the individuals who lead 
entities selling foreign commercial spyware and who are reasonably 
believed to be involved, have been involved, or pose a significant risk 
to being or becoming involved, in activities contrary to the national 
security or foreign policy interests of the United States.
    (d) Measures to Mitigate Counterintelligence Threats.--Title XI of 
the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3231 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 1102 the following new section (and 
conforming the table of contents at the beginning of such Act

        to the operational elements of the Department of Defense;
            (2) such products must be prepared with the rigor necessary 
        to determine the status of a potential terrorist target, the 
        role of the target, how critical the target is to the 
        operations of a terrorist group, and the effect removing that 
        individual would have on the strategic threat to the United 
        States, United States persons overseas, members of the United 
        States Armed Forces overseas, or facilities of the United 
        States overseas; and
            (3) the intelligence community is also responsible for 
        assessing the strategic impact of counterterrorism strikes to 
        determine whether the anticipated or desired impact on the 
        terrorist group or network was achieved.
    (b) Intelligence Assessment.--The Director of the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, in coordination with the directorates of 
intelligence of the combatant commands, shall produce an intelligence

the following:
            (1) With respect to the counterterrorism strikes covered by

                on the planned external operations of the respective 
                terrorist group, particularly the operations targeting 
                the United States, United States persons overseas, 
                members of the United States Armed Forces overseas, or 
                facilities of the United States overseas;
                    (B) the effects of the strike on the intent of the 
                respective terrorist group to conduct external 
                operations, particularly the operations targeting the 
                United States, United States persons overseas, members 
                of the United States Armed Forces overseas, or 
                facilities of the United States overseas;
                    (C) the effects of the strike on the recruitment of 
                the respective terrorist group;
                    (D) the effects of the strike on the local 
                perception of the respective terrorist group, the host 
                country, and the United States; and
                    (E) the effects of the strike on the capabilities 
                of the host country to conduct operations against the 
                targeted group.
            (2) An identification of the number and quality of finished 
        intelligence products that assessed the effects that a 
        counterterrorism strike of the United States would have, or did 
        have, against specific terrorist individuals or groups.
            (3) Recommendations to improve the efficacy, accuracy, and 
        timeliness of intelligence analysis to increase the strategic 
        effect of counterterrorism strikes.
    (d) Report.--
            (1) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director shall submit to the

SEC. 502. OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE POLICIES OF 
              THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the intelligence community must rapidly adopt 
        artificial intelligence into its workflows to compete with 
        United States adversaries, and keep pace with and leverage 
        commercial cutting-edge technologies;
            (2) while pockets of success are present across the 
        intelligence community, Congress is concerned that artificial 
        intelligence has not scaled appropriately and continues to lag 
        behind industry;
            (3) broadly, Congress believes that the Director of 
        National Intelligence should be primarily responsible for 
        setting the policies and procedures as they relate to 
        artificial intelligence adoption, acquiring any necessary 
        common infrastructure such as training data, intelligence 
        community-wide contracts for data labelers, cloud storage and 
        compute capabilities, and other infrastructure necessary for 
        intelligence community elements rapidly to adopt artificial 
        intelligence; and
            (4) the heads of the elements of the intelligence community 
        should be primarily responsible for acquiring and developing 
        agency-specific artificial intelligence applications, in 
        coordination with the Director and the heads of the elements of 
        the intelligence community, and assisting the Director with 
        preparing the necessary infrastructure such as data, hardware, 
        and software for the intelligence community to adopt artificial 
        intelligence applications.
    (b) Requirement to Develop Definition.--Section 309(a) of the 
Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 (50 U.S.C.

issue guidance for carrying out the amendments made by subsection (a).

SEC. 512. OFFICES OF COMMERCIAL INTEGRATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress is concerned that the administrative and 
        technical burdens on small- and medium-sized emerging 
        technology companies to do business with the intelligence 
        community is inadvertently precluding the most cutting-edge, 
        advanced companies from contracting with the United States 
        Government;
            (2) this dynamic has significant negative consequences for 
        United States national security, including United States global 
        technological competitiveness in the fields of artificial 
        intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing, 
        among others;
            (3) some such companies have attempted still to contract 
        with the intelligence community by spending valuable capital 
        and time on government affairs experts to navigate the 
        challenges of integrating into the intelligence community, yet, 
        the administrative and technical burdens of contracting with 
        the intelligence community are often too high even for the 
        companies that are able to afford this consulting;
            (4) Congress believes that the United States Government has 
        both an obligation and an opportunity to assist these 
        technology companies navigate the hurdles it takes to work with 
        the intelligence community to ensure that the Federal 
        Government benefits from the best that the private sector has 
        to offer; and
            (5) doing so will help cultivate an ecosystem of cutting-
        edge technology companies that can provide products and 
        services that are essential to the missions of the intelligence 
        community, and advance the goal of ensuring United States 
        adversaries do not outpace the United States in these critical 
        fields.
    (b) Plan for Establishment.--
            (1) Submission.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director of National 
        Intelligence, in coordination with the heads of the elements of 
        the intelligence community, shall submit to the congressional 
        intelligence committees a plan for the establishment of an 
        office within each element, to be known as the ``Office of 
        Commercial Integration'' of that element, for the purpose of 
        providing administrative assistance to covered contractors.
            (2) Elements.--The plan under paragraph (1) shall include 
        the following:
                    (A) A proposal for the designation of a senior 
                official of the Office of the Director of National 
                Intelligence who shall be responsible for the 
                coordination across the Offices of Commercial 
                Integration.
                    (B) Guidelines requiring each Director of 
                Commercial Integration to share best practices and 
                other information, and coordinate, with the other 
                Directors of Commercial Integration.
                    (C) A timeline of the steps necessary to establish 
                each Office of Commercial Integration by the date that 
                is not later than 2 years after the date of the 
                enactment of this Act.
                    (D) An assessment of the personnel requirements, 
                and any other resource requirements, necessary to 
                establish each Office of Commercial Integration by such 
                date, including an identification of--
                            (i) each Director of Commercial 
                        Integration;
                            (ii) the amount of personnel necessary for 
                        the establishment of each Office of Commercial 
                        Integration; and
                            (iii) the necessary qualifications of any 
                        such personnel.
                    (E) Policies regarding the types of administrative 
                assistance that may be provided to covered contractors 
                by each Office of Commercial Integration, taking into 
                account the role of such assistance as an incentive for 
                emerging technology companies to enter into contracts 
                with the heads of the elements of the intelligence 
                community. In developing such policies, the Director of 
                National Intelligence shall prioritize assistance to 
                reduce administrative burdens faced by preferred 
                contractors.
                    (F) Eligibility criteria for determining the types 
                of covered contractors that may receive administrative 
                assistance provided by each Office of Commercial 
                Integration.
                    (G) Guidelines that outline, with respect to a 
                contract, at what stage covered contractors determined 
                eligible pursuant to the criteria specified in 
                subparagraph (F) may receive such administrative 
                assistance.
                    (H) Policies regarding outreach efforts to be 
                conducted by each Director of Commercial Integration 
                with respect to such eligible covered contractors.
                    (I) Policies regarding how the intelligence 
                community will coordinate with the Director of the 
                Federal Bureau of Investigation to provide proactive 
                counterintelligence risk analysis and assistance to 
                private entities.
                    (J) Such other intelligence community-wide policies 
                as the Director of National Intelligence may prescribe 
                relating to the improvement of commercial integration 
                (and the coordination of such improvements) by and 
                among the elements of the intelligence community.

        department or agency to the Office of Commercial Integration 
        concerned.
            (3) Expertise.--In appointing personnel under paragraph (1) 
        and accepting detailed personnel pursuant to paragraph (2), 
        each Director of Commercial Integration shall seek to appoint 
        and accept personnel with expertise in a range of disciplines 
        necessary for the accelerated integration of commercial 
        technologies into the intelligence community (as determined by 
        the Director), including expertise in the administrative 
        burdens associated with the following:
                    (A) Authorization to operate certifications.

carry out a pilot program to more effectively transition eligible 
projects that present the potential to meet the operational needs of 
covered elements of the intelligence community to Phase III through the 
designation of eligible projects as Entrepreneurial Innovation 
Projects.
    (b) Designation.--
            (1) In general.--Under the pilot program under subsection 
        (a), each head of a covered element of the intelligence

        projects per year as Entrepreneurial Innovation Projects.
            (2) Required criteria.--The head of a covered element of 
        the intelligence community may designate an eligible project as 
        an Entrepreneurial Innovation Project under paragraph (1) if 
        the head determines the eligible project meets the following 
        criteria:
                    (A) The eligible project demonstrates the potential 
                to--
                            (i) advance the national security 
                        capabilities of the United States;
                            (ii) provide new technologies or processes, 
                        or new applications of existing technologies, 
                        that will enable new alternatives to existing 
                        programs, systems, and initiatives of the 
                        intelligence community;
                            (iii) provide future cost savings; or
                            (iv) significantly reduce the time to 
                        deliver capabilities to the intelligence 
                        community.
                    (B) Any other criteria that the head determines 
                appropriate.
            (3) Mitigation of conflicts of interest.--Each head of a 
        covered element of the intelligence community, in consultation 
        with the Director of National Intelligence, shall establish 
        procedures designed to mitigate, to the greatest extent 
        practicable, organizational conflicts of interest relating to 
        the designation of projects under paragraph (1), including 
        conflicts of interest from within a department or agency of the 
        United States Government for which the designation and 
        successful completion of an Entrepreneurial Innovation Project 
        may represent a competing alternative to an existing or 
        proposed program or other activity of such department or 
        agency.
            (4) Applications.--An eligible project seeking a 
        designation under paragraph (1) shall submit to the head of the 
        covered element of the intelligence community from which such 
        designation is sought an application containing--
                    (A) an explanation as to how the eligible project 
                meets the criteria specified in paragraph (2); and
                    (B) such other information as the head, in 
                consultation with the Director of National 
                Intelligence, considers appropriate.
            (5) Revocation of designation.--If the head of a covered 
        element of the intelligence community that previously 
        designated a project under paragraph (1) determines such 
        project no longer meets the required criteria specified in 
        paragraph (2), or that the technology that is the subject of 
        such project has become irrelevant, such head may revoke the 
        Entrepreneurial Innovation Project designation for such 
        project.
    (c) Benefits of Designation.--
            (1) Inclusion in multiyear national intelligence program 
        plan.--The Director of National Intelligence shall include in 
        the relevant multiyear national intelligence program plan

        the estimated expenditures of each designated project.
            (2) Inclusion under separate heading.--The designating head 
        shall ensure that each designated project is included under a 
        separate heading in the relevant multiyear national 
        intelligence program plan submitted to Congress under such 
        section 1403 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 1991 (50 U.S.C. 3301).
            (3) Consideration in programming and budgeting.--Each 
        designated project shall be taken into consideration by the 
        designating head in the programming and budgeting phases of the

SEC. 514. REDUCTION OF BARRIERS RELATING TO CONTRACTS FOR ARTIFICIAL 
              INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Authorizations to operate are essential to 
                maintaining network and system security.
                    (B) However, Congress is concerned that the 
                executive branch does not have a user-friendly platform 
                or process to adjudicate and review authority to 
                operate applications.
                    (C) Nor is the executive branch resourced to meet 
                the demand for authority to operate certifications from 
                commercial vendors, leading to lengthy delays to bring 
                commercial solutions into government networks and 
                systems.
                    (D) These barriers handicap the executive branch 
                when contracting for cutting-edge technologies.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the intelligence community and the Secretary of 
                Defense should develop a resourcing plan to address 
                these issues, including developing common platforms for 
                applications and requirements to be shared with 
                industry, and a process for authority to operate 
                certification reciprocity across the Department of 
                Defense and the intelligence community, with the 
                appropriate safeguards;
                    (B) easing these administrative costs and burdens 
                helps cultivate an ecosystem that incentivizes small- 
                and medium-sized emerging technology companies to work 
                with the Federal Government, which is essential for the 
                United States to compete globally for technology 
                supremacy;
                    (C) sensitive compartmented information facilities 
                are often requirements for companies that wish to 
                conduct business with the intelligence community;
                    (D) unfortunately, the process to accredit and 
                certify a facility as a sensitive compartmented 
                information facility is time consuming and expensive, 
                which further raises the barriers to entry for small- 
                and medium-sized emerging technology companies; and
                    (E) lowering those barriers is an important 
                function of the intelligence community to gain access 
                to the cutting-edge technology offered by such 
                companies.
    (b) Protocol on Authority to Operate Certifications.--
            (1) Protocol.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director of National 
        Intelligence, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, 
        shall develop and submit to the appropriate congressional 
        committees a protocol setting forth policies and procedures 
        relating to authority to operate certifications held by 
        commercial providers.
            (2) Elements.--The protocol under paragraph (1) shall 
        include, at a minimum, the following:
                    (A) A policy that ensures reciprocal recognition 
                among the elements of the intelligence community and 
                the Department of Defense of authority to operate 
                certifications held by commercial providers. Such 
                reciprocal recognition shall be limited to authority to 
                operate certifications for systems that store or 
                provide access to data classified at an equal or higher 
                classification level.
                    (B) Procedures under which a commercial provider 
                that is a contractor of an element of the intelligence 
                community or the Department of Defense and holds an 
                authority to operate certification for a system that 
                relates to the contract concerned may provide to head 
                of such element or the Secretary of Defense, as the 
                case may be, the most recently updated version of any 
                software, data, or application under such system 
                without being required to submit an application for a 
                new or renewed authority to operate certification.
                    (C) Procedures for the automated review, renewal, 
                and revocation of authority to operate certifications 
                held by commercial providers, subject to such 
                conditions as may be prescribed by the Director of 
                National Intelligence, in coordination with the 
                Secretary of Defense.
                    (D) Standard documentation requirements for 
                commercial providers submitting applications for 
                authority to operate certifications. Such requirements 
                shall be--
                            (i) established jointly by the Director of 
                        National Intelligence and the Secretary of 
                        Defense; and
                            (ii) except as provided in paragraph (3), 
                        uniform across the Department of Defense and 
                        the elements of the intelligence community for 
                        each appropriate level of security.
                    (E) A requirement to establish a joint portal of 
                the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and 
                the Department of Defense for the maintenance of 
                records, applications, and system requirements for 
                authority to operate certifications. Such portal shall 
                be designed to store unclassified information, but may 
                provide for the storage of classified information to

                National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense.
                    (F) A workforce plan that addresses the shortage of 
                personnel of the intelligence community who are 
                authorized to grant an authority to operate 
                certification, including recommendations by the 
                Director of National Intelligence for increased pay and 
                other incentives to recruit and retain such personnel.

                across the elements of the intelligence community with 
                respect to the protocol under paragraph (1), including 
                a requirement for--
                            (i) the Director of National Intelligence 
                        to designate an official to lead such 
                        coordination across the intelligence community; 
                        and
                            (ii) the head of each element of the 
                        intelligence community to designate an official 
                        of the element to oversee the implementation of 
                        such protocol with respect to the element.

        Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense 
        may jointly establish nonuniform documentation requirements for 
        commercial providers submitting applications for authority to 
        operate certifications, in addition to the requirements 
        specified in paragraph (2)(D), only if, prior to such 
        establishment, the Director and Secretary provide to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a briefing on why such 
        additional requirements are necessary.
            (4) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) The term ``appropriate congressional 
                committees'' means--
                            (i) the congressional intelligence

    (c) Plan to Expand Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility 
Access by Certain Contractors.--
            (1) Plan; briefing.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National 
        Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with 
        the heads of such other elements of the intelligence community 
        as the Director of National Intelligence may determine 
        appropriate, shall jointly--
                    (A) develop a plan to expand access by covered 
                contractors to sensitive compartmented information 
                facilities for the purpose of providing covered 
                contractors with a facility to securely perform work 
                under covered contracts; and
                    (B) provide to the appropriate congressional 
                committees a briefing on such plan.
            (2) Matters.--The plan under paragraph (1) shall include 
        the following:
                    (A) An overview of the existing sensitive 
                compartmented information facilities, if any, that may 
                be repurposed for the purpose specified in paragraph 
                (1).
                    (B) An assessment of the feasibility of building 
                additional sensitive compartmented information 
                facilities for such purpose.
                    (C) An assessment of the relative costs and 
                benefits of repurposing existing, or building 
                additional, sensitive compartmented information 
                facilities for such purpose.
                    (D) The eligibility criteria for determining which 
                covered contractors may be granted access to sensitive 
                compartmented information facilities for such purpose.
                    (E) An estimate of the maximum number of covered 
                contractors that may be provided access to sensitive 
                compartmented information facilities for such purpose, 
                taking into account the matters specified in 
                subparagraphs (A) and (B).
                    (F) Policies to ensure the efficient and narrow use 
                of sensitive compartmented information facilities for 
                such purpose, including a timeline for the length of 
                such use by a covered contractor and a detailed 
                description of the process to terminate access to the 
                sensitive compartmented information facility by a 
                covered contractor upon--
                            (i) the expiration of the covered contract 
                        of the covered contractor; or
                            (ii) a determination that the covered 
                        contractor no longer has a need for such access 
                        to fulfill the terms of such contract.
                    (G) Pricing structures for the use of sensitive 
                compartmented information facilities by covered 
                contractors for the purpose specified in paragraph (1). 
                Such pricing structures--
                            (i) may include free use (for the purpose 
                        of incentivizing future covered contracts), 
                        with the potential for pricing to increase 
                        dependent on the length of the covered 
                        contract, the size of the covered contractor, 
                        and the need for such use; and
                            (ii) shall ensure that the cumulative cost 
                        for a covered contractor to rent and 
                        independently certify a sensitive compartmented 
                        information facility for such purpose does not 
                        exceed the market average for the Director of 
                        National Intelligence or the Secretary of 
                        Defense to build, certify, and maintain a 
                        sensitive compartmented information facility.
                    (H) A security plan for vetting each covered 
                contractor prior to the access of a sensitive 
                compartmented information facility by the covered 
                contractor for the purpose specified in paragraph (1), 
                and an assessment of potential security concerns 
                regarding such access.
                    (I) A proposed timeline for the expansion of access 
                to sensitive compartmented information facilities in 
                accordance with paragraph (1).
                    (J) Such other matters as the Director of National 
                Intelligence or the Secretary of Defense considers 
                relevant to such expansion.
            (3) Eligibility criteria for covered contractors.--Under 
        the eligibility criteria specified in subparagraph (D)--
                    (A) unless the Director of National Intelligence 
                determines the source of the financing of a covered 
                contractor poses a national security risk, such source 
                of financing may not be taken into consideration in 
                making a determination as to the eligibility of the 
                covered contractor; and
                    (B) preference shall be given to any preferred 
                contractor described in paragraph (4).
            (4) Preferred contractors.--A preferred contractor 
        described in this paragraph is a covered contractor--

                covered contract and demonstrates a need for access to 
                a sensitive compartmented information facility with 
                respect to such ongoing project; or
                    (B) the covered contract of which is a contract

                Force (or such successor program), the Director of the 
                Defense Innovation Unit of the Department of Defense, 
                or the head of any other program or element of the 
                Federal Government with a focus on technology or 
                innovation.

SEC. 515. COMPLIANCE BY THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WITH REQUIREMENTS OF 
              THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION RELATING TO 
              COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE OFF-THE-SHELF ITEMS AND COMMERCIAL 
              SERVICES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) parts 10 and 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
        broadly require departments and agencies of the United States 
        Government to conduct market research to determine whether 
        commercially available off-the-shelf items, nondevelopmental 
        items, or commercial services are available that could meet the 
        requirements of the department or agency;
            (2) the requirements under such parts 10 and 12, among 
        other important goals, reduce administrative costs and allow 
        expedited acquisition and deployment of such items and 
        services;
            (3) however, such departments and agencies too often 
        contract for custom products, rather than buying existing 
        commercial products and adapting those as necessary, which 
        creates a fundamental compliance issue; and
            (4) the intelligence community should adopt a culture shift 
        to ensure better compliance with such parts 10 and 12.
    (b) Policy.--
            (1) Requirement.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director of National 
        Intelligence shall implement a policy to ensure that each 
        element of the intelligence community complies with parts 10 
        and 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation with respect to 
        any procurement.
            (2) Elements.--The policy under paragraph (1) shall include 
        the following:
                    (A) Written criteria for an element of the 
                intelligence community to evaluate when a procurement 
                of a covered item or service is permissible, 
                including--
                            (i) requiring the element to conduct an 
                        independent market analysis to determine 
                        whether a commercially available off-the-shelf 
                        item, nondevelopmental item, or commercial 
                        service is viable; and
                            (ii) a description of the offeror for such 
                        covered item or service and how the covered 
                        item or service to be acquired will be 
                        integrated into existing systems of the 
                        intelligence community.
                    (B) If an element of the intelligence community 
                enters into a contract for artificial intelligence or 
                other emerging technologies that is a covered item or 
                service, not later than 45 days before entering into 
                such contract, the head of the element shall notify the 
                congressional intelligence committees in writing of the 
                intent to enter into such contract, including a brief 
                summary of--
                            (i) the justification for not using a 
                        commercially available off-the-shelf item, 
                        nondevelopmental item, or commercial service; 
                        and
                            (ii) the independent market analysis 
                        conducted under subparagraph (A).
                    (C) A detailed set of performance incentives for 
                the acquisition personnel of the intelligence community 
                that--
                            (i) prioritizes and rewards adherence to 
                        parts 10 and 12 of the Federal Acquisition 
                        Regulation; and
                            (ii) incentivizes reliance by the 
                        intelligence community on commercially 
                        available off-the-shelf items, nondevelopmental 
                        items, or commercial services and incentivizes 
                        such personnel that enter into contracts for 
                        covered items or services only when necessary.
                    (D) Methods to ensure the coordination across the 
                elements of the intelligence community in carrying out 
                the policy, including by designating an official of 
                each element to ensure implementation and incentives 
                for elements to share best practices for entering into 
                contracts for covered items or services.
                    (E) On an annual basis, the head of each element of 
                the intelligence community shall certify in writing to 
                the congressional intelligence committees that each 
                contract involving software development that was 
                awarded during the year covered by the certification 
                was awarded in adherence to section 3453 of title 10, 
                United States Code, and such parts 10 and 12, as 
                applicable.
                    (F) Any other incentives for the acquisition 
                personnel of the intelligence community that the 
                Director determines appropriate to improve the use of 
                commercially available off-the-shelf items, 
                nondevelopmental items, and commercial services in 
                contracts for emerging technologies, including with 
                respect to pay incentives, time off for training, and 
                nonmonetary awards.
            (3) Submission.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director of National 
        Intelligence shall submit to the congressional intelligence

        States Code.
            (2) Covered item or service.--The term ``covered item or 
        service'' means a product, system, or service that is not a 
        commercially available off-the-shelf item, a commercial 
        service, or a nondevelopmental item.

SEC. 516. POLICY ON REQUIRED USER ADOPTION METRICS IN CERTAIN CONTRACTS 
              FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is critical that the intelligence community acquire 
        products that can be integrated, to the highest extent 
        possible, within existing workflows and personnel capabilities;
            (2) one step toward that goal is ensuring that products 
        procured by the intelligence community have user-adoption 
        metrics, which allow programmers and vendors to assess the 
        effectiveness of a given product to an intelligence community 
        user;
            (3) requiring such metrics also incentivizes vendors to 
        incorporate training and adoption programs into their products, 
        as opposed to contracts which simply sell an application to the 
        intelligence community with no customer success feature built 
        in; and
            (4) in addition, this data is critical to informing 
        decisions about the continued use of a product, including 
        relating to whether a prototype will transition from 
        development to an enterprise-wide contract or program of 
        record.
    (b) Policy.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall 
establish a policy containing the following:
            (1) With respect to a contract or other agreement entered 
        into between the head of an element of the intelligence 
        community and a commercial provider for the acquisition of a 
        covered product for users within the intelligence community--
                    (A) a requirement that each such contract or other 
                agreement include, as a term of the contract or 
                agreement, a commitment by the commercial provider to 
                furnish a means of collecting user adoption metrics for 
                assessing the adoption of the covered product by such 
                users; and
                    (B) a requirement that the head assess the user 
                adoption of the covered product through such means.
            (2) Such exceptions to the requirements under paragraph (1) 
        as may be determined appropriate by the Director.
    (c) Reports.--
            (1) Submission.--Not later than 1 year after the date on 
        which the Director of National Intelligence establishes the 
        policy under subsection (b), and annually thereafter for 3 
        years, the Director, in coordination with the heads of the 
        elements of the intelligence community, shall submit to the 
        congressional intelligence committees a report on the user 
        adoption metrics for each covered product acquired using, in 
        whole or in part, funds made available under the National 
        Intelligence Program.
            (2) Matters.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall 
        include, with respect to the year covered by the report, the 
        following:
                    (A) A detailed description of the effectiveness of 
                the policy under subsection (b), including a cost-
                benefit analysis of such policy.
                    (B) A summary of the user adoption metrics 
                collected pursuant to such policy for each program 
                referred to in paragraph (1).
                    (C) An identification of any instance in which the 
                head of an element of the intelligence community 
                determined that requiring a commitment to furnish a 
                means of collecting user adoption metrics as a term of 
                a contract or agreement pursuant to such policy was not 
                practicable pursuant to an exception specified in 
                subsection (b)(2) and, as a result, did not require 
                such commitment.
                    (D) A justification for the continuation of the use 
                of any covered product acquired by the head of an 
                element of the intelligence community that the head has 
                determined, pursuant to an assessment required under 
                subsection (b)(1)(B), was not sufficiently adopted by 
                users or otherwise received negative user feedback.
                    (E) Any other matters, including any relevant 
                recommendations, determined appropriate by the 
                Director.
            (3) Timing.--Each report under paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted prior to the date of the presentation of the 
        consolidated National Intelligence Program budget for the year 
        covered by the report to the President for approval pursuant to 
        section 102A(c) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 
        3024).
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Covered product.--The term ``covered product'' means a 
        commercial software product that involves artificial 
        intelligence.
            (2) National intelligence program.--The term ``National 
        Intelligence Program'' has the meaning given that term in 
        section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 
        3003).

SEC. 517. ASSESSMENTS RELATING TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND SOFTWARE 
              SYSTEMS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the intelligence community continues to rely heavily on 
        legacy information technology systems and software;
            (2) transitioning these systems as appropriate to modern 
        software as a service, cloud-based, and open-source systems is 
        a priority;
            (3) in many instances, there are no incentives to make such 
        a transition due to the cost, complexity, administrative 
        hurdles, and user adoption challenges with any such transition; 
        and
            (4) therefore, it is imperative for the intelligence 
        community to create incentives to ensure that its systems 
        evolve with industry and remain competitive with foreign 
        adversaries of the United States.
    (b) Assessments Required.--
            (1) Intelligence community-wide baseline assessment.--Not 
        later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
        the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the 
        heads of the elements of the intelligence community, shall 
        complete an assessment of the information technology and 
        software systems of each element of the intelligence community, 
        to review whether such systems integrate new and emerging 
        technology and, as appropriate, make recommendations to 
        decommission or replace outdated systems. Such assessment shall 
        include, with respect to each such system, an evaluation of the 
        following:
                    (A) The usability of the system.
                    (B) Whether the system is the most up-to-date 
                version of the system available.
                    (C) The compatibility of the system with new and 
                emerging technology.
                    (D) The costs and benefits of using an alternative 
                system in lieu of the system, including the financial 
                cost of transitioning to such an alternative system and 
                any technical or administrative barriers to such 
                transition.
                    (E) Such other matters as may be determined 
                appropriate by the Director.
            (2) Assessments upon entry into, renewal, or extension of 
        certain contracts.--Not later than 60 days after the date on 
        which the head of an element of the intelligence community 
        enters into, renews, or extends a contract for the acquisition 
        of an information technology or software system, the Director 
        of National Intelligence shall conduct an assessment of such 
        system in accordance with paragraph (1), including by 
        evaluating each of the matters specified in subparagraphs (A) 
        through (E) of such paragraph, with respect to such system.
    (c) Guidance.--The Director shall issue to the heads of the 
elements of the intelligence community guidance to--
            (1) incentivize each such head to adopt and integrate new 
        and emerging technology within information technology and 
        software systems of the element and to decommission and replace 
        outdated systems, including through potential funding 
        enhancements; and
            (2) incentivize, and hold accountable, personnel of the 
        intelligence community with respect to the integration of new 
        and emerging technology within such systems, including through 
        the provision of appropriate training programs and evaluations.
    (d) Submissions to Congress.--
            (1) Report on assessment results.--Not later than 60 days 
        after the date on which the Director completes the assessment 
        under subsection (b)(1), the Director shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report containing the 
        results of such assessment.
            (2) Submission of guidance.--Not later than 60 days after 
        the date on which the Director issues the guidance under 
        subsection (c), the Director shall submit to the appropriate 
        congressional committees a copy of such guidance.
    (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the congressional intelligence committees; and
            (2) the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate.

                          Subtitle C--Reports

SEC. 521. REPORTS ON INTEGRATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WITHIN 
              INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies 
        must be incorporated into the intelligence community at a pace 
        that matches industry and is competitive with United States 
        adversaries;
            (2) while collaboration can and does occur in instances, 
        Congress is concerned that the United States is not integrated 
        enough across disciplines to further this essential mission; 
        and
            (3) while each intelligence community element is pursuing 
        artificial intelligence adoption by either establishing new 
        offices or surging resources to existing offices, there is not 
        a single office or official at each intelligence community 
        element that has the authority to oversee artificial 
        intelligence adoption at the agency, and can serve as the 
        coordinator for interagency cooperation.
    (b) Report by Director of National Intelligence.--Not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of 
National Intelligence, in coordination with the heads of the elements 
of the intelligence community, shall submit to the congressional 
intelligence committees a report on the efforts of the intelligence 
community to develop, acquire, adopt, and maintain artificial 
intelligence across the intelligence community to improve intelligence 
collection across the collection spectrum and optimize internal work 
flows. Such report shall contain a separate review of each such element 
that includes, with respect to the element, the following:
            (1) A description of the authorities of the element 
        relating to the use of artificial intelligence, and whether the 
        element lacks any resources or authorities necessary to 
        accelerate the adoption by the element of artificial 
        intelligence solutions, including commercial products involving 
        artificial intelligence.
            (2) A description of the organizational roles, 
        responsibilities, and authorities for any senior officials of 
        the element charged with accelerating the adoption by the 
        element of artificial intelligence solutions, and whether the 
        head of the element lacks any resources or authorities to hire 
        the personnel necessary to so accelerate the adoption.
            (3) An identification of the senior official of the element 
        responsible for overseeing and coordinating efforts relating to 
        artificial intelligence across the intelligence community, 
        including through the integration of the acquisition, 
        technology, human capital, and financial management aspects 
        necessary for the adoption of artificial intelligence 
        solutions.
            (4) An assessment, conducted by the Inspector General of 
        the Intelligence Community, of the efforts of the head of the 
        element to acquire and adopt commercial products involving 
        artificial intelligence and in particular, the efforts of such 
        head to acquire and adopt such products in a timely manner.
            (5) An assessment, conducted by the Inspector General of 
        the Intelligence Community, of any administrative or technical 
        barriers to the accelerated adoption of artificial intelligence 
        by the element, including any such barriers to the efforts 
        specified in paragraph (4). Such assessment shall be 
        disaggregated by, and include input from, organizational units 
        of the element that focus on the following:
                    (A) Acquisitions and contracting.
                    (B) Personnel and workforce matters.
                    (C) Financial management and budgeting.
                    (D) Operations and capabilities.
            (6) An assessment, conducted by the Inspector General of 
        the Intelligence Community, of the efforts of the head of the 
        element to coordinate across the intelligence community for the 
        purpose of ensuring the adoption of best practices, sharing of 
        information, and efficient use of resources relating to 
        artificial intelligence, including an identification by such 
        head of any administrative or technical barriers to such 
        coordination, and recommendations for improving such 
        coordination. With respect to the review of the Office of the 
        Director of National Intelligence, such assessment shall also 
        include a specific assessment of how the Director of National 
        Intelligence, in consultation with the Director of Science and 
        Technology and the Chief Data Officer, oversees, or plans to 
        oversee, such coordination.

        for critical fields in the intelligence community is essential 
        to accelerating the incorporation, integration, and maintenance 
        of emerging technologies into the workflows and business 
        practices of the intelligence community;
            (2) Congress is concerned that the intelligence community 
        has not yet conducted a baseline assessment of what talent 
        currently exists within the intelligence community, and where 
        gaps prevent the intelligence community from meeting the 
        technology demands in the next decade;
            (3) Congress is aware that the Director of National 
        Intelligence is starting the process to lead a needs assessment 
        across the intelligence community and encourages all elements 
        of the intelligence community to work expeditiously with the 
        Director to develop that detailed assessment; and
            (4) this type of needs assessment should be 
        institutionalized and built into the future human capital 
        strategy for the next generation of intelligence officers and 
        officials.
    (b) Requirements.--The Director of National Intelligence, in

                integration, maintenance, or use of artificial 
                intelligence (and the retention and training of 
                personnel serving in such positions);
                    (B) develop a plan for--
                            (i) the review and evaluation, on a 
                        continuous basis, of the expertise necessary to 
                        accelerate the adoption of artificial 
                        intelligence and other emerging technology 
                        solutions; and
                            (ii) the update of efforts to recruit and 
                        retain personnel with such expertise; and
                    (C) coordinate and share information and best 
                practices relating to such recruitment and retention 
                within the element and across the intelligence 
                community.

                       Subtitle D--Other Matters

SEC. 531. IMPROVEMENTS TO USE OF COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) systems integration is a critical part of incorporating 
        emerging technologies into the intelligence community;
            (2) unfortunately, Congress understands that there remains 
        an uneven approach across the intelligence community for 
        contracting and executing system integration;
            (3) such disparate policies lead to added administrative 
        costs for both the intelligence community and commercial 
        vendors, and inhibit integration and operationalization in a 
        coordinated, efficient way;
            (4) further, as a result of a lack of a cohesive policy, 
        some contracts do not always adhere to the best practices of 
        commercial software as a service product, or are executed by 
        legacy contractors who create added expenses and sustainment 
        costs, among other issues; and
            (5) including standardized terms across intelligence 
        community contracts can help reduce administrative and 
        technical barriers to systems integration, make such 
        integration more efficient and effective, and ensure that each 
        contract comports with best practices and standard commercial 
        software as a service feature.
    (b) Procurement of Commercial Software Products.--

        Director of National Intelligence an intelligence community-
        wide policy to ensure that the procurement of commercial 
        software products by the intelligence community is carried out 
        in accordance with best practices.
            (2) Elements.--The policy under paragraph (1) shall include 
        the following:
                    (A) Guidelines for the heads of the elements of the 
                intelligence community to determine which contracts for 
                commercial software products are covered by the policy, 
                including with respect to agreements, authorizations to 
                operate, and other acquisition activities.
                    (B) Guidelines for using standardized terms in such 
                contracts, modeled after commercial best practices, 
                including common procedures and language regarding--
                            (i) terms for who is responsible for system 
                        integration under the contract;
                            (ii) a timeline required for system 
                        integration;
                            (iii) a mechanism included in each contract 
                        to ensure the ability of the vendor to provide 
                        continuous updates and version control for the 
                        software;
                            (iv) a mechanism included in each contract 
                        that allows the United States Government to 
                        receive and use the latest updates for the 
                        software and receive such updates in near real-
                        time;
                            (v) automatic technological mechanisms for 
                        security and data validation, including 
                        security protocols that are predicated on 
                        commercial best practices; and
                            (vi) procedures to provide incentives, and 
                        a technical framework, for system integration 
                        for new commercial software solutions to fit 
                        within existing workflows and information 
                        technology infrastructure.
                    (C) Guidelines to ensure coordination of the policy 
                throughout the intelligence community, including 
                identifying the officials in each element of the 
                intelligence who are responsible for enforcing the 
                policy.
            (3) Report.--Not later than January 1, 2025, and annually 
        thereafter, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit

            (1) Intelligence community assessment.--The Director of 
        National Intelligence, acting through the National Intelligence 
        Council, shall produce an intelligence community assessment 
        that contains--

                    (B) an identification of any opportunities to hold 
                such gray zone assets at risk, as a method of 
                influencing the behavior of Russia; and

                    (C) The likelihood that holding the gray zone asset 
                at risk will influence the behavior of Russia.
                    (D) The likelihood that holding the gray asset at 
                risk, or degrading the asset, will affect any attempt 
                of Russia to use force to change existing borders or 
                undermine the political independence or territorial 
                integrity of any state, including Ukraine.

                 Subtitle B--Reports and Other Matters

SEC. 611. REPORT ON ASSESSING WILL TO FIGHT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a study by the RAND corporation, ``will to 
        fight'' is poorly analyzed and the least understood aspect of 
        war.
            (2) In testimony before the Select Committee on 
        Intelligence of the Senate in May 2022, top intelligence 
        officials of the United States indicated that although the 
        intelligence community accurately anticipated Russia's invasion 
        of Ukraine, the intelligence community did not accurately 
        assess the will of Ukrainian forces to fight in opposition to a 
        Russian invasion or that the Ukrainian forces would succeed in 
        averting a rapid Russian military occupation of Kyiv.
            (3) According to the RAND corporation, the intelligence 
        community estimated that the Afghan government's forces could 
        hold out against the Taliban for as long as 2 years if all 
        ground forces of the United States were withdrawn. This 
        estimate was revised in June 2021 to reflect an intelligence 
        community view that Afghanistan's military collapse could come 
        in 6 to 12 months. In August 2021, the Afghan government fell 
        within days after the ground forces of the United States were 
        withdrawn.
            (4) Similarly, the rapid advance of the Islamic State in 
        Iraq and Syria and near-total collapse of the Iraqi Security 
        Forces in 2014 appeared to take the policymakers of the United 
        States by surprise.
            (5) The apparent gaps in these analyses had important 
        implications for policy decisions of the United States toward 
        Russia and Afghanistan, and suggest a need for further 
        examination of how the intelligence community assesses a 
        foreign military's will to fight.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence, acting 
through the National Intelligence Council, and in coordination with the 
heads of the elements of the intelligence community that the Director 
determines appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate congressional 
committees a report examining the extent to which analyses of the 
military will to fight and the national will to fight informed the all-
source analyses of the intelligence community regarding how the armed 
forces and governments of Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iraq would perform 
at key junctures.
    (c) Elements.--The report under subsection (b) shall include the 
following:
            (1) The methodology of the intelligence community for 
        measuring the military will to fight and the national will to 
        fight of a foreign country.
            (2) The extent to which analysts of the intelligence 
        community applied such methodology when assessing the military 
        will to fight and the national will to fight of--
                    (A) Afghanistan following the April 2021 
                announcement of the full withdrawal of the United 
                States Armed Forces;
                    (B) Iraq in the face of the rapid emergence and 
                advancement in 2014 of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria; 
                and
                    (C) Ukraine and Russia during the initial phase of 
                the invasion and march toward Kyiv by Russia in 
                February 2022.

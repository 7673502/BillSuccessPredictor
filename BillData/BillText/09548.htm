                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to 
 make certain determinations in enforcing the Jones Act, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Close Agency Loopholes to the Jones 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1920, Congress enacted the Merchant Marine Act 
        (chapters 121 and 551 of title 46, United States Code), 
        commonly referred to as the ``Jones Act''.
            (2) In 1953, Congress enacted the Outer Continental Shelf 
        Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) applying the Constitution, 
        laws, and civil and political jurisdiction of the United States 
        to the outer Continental Shelf.
            (3) In 2020, Congress enacted section 9503 of the William 
        M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) affirming that 
        application of the Constitution, laws, and civil and political 
        jurisdiction of the United States to the outer Continental 
        Shelf also applies to non-mineral energy resources and 
        exploring for, developing, producing, transporting, or 
        transmitting such resources.
            (4) Therefore, the Jones Act prohibits the use of a non-
        Jones Act qualified vessel for the provision of any coastwise 
        transportation of merchandise to or from a port of the United 
        States (including territories or possessions to which the 
        coastwise laws apply) to any point on the outer Continental 
        Shelf, or between any two points on the outer Continental 
        Shelf.
            (5) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (hereinafter 
        referred to as ``CBP'') is responsible for interpreting and 
        enforcing the Jones Act. CBP has issued ruling letters and 
        other interpretative guidance to requesting parties that 
        provide the description of proposed activities.
            (6) Unlike most federal agencies, CBP is required by 
        section 625(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1625(c)) to 
        follow its past interpretive guidance and treatments of 
        ``substantially identical transactions,'' unless it institutes 
        a public notice and comment process to modify or revoke that 
        interpretative guidance. As a result, CBP and market 
        participants treat as binding ruling letters and interpretative 
        guidance in addressing whether and how the Jones Act applies in 
        substantially identical factual situations.
            (7) Thus, CBP's ruling letters--even if legally incorrect--
        have substantial impacts: When CBP purports to authorize a 
        foreign vessel to transport merchandise between coastwise 
        points, unless ordered by a Federal court to rescind such 
        ruling letters, CBP does not take enforcement action against 
        other foreign vessels engaging in substantially identical 
        transactions, and vessel operators accordingly rely on CBP's 
        past ruling letters and guidance issued to other parties.
            (8) Over several decades, CBP has purported to create an 
        array of exemptions from the prohibitions of the Jones Act for 
        the benefit of foreign vessels.
            (9) On December 11, 2019, CBP published Customs Bulletin 
        and Decisions, Vol. 53, No. 45 (hereinafter referred to as the 
        ``2019 Decision'') revoking a handful of its interpretations, 
        recognizing that the analyses employed therein were 
        inconsistent with the Jones Act and original congressional 
        intent, including by using statutory language ``out of 
        context,'' having been superseded by amendments, or being 
        predicated on CBP-created distinctions that had always been 
        ``irrelevant'' under the Jones Act.
            (10) However, the 2019 Decision still left in force many 
        ruling letters inconsistent with the Jones Act and original 
        congressional intent, espousing the same unlawful doctrines, 
        revoked others that properly interpreted the Jones Act, and 
        created several new loopholes that purport to immunize much of 
        the same foreign vessel activities that are now, and have 
        always been, prohibited under the Jones Act.
            (11) Thus, CBP has created invalid exemptions from the 
        prohibition embodied in the Jones Act, using a variety of new 
        and old doctrines inconsistent with original congressional 
        intent. In 2014, the Supreme Court of the United States found 
        in Utility Air Regulatory Group. v. Environmental Protection 
        Agency (573 U.S. 302, 328) that it is a ``core administrative 
        law principle that an agency may not rewrite clear statutory 
        terms to suit its own sense of how the statute should 
        operate''.
            (12) These invalid, ultra vires doctrines, and their uses, 
        include--
                    (A) an unlawfully broad interpretation of ``vessel 
                equipment'' which conflicts with Congress' statutory 
                description of ``merchandise,'' and the explicit, 
                limited statutory exemption;
                    (B) the ``paid out not unladen'' doctrine, which 
                provides that pipe or cable laying operations are not 
                coastwise trade subject to the Jones Act--even when the 
                pipe is laid between two coastwise points, and in spite 
                of Congress' statutory prohibition against foreign 
                vessels performing ``any part of the transportation by 
                water'' of merchandise;
                    (C) the ``paid out not unladen'' doctrine is also 
                used by foreign vessel operators to justify the 
                transportation of merchandise attached to the paid out 
                pipe or cable;
                    (D) the ``lifting operations'' exemption, which 
                purports to permit self-propelled movements by a vessel 
                when using a crane or like equipment to install or 
                remove merchandise on or from offshore facilities or 
                subsea infrastructure;
                    (E) the ``decommissioning activity'' exemption, 
                which purports that merchandise transported as a result 
                of decommissioning--i.e., the restoration of the sea-
                floor and the water surface by plugging and abandoning 
                the well and removing the installation and facility--is 
                not subject to the Jones Act;
                    (F) the ``offshore research vessel'' 
                misapplications, which improperly extends the exclusion 
                for oceanographic or limnological research vessels to 
                commercial research activities that directly support 
                the exploration for, or development, production, 
                transportation, or transmission of, resources, on the 
                outer Continental Shelf; and
                    (G) the ``pristine seabed'' exemption, where CBP 
                has purported to hold that Outer Continental Shelf 
                Lands Act's explicit application to the ``subsoil and 
                seabed'' of the outer Continental Shelf does not 
                include the ``pristine seabed''.
            (13) If a ruling letter is contrary to the statute's plain 
        text and the expressed intent of Congress, or found 
        unpersuasive by a Federal court, it will be invalidated as 
        arbitrary and capricious.
            (14) Federal courts have not squarely addressed the 
        interpretations contained in these CBP ruling letters and other 
        guidance, and thus have never upheld these interpretations as 
        valid and authoritative.

SEC. 3. PRECLUDING EXEMPTIONS FROM JONES ACT REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN 
              FOREIGN VESSELS.

    The Secretary may not provide any exemption from the requirements 
of chapters 121 and 551 of title 46, United States Code (commonly 
referred to as the ``Jones Act''), to the owner of a foreign vessel 
engaging in commercial transportation services to directly support the 
exploration for, or development, production, transportation, or 
transmission of, resources, including non-mineral energy resources, 
from a planning or leasing area designated by the Secretary of the 
Interior under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et 
seq.).

SEC. 4. OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH VESSELS.

    (a) In General.--In enforcing chapter 551 of title 46, United 
States Code, the Secretary may not determine that a vessel engaging in

resources, including non-mineral energy resources, from a planning or 
leasing area designated by the Secretary of the Interior under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) is not 
engaged in trade or commerce under such chapter.
    (b) Oceanographic Research Vessel Clarification.--Section 50503 of 
title 46, United States Code is amended by inserting ``, except that 
any vessel engaging in commercial research activities to directly 
support the exploration for, or development, production, 
transportation, or transmission of, resources, including non-mineral 
energy resources, from a planning or leasing area designated by the 
Secretary of the Interior under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act 
(43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) may be determined to be engaged in trade or 
commerce under this section'' after ``trade or commerce''.
    (c) Designation.--The Commandant of the Coast Guard shall deny any 
request from a foreign vessel to be designated as an oceanographic 
research vessel for any such vessel engaging in commercial research 
activities to directly support the exploration for, or development, 
production, transportation, or transmission of, resources, including 
non-mineral energy resources, from a planning or leasing area 
designated by the Secretary of the Interior under the Outer Continental 
Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.).
    (d) Revocation or Modification of Certain Ruling Letters.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall revoke or modify, as

                identical to the transactions described in this 
                paragraph.
            (3) Reinstatement of certain ruling letters.--Upon revoking

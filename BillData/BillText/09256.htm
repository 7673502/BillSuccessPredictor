                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, 
to make improvements relating to cooperation between the United States 
 and Israel to counter unmanned aerial systems, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``U.S.-Israel Anti-Killer Drone Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO UNITED STATES-ISRAEL COOPERATION TO 
              COUNTER UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The growing arsenal of unmanned aerial systems of Iran 
        includes--
                    (A) unmanned aerial systems that engage in 
                intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance;
                    (B) unmanned combat aerial systems capable of 
                striking battlefield targets; and
                    (C) loitering munitions, also known as ``suicide 
                drones'' or ``kamikaze drones''.
            (2) Iran-origin unmanned aerial systems represent a threat 
        to the Armed Forces and facilities of the United States in the 
        Middle East, as well as to United States allies and partners 
        such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
            (3) In February 2018, Iran allegedly launched an armed 
        unmanned aerial system from Syria into Israeli airspace which 
        was ultimately destroyed by Israeli warplanes.
            (4) In September 2019, Iran launched cruise missiles and 
        loitering munitions at key oil installations in Saudi Arabia.
            (5) Throughout the takeover of Yemen by the Houthi, 
        beginning in 2014 and continuing into the present, the Islamic 
        Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds-Force has provided the Yemeni 
        rebels with unmanned aerial systems, enabling the Houthis to 
        routinely strike civilian targets in both Saudi Arabia and the 
        United Arab Emirates.
            (6) In March 2021, Iran attempted to send two triangular-
        shaped unmanned aerial systems towards Israel which were 
        ultimately downed by Israeli warplanes over the territory of an 
        undisclosed Arab country.
            (7) On March 27 and 28, 2022, Secretary of State Blinken 
        met in Israel with counterparts from the governments of Israel, 
        Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Morocco to 
        promote normalization in the region and declared, ``Our 
        commitment to the core principle that Iran can never acquire a 
        nuclear weapon is unwavering. One way or another, we will 
        continue to cooperate closely.''.
            (8) On June 2, 2022, Iran-backed Hezbollah sent three 
        unmanned aerial systems towards the Israeli-controlled Karish 
        gas field, one of which was intercepted by an F-16 fighter jet, 
        and two of which were intercepted by Barak 8 missiles launched 
        from the Sa'ar 5-class corvette ``INS Eilat''.
            (9) On 14 July 2022, the United States and Israel adopted 
        the Joint Declaration on the U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership, 
        reaffirming the unbreakable bonds between the two countries and 
        the enduring commitment of the United States to the security of 
        Israel.
            (10) On July 14, 2022, the House of Representatives passed 
        H.R. 7900, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
        Year 2023, sections 1333 and 1334 of which included language 
        to--
                    (A) extend the authority to carry out activities 
                and provide support relating to United States-Israel 
                cooperation to counter unmanned aerial systems under 
                section 1278 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
                for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92; 133 Stat. 
                1702; 22 U.S.C. 8606 note);
                    (B) include directed energy capabilities as a type 
                of capability for countering unmanned aerial systems 
                under such section; and
                    (C) increase the annual limitation on the amount of 
                support provided under subsection (b) of such section 
                from $25,000,000, to $40,000,000.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should--
            (1) enhance ongoing cooperation with Israel in developing 
        mutually beneficial counter unmanned aerial systems 
        technologies and capabilities;
            (2) share with Israel information about the evolving threat 
        of Iran-origin unmanned aerial systems; and
            (3) use the United States Israel Operations-Technology 
        Working Group authorized under section 1299M(c) of the National 
        Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-
        283; 134 Stat. 4014) as the epicenter of such efforts.
    (c) United States-Israel Cooperation To Counter Unmanned Aerial 
Systems.--Section 1278(a)(2) of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-92; 133 Stat. 1702; 22 U.S.C. 8606 
note) is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs:
                    ``(C) The status of cooperation between the United 
                States and Israel on countering unmanned aerial 
                systems, to include an assessment of--
                            ``(i) the development of equipment and 
                        procedures to counter unmanned aerial systems;
                            ``(ii) the capability of Israel to detect, 
                        counter, and deter unmanned aerial systems;
                            ``(iii) the cooperation between the United 
                        States and Israel to detect, counter, and deter 
                        unmanned aerial systems;
                            ``(iv) in particular, such cooperation with 
                        respect to the detection, countering, and 
                        deterrence of loitering munitions; and
                            ``(v) the extent to which the United 
                        States-Israel Operations-Technology Working 
                        Group is being used to carry out the activities 
                        described in paragraph (1).
                    ``(D) An assessment of the threat to the United 
                States and Israel posed by unmanned aerial systems from 
                Iran and associated proxies of Iran, including an 
                assessment of currently deployed or otherwise available 
                anti-drone capabilities of the United States and Israel 
                and the adequacy of such capabilities to offset such 
                threat.''.

                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a Federal program of cumulative impact assessments under 
     the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cumulative Impacts Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) All Americans, regardless of income, race, ethnicity, 
        color, national origin, gender, or sexual identity, deserve to 
        live in clean and healthy communities free from the burdens of 
        environmental pollution and degradation.
            (2) Communities of color and lower-income communities have 
        historically been subjected to disproportionate amounts of air, 
        water, and soil pollution, including pollution from numerous 
        and concentrated industrial, commercial, and governmental 
        facilities located in those communities.
            (3) As a result, residents of these overburdened 
        communities have suffered from increased adverse health risks, 
        including asthma, cancer, elevated blood lead levels, 
        respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and 
        developmental disorders. Children are most vulnerable to the 
        effects of pollution and can suffer lifelong consequences. The 
        adverse effects of pollution harm the well-being and stability 
        of these communities and their residents.
            (4) These disproportionate burdens have been the 
        consequence of policy decisions at all levels of government 
        over many years, and government now has the responsibility and 
        moral imperative to correct these injustices.
            (5) No community should bear a disproportionate share of 
        the adverse environmental and public health impacts of 
        pollution caused by economic or any other activity.
            (6) Overburdened communities should be empowered legally 
        and politically to participate in any decision to allow 
        additional facilities which by their nature increase 
        environmental and public health stressors to locate in their 
        communities.
            (7) It is in the public interest to limit the future 
        placement and expansion of such facilities in overburdened 
        communities.
            (8) The burden of proof that a proposed action will not 
        harm communities should fall on polluting industries and on the 
        Federal Government in its regulatory role, not the communities 
        themselves.
            (9) Pollutants currently regulated by the Federal 
        Government, including for example criteria air pollutants, may 
        have additive and synergistic negative effects on human health 
        and the environment when combined.
            (10) Cumulative impacts are the public health and 
        environmental risks and impacts caused by the combined past, 
        present, and reasonably foreseeable future releases of 
        environmental pollution in a specific geographic area. 
        Cumulative impact assessment considers sensitive populations 
        and other social factors that may heighten vulnerability to 
        environmental pollution and associated health risks.
            (11) Cumulative impact assessments built into permitting 
        decisions are one critical tool for preventing increased 
        environmental and public health degradation in overburdened 
        communities. At its most basic, cumulative impact assessment 
        requires studying the impacts of having multiple pollution 
        sources and stressors combined together on public health and 
        the environment. While the effects of a single pollutant from a 
        single source may be less significant when analyzed in 
        isolation, the cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants from 
        multiple sources in combination with each other and with other 
        social vulnerabilities degrade public health and the 
        environment substantially. Cumulative impact assessments should 
        be incorporated into pollution permitting decisions such that 
        Federal regulators are required to deny permits that threaten 
        public health and the environment.
            (12) The general failure of the Federal Government to 
        consider and regulate potential cumulative impacts in pollution 
        permitting decisions has resulted in the inequitable 
        distribution of pollution across regions and overburdening of 
        certain communities.
            (13) Federal Government inaction has forced some State and 
        local governments to act on their own to regulate cumulative 
        impacts, including California and New Jersey, creating a 
        patchwork of cumulative impact regulations across the country.
            (14) The Federal Government is aware of the importance of 
        cumulative impact assessment in other types of environmental 
        review, such as with environmental assessments conducted under 
        the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
        et seq.).
            (15) The Federal Government should adopt and operationalize 
        cumulative impact assessment in all pollution permitting 
        decisions, especially in overburdened communities, and should 
        deny permits that create a reasonable certainty of harm to 
        communities.

SEC. 3. CONSIDERATION OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS AND PERSISTENT VIOLATIONS 
              IN CERTAIN PERMITTING DECISIONS.

    (a) Federal Water Pollution Control Act.--Section 402 of the 
Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342) is amended--

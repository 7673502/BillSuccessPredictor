                                 A BILL


 
     To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to expand the 
 availability of medical nutrition therapy services under the Medicare 
                                program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over two-thirds of Medicare fee-for-service 
        beneficiaries have two or more chronic conditions, many of 
        which can be prevented, delayed, treated, or managed through 
        nutrition.
            (2) Individuals from many racial and ethnic minority 
        backgrounds are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic 
        diseases such as diabetes, prediabetes, chronic kidney disease, 
        end-stage renal disease, and obesity.
            (3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds 
        that individuals are at an increased risk of severe illness 
        from COVID-19 if they have cancer, chronic kidney disease, 
        diabetes, heart conditions such as health failure or coronary 
        artery disease, or obesity.
            (4) Coverage for medical nutrition therapy is only 
        available to Medicare part B beneficiaries with diabetes or a 
        renal disease, despite medical nutrition therapy being part of 
        the standard of care, in clinical guidelines, and medically 
        necessary for many more chronic conditions.
            (5) Medical nutrition therapy has been shown to be a cost-
        effective component of treatment for obesity, diabetes, 
        hypertension, dyslipidemia, HIV infection, unintended weight 
        loss in older adults and other chronic conditions.

SEC. 3. EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY 
              SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

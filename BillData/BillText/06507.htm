        under subsection (a) for any taxable year, there shall be 
        allowed as a deduction under this section an amount equal to 
        the aggregate amount paid in cash by an individual during the 
        taxable year to a child savings account of a child of the 
        individual.
            ``(2) Limitation.--The amount taken into account under 
        paragraph (1) with respect to each child of an individual

        this subsection, the term `child health savings account' means 
        a health savings account designated as a child health savings 
        account and established for the benefit of a child of an 
        individual, but only if under the written governing instrument 
        creating the trust, no contribution will be accepted to the 
        extent such contribution, when added to previous contributions 
        to the trust for the calendar year, exceeds the dollar amount 
        in effect under paragraph (2).
            ``(4) Treatment of account before age of 18.--For the 
        purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided in this 
        subsection, a child health savings account shall be treated as 
        a health savings account of the parents of the child until the 
        child attained the age of 18, after which such account shall be 
        treated as a health savings account of the child.
            ``(5) Distributions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For the purposes of this

                        the account was established has attained the 
                        age of 18, shall be included in the gross 
                        income of the parents of the child, and 
                        subsection (f)(A) shall apply (relating to 
                        additional tax on distributions not used for 
                        qualified medical expenses).

                        or distributed out of such account after the 
                        child has attained the age of 18 may only be 
                        treated as used to pay qualified medical 
                        expenses to the extent such child is not 
                        covered as a dependent under insurance (other 
                        than permitted insurance) of a parent.
                    ``(B) Exceptions for disability or death of a 
                child.--If the child becomes disabled within the 
                meaning of section 72(m)(7) or dies--
                            ``(i) paragraph (1) shall not apply to any 
                        subsequent payment or distribution, and
                            ``(ii) a parent may rollover the amount in 
                        such account to an individual retirement plan 
                        of the parent, to any health savings account of 
                        the parent, or to any child health savings 
                        account of any other child of the parent.
            ``(6) Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such 
        regulations or other guidance as may be necessary or 
        appropriate to carry out the purposes of this subsection.''.

                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation 
  of the Secretary of Education, to conduct a study on the impact of 
COVID-19 on the mental health of education professionals, to direct the 
 Secretary of Education to award grants to implement or improve health 
   and wellness programs for education professionals, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Teacher and Educator Access to 
Crucial Health and Wellness Act of 2022'' or the ``TEACH Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately 
        negative impact on mental health of educators in the United 
        States, leading to an increase in stress and burnout among the 
        education workforce.
            (2) According to the National Education Association and the 
        American Federation of Teachers, rates of stress were higher 
        among teachers than most other working adults during the 
        pandemic. More than 3 in 4 teachers reported frequent job-
        related stress, compared to 40-percent of other working adults, 
        and 27-percent of teachers reported symptoms of depression, 
        compared to 10-percent of other adults.
            (3) The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated educator departure 
        and retirement, which has led to an ongoing teacher 
        recruitment, retention, and shortage crisis in the United 
        States.
            (4) The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted an increased need for 
        employee health and wellness programs in schools across the 
        country.
            (5) Employee wellness programs can help create a more 
        supportive work environment for education professionals, 
        thereby supporting educator retention.
            (6) More research is essential to understanding the impact 
        the COVID-19 pandemic had on educators' mental health, and 
        there is an immediate need to increase educators' access to 
        employee wellness programs.

SEC. 3. STUDY ON IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH OF EDUCATORS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and in 
consultation of the Secretary of Education, shall conduct a study that 
analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of education 
professionals. Such study shall specifically address--
            (1) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental 
        health of education professionals;
            (2) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall 
        staff retention of education professionals;
            (3) the barriers that remain with respect to access to 
        mental health services for education professionals; and
            (4) any policies or practices that may promote resiliency 
        among education professionals, specifically during, and in the 
        aftermath of, a high-stress event, such as the COVID-19 
        pandemic.
    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
submit to the Congress a report--
            (1) on the results of the study conducted under subsection 
        (a); and
            (2) that includes the Secretary's recommendations for best 
        practices--
                    (A) to promote the mental health of education 
                professionals, especially during, and in the aftermath 
                of, a high-stress event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; 
                and
                    (B) to prepare for future high-stress events such 
                as the COVID-19 pandemic.

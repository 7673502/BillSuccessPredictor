               warfare campaigns, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Gray Zone Defense 
Assessment Act''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is as 
follows:

Sec. 1. Short title.
Sec. 2. Findings.
Sec. 3. Sense of Congress.
Sec. 4. Statement of policy.
Sec. 5. Evaluation of national capacities for conducting gray zone 
                            operations.
Sec. 6. Report on Department of State capacity to respond to gray zone 
                            aggression.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1948, George F. Kennan observed that, ``In broadest 
        definition, political warfare is the employment of all the 
        means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its 
        national objectives.''.
            (2) Today, this coercive activity is referred to by many 
        names within the United States Government and the academic 
        community, most notably ``gray zone'' operations.
            (3) Although increasingly employed as a means of political 
        warfare, the full contours of gray zone operations remain 
        ambiguous. However, central features of gray zone operations 
        include that they are ultimately directed by state actors, 
        consist of efforts not associated with routine statecraft, and 
        are intended to advance a country's objectives at the expense 
        of a rival, without crossing a threshold that results in 
        kinetic military conflict. They include such operations and 
        tactics as the following:
                    (A) Information warfare, including conducting 
                disinformation campaigns or the spreading of 
                propaganda.
                    (B) Encouraging internal strife within target 
                countries.
                    (C) Coordinated efforts to unduly influence 
                democratic elections or related political activities.
                    (D) Economic coercion.
                    (E) Cyber operations, below the threshold of 
                conflict, aimed at coercion, espionage, or otherwise 
                undermining a target.
                    (F) Support of domestic or foreign proxy forces.
                    (G) Coercive investment and bribery for political 
                aims.
                    (H) Industrial policy designed to monopolize a 
                strategic industry or to destroy such an industry in 
                other nations, especially when coordinated with other 
                gray zone operations.
                    (I) Military, paramilitary, or similar provocations 
                and operations short of war.
                    (J) Government financing or sponsorship of 
                activities described in subparagraphs (A) through (I).
            (4) Various gray zone operations are frequently linked 
        together into a coordinated campaign, that may also include 
        tools of routine diplomacy, and that is designed to achieve a 
        state's political or military objective.
            (5) Gray zone campaigns are attractive to state actors for 
        several reasons, including reduced costs compared to the 
        deployment of conventional forces, thereby allowing states to 
        pursue their objectives with limited resources.
            (6) The People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, 
        the Islamic Republic of Iran, and other countries actively 
        advance their own strategic objectives and challenge United 
        States interests through the extensive use of gray zone 
        operations.
            (7) Unwelcome escalation by adversarial powers--especially 
        over the last decade--from routine statecraft into gray zone 
        competition is a defining feature of the recent reemergence of 
        great-power competition and requires an appropriate United 
        States response.
            (8) The United States has not sufficiently deterred or 
        responded to gray zone campaigns, thereby risking undermining 
        United States national interests, diminishing United States 
        influence and credibility, and encouraging rivals to further 
        employ such tactics.
            (9) Successfully responding to adversary gray zone 
        campaigns relies upon the full integration of instruments of 
        national power across multiple domains and the ability to 
        deploy such capacities in a coordinated, real-time campaign.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) gray zone competition is a central and enduring aspect 
        of great-power competition, and the United States should 
        elevate the effective response to adversary gray zone campaigns 
        as a central feature of its approach to great-power 
        competition;
            (2) an effective, whole-of-government approach is essential 
        to meeting the gray zone challenges posed by competitors of the 
        United States; and
            (3) since gray zone activity takes place below the 
        threshold of kinetic military conflict and since narrative 
        formation is frequently a critical aspect of gray zone 
        campaigns, the Department of State should take a preeminent 
        role in coordinating, within applicable interagency processes, 
        the disparate means of national power as the United States 
        seeks to respond to adversary gray zone campaigns.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) seek effective responses, particularly at the 
        Department of State, to adversary gray zone campaigns and to 
        recognize the paramount importance of such responses to the 
        national interests of the United States;
            (2) continue upholding the international rule of law and 
        the rules-based international order, which is a core national 
        security interest of the United States; and
            (3) call on United States allies and partners to employ 
        sufficient national resources to equitably contribute to the 
        response to gray zone challenges.

              OPERATIONS.

    (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the

                capabilities, interactive effects, and impact on United 
                States interests;

        for--
                    (A) determining which such activities or campaigns

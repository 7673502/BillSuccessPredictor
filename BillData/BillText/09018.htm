to eligible projects that--
            (1) will provide greater net impact in avoiding or reducing 
        emissions of greenhouse gases; and
            (2) are sited in a manner that minimizes environmental 
        disturbance and other siting concerns, including by being sited 
        within, or adjacent to, existing pipeline or other linear 
        infrastructure corridors.
    (e) Considerations.--In selecting eligible projects to receive a 
grant or a loan under the HIFIA pilot program, the Secretary, to the 
maximum extent practicable, shall select projects--
            (1) that are large-capacity, common carrier infrastructure;
            (2) that enable geographical diversity in associated 
        projects and supply chains to produce, use, or store hydrogen, 
        with the goal of enabling projects in all major regions of the 
        United States with current hydrogen demand and potential future 
        hydrogen demand;
            (3) that will generate the greatest benefit to low-income 
        or disadvantaged communities; and
            (4) that will--
                    (A) maximize creation or retention of jobs in the 
                United States; and
                    (B) provide the highest job quality.

        HIFIA pilot program shall be not less than the interest rate on 
        United States Treasury securities of a similar maturity to the 
        maturity of the loan on the date of closing on the loan.
            (3) Maturity date.--The final maturity date of a loan 
        provided under the HIFIA pilot program shall be the date that 
        is 30 years after the date of substantial completion of the 
        applicable eligible project.
            (4) Repayment.--
                    (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a 
                repayment schedule for each loan provided under the 
                HIFIA pilot program.
                    (B) Commencement.--Repayment of a loan provided 
                under the HIFIA pilot program shall commence on the 
                date of substantial completion of the applicable 
                eligible project for which the loan was provided.
                    (C) Deferral of repayment.--If, at any time during 
                the 5-year period beginning on the date of substantial 
                completion of an eligible project, the project is 
                unable to generate sufficient revenues in excess of 
                reasonable and necessary operating expenses to pay the 
                scheduled loan repayments of principal and interest on 
                the loan, the Secretary may allow the borrower to defer 
                repayment of the loan until the end of that 5-year 
                period.

sectors, such as power generation, transportation, aviation, storage, 
industrial, and chemicals, including hydrogen fuel''.
    (l) Technical Assistance.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary and the National 
        Laboratories may provide technical assistance under the HIFIA 
        pilot program to assess the grading and readiness of existing 
        infrastructure to transport, store, or deliver hydrogen with 
        respect to informal State and regional planning for investments 
        in that grading and readiness.
            (2) Priority.--In providing technical assistance under 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary and the National Laboratories

        hydrogen in natural gas pipelines;
            (2) if that assessment indicates that additional authority 
        is needed to support the deployment of hydrogen transportation 
        infrastructure, submit to Congress a report describing the 
        needed authority; and
            (3) identify the eligibility of, and process for, hydrogen 
        transportation infrastructure to receive cost recovery under 
        the HIFIA pilot program through Commission-regulated rates,

        appropriate, for the transportation of hydrogen in interstate 
        commerce.
    (n) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary to carry out the HIFIA pilot program

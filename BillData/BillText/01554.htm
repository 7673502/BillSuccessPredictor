                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit the use of funds for the research and development, 
  production, or deployment of the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise 
              missile and its associated nuclear warhead.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Nuclear SLCM Ban Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States nuclear arsenal comprises 
        approximately 3,800 nuclear warheads in the active stockpile 
        and a force structure of long-range and short-range delivery 
        systems, including--
                    (A) land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles;
                    (B) submarine-launched ballistic missiles that can 
                deliver both low-yield and higher-yield nuclear 
                warheads;
                    (C) long-range strategic bomber aircraft capable of 
                carrying nuclear-armed air-launched cruise missile and 
                nuclear gravity bombs; and
                    (D) short-range fighter aircraft that can deliver 
                nuclear gravity bombs.
            (2) In 2010, the United States retired the nuclear-armed 
        sea-launched cruise missile, or the TLAM-N, after concluding in 
        the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review that the capability ``serve[d] 
        a redundant purpose in the U.S. nuclear stockpile''.
            (3) Ten years later, in 2020, the United States initiated 
        studies into a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile 
        and associated warhead, after concluding in the 2018 Nuclear 
        Posture Review that the weapon system would provide a ``non-
        strategic regional presence'' and ``an assured response 
        capability''.
            (4) The United States possesses an array of nuclear weapons 
        systems, including both air- and sea-based capabilities, that 
        provide an effective regional deterrent presence, making the 
        nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile a redundant, 
        unnecessary capability.
            (5) Deploying nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles on 
        attack submarines or surface ships risks detracting from the 
        core military missions of such submarines and ships, such as 
        tracking enemy submarines, protecting United States carrier 
        groups, and conducting conventional strikes on priority land 
        targets.
            (6) Stationing nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles 
        on such submarines or ships also risks complicating port visits 
        and joint operations with some allies and partners of the 
        United States, which in turn would reduce the operational 
        effectiveness of such submarines and ships and the deterrent 
        value of deployed nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles.
            (7) A January 2019 analysis of the Congressional Budget 
        Office estimated that the projected costs of the nuclear-armed 
        sea-launched cruise missile program from 2019 to 2028 would 
        total $9,000,000,000, adding additional costs and resource 
        requirements to the United States nuclear modernization program 
        and increasing pressure on the Navy budget as the service plans 
        for increases in shipbuilding while funding the Columbia-class 
        submarine program.
            (8) The cost of this new program will be larger, as this 
        estimate did not account for costs related to integrating 
        nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles on attack submarines 
        or surface ships, nuclear weapons-specific training for Navy 
        personnel, or storage and security for nuclear warheads.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 
              PRODUCTION, OR DEPLOYMENT OF NUCLEAR-ARMED SEA-LAUNCHED 
              CRUISE MISSILE AND ASSOCIATED WARHEAD.

    None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made 
available for fiscal year 2022 or any fiscal year thereafter for the 
Department of Defense or the Department of Energy may be obligated or 
expended for the research and development, production, or deployment of 
the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile and its associated 
nuclear warhead.

        State shall expend at least 5 percent of the amount the State 
        receives pursuant to section 1911 for each fiscal year to 
        support evidenced-based programs that address the crisis care 
        needs of individuals with serious mental disorders, and 
        children with serious mental and emotional disturbances.
            ``(2) Core elements.--At the discretion of the single State 
        agency responsible for the administration of the program of the 
        State under a grant under section 1911, funds expended pursuant 
        to paragraph (1) may be used to fund some or all of the core 
        crisis care service components, delivered according to 
        evidence-based principles, including the following:
                    ``(A) Crisis call centers.
                    ``(B) 24/7 mobile crisis services.
                    ``(C) Crisis stabilization programs offering acute 
                care or subacute care in a hospital or appropriately 
                licensed facility, as determined by the Substance Abuse 
                and Mental Health Services Administration, with 
                referrals to inpatient or outpatient care.
            ``(3) State flexibility.--In lieu of expending 5 percent of 
        the amount the State receives pursuant to section 1911 for a 
        fiscal year to support evidence-based programs as required by 
        paragraph (1), a State may elect to expend not less than 10 
        percent of such amount to support such programs by the end of 
        two consecutive fiscal years.''.

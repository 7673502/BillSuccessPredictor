moving party is considered to have prevailed on the special motion to

entitled to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred 
in responding to the special motion to dismiss. Such a presumption can 
be rebutted by a showing that such an award would be unreasonable or 
that special circumstances exist that would make such an award unjust, 
as determined by the court.

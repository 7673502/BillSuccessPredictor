                                 AN ACT


 
To provide guidance for and investment in the upgrade and modernization 
 of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio 
              All Hazards network, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``NOAA Weather Radio Modernization Act 
of 2021'' or ``NWR Modernization Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the Under 
Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and Administrator of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (b) NOAA Weather Radio.--The term ``NOAA Weather Radio'' means the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio All 
Hazards network.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide network of 
        transmitters that are critical to protecting life and property 
        by broadcasting weather and other hazard alerts.
            (2) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts currently reach 95 
        percent of the United States population.
            (3) NOAA Weather Radio broadcasts originate from all 
        National Weather Service Offices, but are only available via a 
        receiver located in sufficient proximity to a radio 
        transmitting tower.
            (4) There are limited options to obtain NOAA Weather Radio 
        broadcasts via the Internet or mobile device application, which 
        are provided by volunteer mechanisms obtaining the audio feed 
        in an ad hoc manner.
            (5) NOAA Weather Radio should provide equal access and 
        availability to unimpeded broadcasts of weather and non-weather 
        hazards to every person located within the United States, its 
        territories, and tribal lands.

SEC. 4. UPGRADING EXISTING SYSTEMS.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator shall, to the maximum extent 
practicable, expand coverage of the NOAA Weather Radio and ensure its 
reliability. In doing so, the Administrator shall--
            (1) maintain support for existing systems serving areas not 
        covered by or having poor quality cellular service;
            (2) ensure consistent maintenance and operations 
        monitoring, with timely repairs to broadcast transmitter site 
        equipment and antennas; and
            (3) enhance the ability to amplify Non-Weather Emergency 
        Messages via NOAA Weather Radio as necessary.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $20,000,000 to remain available 
until expended.
    (c) Expanding Access.--As part of the activities in this section, 
the Administrator shall acquire additional transmitters as required to 
expand coverage to rural and underserved communities, national parks, 
and recreation areas.

SEC. 5. MODERNIZATION INITIATIVE.

    (a) In General.--In parallel to the activities under section 4, the 
Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, enhance NOAA 
Weather Radio to ensure its capabilities and coverage remain valuable 
to the public. In carrying out these activities, the Administrator 
shall--
            (1) upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure to 
        accelerate the transition of broadcasts to Internet Protocol-
        based communications over non-copper media;
            (2) accelerate software upgrades to the Advanced Weather 
        Interactive Processing System, or the relevant system 
        successors, in order to implement partial county notifications 
        and alerts;
            (3) consult with relevant stakeholders, including the 
        private sector, to enhance accessibility and usability of NOAA 
        Weather Radio data and feeds;
            (4) develop options, including, but not limited to, 
        satellite backup capability and commercial provider 
        partnerships for NOAA Weather Radio continuity in the event of 
        Weather Forecast Office outages;
            (5) research and develop alternative options, including, 
        but not limited to, microwave capabilities, to transmit NOAA 
        Weather Radio signals to transmitters that are remote or do not 
        have IP capability; and
            (6) transition critical applications to the Integrated 
        Dissemination Program, or the relevant program successors.
    (b) Priority.--In carrying out the objectives described in 
subsection (a), the Administrator shall prioritize practices, 
capabilities, and technologies recommended by the assessment in 
subsection (c), to maximize accessibility, particularly in remote and 
underserved areas of the country.
    (c) Assessment for Management and Distribution.--Not later than 12 
months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall 
complete an assessment of access to NOAA Weather Radio. In conducting 
such an assessment, the Administrator shall take into consideration and 
provide recommendations on--
            (1) the need for continuous, adequate, and operational 
        real-time broadcasts of the NOAA Weather Radio in both urban 
        and rural areas;
            (2) solicited inputs from relevant stakeholders on the 
        compatibility of NOAA Weather Radio data for third party 
        platforms that provide online services, such as websites and 
        mobile device applications, or deliver NOAA Weather Radio 
        access;
            (3) existing or new management systems, which promote 
        consistent, efficient, and compatible access to NOAA Weather 
        Radio;
            (4) the ability of NOAA to aggregate real time broadcast 
        feeds at one or more central locations;
            (5) effective interagency coordination;
            (6) the potential effects of an electromagnetic pulse or 
        geomagnetic disturbance on NOAA Weather Radio; and
            (7) any other function the Administrator deems necessary.
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $40,000,000 to remain available 
until expended.

            Passed the House of Representatives May 11, 2022.

            Attest:

                                             CHERYL L. JOHNSON,

                                                                 Clerk.

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security 
Capabilities Preservation Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. PRESERVATION OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
              CAPABILITIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Plan.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, acting through the Administrator of the Federal 
        Emergency Management Agency, shall submit to the Committee on 
        Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the 
        Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
        Senate a plan, informed by the survey information collected 
        pursuant to subsection (b), to make Federal assistance 
        available for at least three consecutive fiscal years to 
        certain urban areas that in the current fiscal year did not 
        receive grant funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative 
        under section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 
        U.S.C. 604) and require continued Federal assistance for the 
        purpose of preserving a homeland security capability related to 
        preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and responding 
        to acts of terrorism that had been developed or otherwise 
        supported through prior grant funding under such Initiative and 
        allow for such urban areas to transition to such urban areas 
        costs of preserving such homeland security 
        capabilities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Additional requirement.--The plan required 
        under paragraph (1) shall also contain a prohibition on an 
        urban area that in a fiscal year is eligible to receive Federal 
        assistance described in such paragraph from also receiving 
        grant funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative under 
        section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In such a 
        case, such plan shall require such an urban area to promptly 
        notify the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency regarding the preference of such urban area to retain 
        either--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) such eligibility for such Federal 
                assistance; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) such receipt of such grant 
                funding.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Survey.--In developing the plan required under 
subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, shall, to ascertain the scope of Federal assistance required, 
survey urban areas that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) did not receive grant funding under the Urban 
        Area Security Initiative under section 2003 of the Homeland 
        Security Act of 2002 in the current fiscal year concerning 
        homeland security capabilities related to preventing, preparing 
        for, protecting against, and responding to acts of terrorism 
        that had been developed or otherwise supported through funding 
        under such Initiative that are at risk of being reduced or 
        eliminated without such Federal assistance;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) received such funding in the current fiscal 
        year, but did not receive such funding in at least one fiscal 
        year in the six fiscal years immediately preceding the current 
        fiscal year; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) any other urban areas the Secretary determines 
        appropriate.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Exemption.--The Secretary of Homeland Security may 
exempt the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the requirements of 
subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code (commonly 
referred to as the ``Paperwork Reduction Act''), for purposes of 
carrying out subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that complying 
with such requirements would delay the development of the plan required 
under subsection (a).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a) 
shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) establish eligibility criteria for urban areas 
        to receive Federal assistance pursuant to such plan to provide 
        assistance for the purpose described in such 
        subsection;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) identify annual funding levels for such 
        Federal assistance in accordance with the survey required under 
        subsection (b); and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) consider a range of approaches to make such 
        Federal assistance available to such urban areas, including--
        &lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) modifications to the Urban Area 
                Security Initiative under section 2003 of the Homeland 
                Security Act of 2002 in a manner that would not affect 
                the availability of funding to urban areas under such 
                Initiative;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the establishment of a competitive 
                grant program;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the establishment of a formula grant 
                program; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) a timeline for the implementation of 
                any such approach and, if necessary, a legislative 
                proposal to authorize any such approach.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

establish the Invisible Guaranteed Coverage Pool Reinsurance Program 
(in this section referred to as the ``IGCPR program'').

from amounts appropriated under subsection (f) for a fiscal year, award 
grants to States for such fiscal year, in amounts determined in

maintaining a qualifying Invisible Guaranteed Coverage Pool for the 
State.
    (c) Federal Default.--
            (1) In general.--In the case of a State that does not, by a 
        date and in a manner specified by the Secretary, choose to be 
        awarded a grant under subsection (b) for a fiscal year to 
        operate a qualifying Invisible Guaranteed Coverage Pool for the 
        State, the Secretary shall, from amounts appropriated under 
        subsection (f) for such fiscal year, use the allocation 
        determined for the State under subsection (d) for participation 
        of such State in the Federal default qualifying Invisible 
        Guaranteed Coverage Pool described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Federal default qualifying invisible guaranteed 
        coverage pool.--The Federal default qualifying high risk pool 
        is, with respect to each State that chooses not to be awarded a 
        grant under subsection (b) with respect to a fiscal year for 
        which funds are appropriated under subsection (f), an Invisible 
        Guaranteed Coverage Pool under which health insurance issuers 
        participating in the Exchange of such a State, with respect to 
        designated individuals who are enrolled in health insurance 
        coverage and are expected to experience higher than average 
        health costs as determined by the insurer, cede risk to the 
        pool, without affecting the premium paid by the designated 
        individuals or their terms of coverage. With respect to such 
        pool--
                    (A) high-risk individuals designated for cession to 
                the pool shall be designated by the ceding issuer;
                    (B) the premium amount the ceding issuer shall pay 
                to the reinsurance pool shall be 90 percent of the 
                premium paid to the issuer for the coverage;
                    (C) the ceding issuer shall retain the same risk 
                under the ceded policies as under any other policy of 
                the issuer with respect to the first $10,000 of 
                benefits for each ceded policy involved and will not 
                retain any risk under ceded policies after such first 
                $10,000 of benefits; and
                    (D) after a ceding issuer, with respect to a ceded 
                policy, no longer retains risk under such policy 
                pursuant to subparagraph (C), the negotiated rate under 
                such policy for items and services shall be payable at 
                the reimbursement rate under the Medicare program under 
                title XVIII of the Social Security Act for such items 
                and services, or in the case of items and services for 
                which payment is available under the policy but not the 
                Medicare program, at a rate determined by the 
                Secretary.
    (d) Allocation Methodology.--Not later than six months after the 
establishment of the IGCPR program, the Secretary shall specify an 
allocation methodology for determining the amount of funds appropriated 
under subsection (f) for a fiscal year to be allocated for each State 
for purposes of subsections (b) and (c). Such methodology shall be 
based on the number of residents of each State and the general health 
status of such residents.
    (e) Qualifying Invisible Guaranteed Coverage Pool.--For purposes of 
this section, the term ``qualifying Invisible Guaranteed Coverage 
Pool'' means, with respect to a State, a method of designation under 
which health insurance issuers identify individuals who experience 
higher than average health costs as determined by the State and are 
enrolled in health insurance coverage offered in the individual market, 
and cede the risk of spending more than $10,000 on health care services 
for a single individual to the pool without affecting the premium paid 
by the designated individuals or their terms of coverage. With respect 
to such pool, the State, or an entity operating the pool on behalf of 
the State, shall establish--
            (1) the premium amount the ceding issuer shall pay to the 
        reinsurance pool;
            (2) the applicable attachment points or coinsurance 
        percentages if the ceding issuer retains any portion of the 
        risk under ceded policies, except that the provisions of 
        subparagraphs (C) and (D) of subsection (c)(2) shall apply to 
        such high risk pool in the same manner as such clauses apply to 
        the Federal default high risk pool; and
            (3) the mechanism by which high-risk individuals are 
        designated for cession to the pool, which may include a list of 
        designated high-cost health conditions.
    (f) Appropriations.--There is appropriated to the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services $200,000,000,000 to carry out this section

``SEC. 524B. PROVISIONAL APPROVAL OF NEW HUMAN DRUGS.

    ``(a) Priority Review and Evaluation of Applications.--

        under the pathway under this section is eligible for a special 
        designation by the Secretary under this Act, including as a

        benefits of such other designation shall be available for use 
        under provisional approval, including any tax credits and 
        waiving of fees under chapter VII.

        for which there is a reasonable likelihood that premature death 
        will occur without early medical intervention for an individual

                clinical investigations, by experts qualified by 
                scientific training and experience to evaluate the 
                safety of the drug involved, on the basis of which it 
                could fairly and responsibly be concluded that the drug 
                will have the effect it purports or is represented to 
                have under the conditions of use prescribed, 
                recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed 
                labeling; and

                adequate and well-controlled investigations, including

                        therapeutic outcome; and

                        consistent with or greater than currently 
                        marketed on-label therapies, with equal or 
                        fewer side effects, if there are currently 
                        marketed on-label therapies.

        establish the appropriate protocols for a sponsor of an 
        application for provisional approval under this section and the 
        Commissioner to follow to enable rolling, real-time, mid-trial 
        submission while preserving the integrity of the ongoing trial 
        and without penalizing the sponsor for making use of this 
        pathway.
            ``(3) Real world evidence.--The Secretary shall allow the 
        use of real world evidence (as defined in section 505F(b)), 
        including real world data used to generate real world evidence, 
        to support an application for provisional approval under this 
        section, and to fulfill the follow-up requirements and support

each patient, or the patient's representative, informed consent, 
through a signed informed consent form, acknowledging that such patient

        based, or the number of claimants, plaintiffs, defendants, or 
        other parties, or the number of claims or causes of action, in 
        which the claimant alleges a health care liability claim. Such

        to Federal, State, or local government; or which is grounded in

            (8) Health care liability action.--The term ``health care 
        liability action'' means a civil action brought in a State or 
        Federal court or pursuant to an alternative dispute resolution 
        system, against a health care provider regardless of the theory 
        of liability on which the claim is based, or the number of 
        plaintiffs, defendants, or other parties, or the number of

        provision or use of (or the failure to provide or use) health 
        care services or medical products, regardless of the theory of 
        liability on which the claim is based, or the number of 
        plaintiffs, defendants, or other parties, or the number of 
        causes of action.
            (10) Health care provider.--The term ``health care 
        provider'' means any person or entity required by State or 
        Federal laws or regulations to be licensed, registered, or

        or care of the health of human beings.
            (12) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means a 
        drug, device, or biological product intended for humans, and

        the meanings given such terms in sections 201(g)(1) and 201(h) 
        of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)

SEC. 382. ENCOURAGING SPEEDY RESOLUTION OF CLAIMS.

    (a) Statute of Limitations.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        time for the commencement of a health care lawsuit shall be, 
        whichever occurs first of the following:
                    (A) Three years after the date of the occurrence of 
                the breach or tort.
                    (B) Three years after the date the medical or 
                health care treatment that is the subject of the claim 
                is completed.
                    (C) One year after the claimant discovers, or 
                through the use of reasonable diligence should have 
                discovered, the injury.
            (2) Tolling.--In no event shall the time for commencement 
        of a health care lawsuit exceed 3 years after the date of the 
        occurrence of the breach or tort or 3 years after the date the 
        medical or health care treatment that is the subject of the 
        claim is completed (whichever occurs first) unless tolled for 
        any of the following--
                    (A) upon proof of fraud;
                    (B) intentional concealment; or
                    (C) the presence of a foreign body, which has no 
                therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect, in the 
                person of the injured person.
            (3) Actions by a minor.--Actions by a minor shall be 
        commenced within 3 years after the date of the occurrence of 
        the breach or tort or 3 years after the date of the medical or 
        health care treatment that is the subject of the claim is 
        completed (whichever occurs first) except that actions by a 
        minor under the full age of 6 years shall be commenced within 3 
        years after the date of the occurrence of the breach or tort, 3 
        years after the date of the medical or health care treatment 
        that is the subject of the claim is completed, or 1 year after 
        the injury is discovered, or through the use of reasonable 
        diligence should have been discovered, or prior to the minor's 
        8th birthday, whichever provides a longer period. Such time 
        limitation shall be tolled for minors for any period during 
        which a parent or guardian and a health care provider have 
        committed fraud or collusion in the failure to bring an action 
        on behalf of the injured minor.
    (b) State Flexibility.--No provision of subsection (a) shall be 
construed to preempt any State law (whether effective before, on, or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act) that--
            (1) specifies a time period of less than 3 years after the 
        date of injury or less than 1 year after the claimant 
        discovers, or through the use of reasonable diligence should 
        have discovered, the injury, for the filing of a health care 
        lawsuit;
            (2) that specifies a different time period for the filing 
        of lawsuits by a minor;
            (3) that triggers the time period based on the date of the 
        alleged negligence; or
            (4) establishes a statute of repose for the filing of a 
        health care lawsuit.

SEC. 383. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.

    (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses in 
Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing in this Act 
shall limit a claimant's recovery of the full amount of the available 
economic damages, notwithstanding the limitation in subsection (b).
    (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--In any health care lawsuit, 
the amount of noneconomic damages, if available, shall not exceed 
$250,000, regardless of the number of parties against whom the action 
is brought or the number of separate claims or actions brought with 
respect to the same injury.
    (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--For purposes of 
applying the limitation in subsection (b), future noneconomic damages 
shall not be discounted to present value. The jury shall not be 
informed about the maximum award for noneconomic damages. An award for 
noneconomic damages in excess of $250,000 shall be reduced either 
before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the judgment after 
entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be made before accounting 
for any other reduction in damages required by law. If separate awards 
are rendered for past and future noneconomic damages and the combined 
awards exceed $250,000, the future noneconomic damages shall be reduced 
first.
    (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each party shall 
be liable for that party's several share of any damages only and not 
for the share of any other person. Each party shall be liable only for 
the amount of damages allocated to such party in direct proportion to 
such party's percentage of responsibility. Whenever a judgment of 
liability is rendered as to any party, a separate judgment shall be 
rendered against each such party for the amount allocated to such 
party. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine 
the proportion of responsibility of each party for the claimant's harm.
    (e) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall be 
construed to preempt any State law (whether effective before, on, or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies a 
particular monetary amount of economic or noneconomic damages (or the 
total amount of damages) that may be awarded in a health care lawsuit, 
regardless of whether such monetary amount is greater or lesser than is 
provided for under this section.

SEC. 384. MAXIMIZING PATIENT RECOVERY.

    (a) Court Supervision of Share of Damages Actually Paid to 
Claimants.--In any health care lawsuit, the court shall supervise the 
arrangements for payment of damages to protect against conflicts of 
interest that may have the effect of reducing the amount of damages 
awarded that are actually paid to claimants. In particular, in any 
health care lawsuit in which the attorney for a party claims a 
financial stake in the outcome by virtue of a contingent fee, the court 
shall have the power to restrict the payment of a claimant's damage 
recovery to such attorney, and to redirect such damages to the claimant 
based upon the interests of justice and principles of equity. In no 
event shall the total of all contingent fees for representing all 
claimants in a health care lawsuit exceed the following limits:
            (1) Forty percent of the first $50,000 recovered by the 
        claimant(s).
            (2) Thirty-three and one-third percent of the next $50,000 
        recovered by the claimant(s).
            (3) Twenty-five percent of the next $500,000 recovered by 
        the claimant(s).
            (4) Fifteen percent of any amount by which the recovery by 
        the claimant(s) is in excess of $600,000.
    (b) Applicability.--The limitations in this section shall apply 
whether the recovery is by judgment, settlement, mediation, 
arbitration, or any other form of alternative dispute resolution. In a 
health care lawsuit involving a minor or incompetent person, a court 
retains the authority to authorize or approve a fee that is less than 
the maximum permitted under this section. The requirement for court 
supervision in the first two sentences of subsection (a) applies only 
in civil actions.
    (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall be 
construed to preempt any State law (whether effective before, on, or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies a lesser 
percentage or lesser total value of damages which may be claimed by an 
attorney representing a claimant in a health care lawsuit.

SEC. 385. AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO CLAIMANTS IN 
              HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.

    (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of future 
damages, without reduction to present value, equaling or exceeding 
$50,000 is made against a party with sufficient insurance or other 
assets to fund a periodic payment of such a judgment, the court shall, 
at the request of any party, enter a judgment ordering that the future 
damages be paid by periodic payments, in accordance with the Uniform 
Periodic Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.
    (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions which have 
not been first set for trial or retrial before the effective date of 
this Act.
    (c) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall be 
construed to preempt any State law (whether effective before, on, or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act) that specifies periodic 
payments for future damages at any amount other than $50,000 or that 
mandates such payments absent the request of either party.

SEC. 386. PRODUCT LIABILITY FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS.

    A health care provider who prescribes, or who dispenses pursuant to 
a prescription, a medical product approved, licensed, or cleared by the 
Food and Drug Administration shall not be named as a party to a product 
liability lawsuit involving such product and shall not be liable to a 
claimant in a class action lawsuit against the manufacturer, 
distributor, or seller of such product.

SEC. 387. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.

    (a) Vaccine Injury.--
            (1) To the extent that title XXI of the Public Health 
        Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law applicable to a 
        civil action brought for a vaccine-related injury or death--
                    (A) this Act does not affect the application of the 
                rule of law to such an action; and
                    (B) any rule of law prescribed by this subtitle in 
                conflict with a rule of law of such title XXI shall not 
                apply to such action.
            (2) If there is an aspect of a civil action brought for a 
        vaccine-related injury or death to which a Federal rule of law 
        under title XXI of the Public Health Service Act does not 
        apply, then this subtitle or otherwise applicable law (as 
        determined under this subtitle) will apply to such aspect of 
        such action.
    (b) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, nothing 
in this subtitle shall be deemed to affect any defense available to a 
defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other provision 
of Federal law.

SEC. 388. LIMITATION ON EXPERT WITNESS TESTIMONY.

    (a) In General.--No person in a health care profession requiring 
licensure under the laws of a State shall be competent to testify in 
any court of law to establish the following facts--
            (1) the recognized standard of acceptable professional 
        practice and the specialty thereof, if any, that the defendant 
        practices, which shall be the type of acceptable professional 
        practice recognized in the defendant's community or in a 
        community similar to the defendant's community that was in 
        place at the time the alleged injury or wrongful action 
        occurred;
            (2) that the defendant acted with less than or failed to 
        act with ordinary and reasonable care in accordance with the 
        recognized standard; and
            (3) that as a proximate result of the defendant's negligent 
        act or omission, the claimant suffered injuries which would not 
        otherwise have occurred,
unless the person was licensed to practice, in the State or a 
contiguous bordering State, a profession or specialty which would make 
the person's expert testimony relevant to the issues in the case and 
had practiced this profession or specialty in one of these States 
during the year preceding the date that the alleged injury or wrongful 
act occurred.
    (b) Applicability.--The requirements set forth in subsection (a) 
shall also apply to expert witnesses testifying for the defendant as 
rebuttal witnesses.
    (c) Waiver Authority.--The court may waive the requirements in this 
subsection if it determines that the appropriate witnesses otherwise 
would not be available.

SEC. 389. EXPERT WITNESS QUALIFICATIONS.

    (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, an individual shall 
not give expert testimony on the appropriate standard of practice or 
care involved unless the individual is licensed as a health 
professional in one or more States and the individual meets the 
following criteria:
            (1) If the party against whom or on whose behalf the 
        testimony is to be offered is or claims to be a specialist, the 
        expert witness shall specialize at the time of the occurrence 
        that is the basis for the lawsuit in the same specialty or 
        claimed specialty as the party against whom or on whose behalf 
        the testimony is to be offered. If the party against whom or on 
        whose behalf the testimony is to be offered is or claims to be 
        a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness shall 
        be a specialist who is board certified in that specialty or 
        claimed specialty.
            (2) During the 1-year period immediately preceding the 
        occurrence of the action that gave rise to the lawsuit, the

        individual's professional time to one or more of the following:
                    (A) The active clinical practice of the same health 
                profession as the defendant and, if the defendant is or 
                claims to be a specialist, in the same specialty or 
                claimed specialty.
                    (B) The instruction of students in an accredited 
                health professional school or accredited residency or 
                clinical research program in the same health profession 
                as the defendant and, if the defendant is or claims to 
                be a specialist, in an accredited health professional 
                school or accredited residency or clinical research 
                program in the same specialty or claimed specialty.
            (3) If the defendant is a general practitioner, the expert 
        witness shall have devoted a majority of the witness's 
        professional time in the 1-year period preceding the occurrence 
        of the action giving rise to the lawsuit to one or more of the 
        following:
                    (A) Active clinical practice as a general

    (b) Lawsuits Against Entities.--If the defendant in a health care 
lawsuit is an entity that employs a person against whom or on whose 
behalf the testimony is offered, the provisions of subsection (a) apply 
as if the person were the party or defendant against whom or on whose 
behalf the testimony is offered.
    (c) Power of Court.--Nothing in this section shall limit the power 
of the trial court in a health care lawsuit to disqualify an expert 
witness on grounds other than the qualifications set forth under this 
subsection.
    (d) Limitation.--An expert witness in a health care lawsuit shall 
not be permitted to testify if the fee of the witness is in any way 
contingent on the outcome of the lawsuit.
    (e) State Flexibility.--No provision of this section shall be 
construed to preempt any State law (whether effective before, on, or 
after the date of the enactment of this Act) that places additional

the patient, or a representative of the patient and which relate to the 
discomfort, pain, suffering, injury, or death of the patient as the 
result of the unanticipated outcome of medical care shall be 
inadmissible for any purpose as evidence of an admission of liability 
or as evidence of an admission against interest.

this subtitle preempt, subject to subsections (b) and (c), State law to 
the extent that State law prevents the application of any provisions of 
law established by or under this subtitle. The provisions governing 
health care lawsuits set forth in this subtitle supersede chapter 171 
of title 28, United States Code, to the extent that such chapter--
            (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent 
        fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be 
        commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic 
        payment of future damages, than provided in this subtitle; or
            (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding 
        collateral source benefits, or mandates or permits subrogation 
        or a lien on collateral source benefits.
    (b) Protection of States' Rights and Other Laws.--Any issue that is 
not governed by any provision of law established by or under this 
subtitle (including State standards of negligence) shall be governed by 
otherwise applicable State or Federal law.

construed to preempt any defense available to a party in a health care 
lawsuit under any other provision of State or Federal law.

SEC. 395. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This subtitle shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought in a 
Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative dispute resolution 
system, that is initiated on or after the date of the enactment of this 
subtitle, except that any health care lawsuit arising from an injury 
occurring prior to the date of the enactment of this subtitle shall be 
governed by the applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect 
at the time the cause of action accrued.

method described in subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish a 
process to allow an individual to enroll in prescription drug coverage.

difference between Medicare payment and required premium of the plan 
they choose, and get 100 percent of the savings by choosing a plan with 
a premium below the benchmark.

the time of the enactment of this section, there shall be a limit on

beneficiaries multiyear contracts with guaranteed premiums over such 
years, bearing the risk of any change in payments from the Secretary in

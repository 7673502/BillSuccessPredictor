        require, shall be exempt from any Federal mandate requiring a 
        vaccine for COVID-19.
            (2) Reimbursement.--Subject to the availability of 
        appropriations, the employing agency shall reimburse any 
        Federal employee at that agency for the costs of any COVID-19 
        antibody test for the purposes of carrying out paragraph (1).
            (3) Prohibition on adverse action.--No adverse action 
        (including a suspension, furlough, removal, or reduction in pay 
        or grade) may be taken against any Federal employee who elects 
        to meet the requirements of the exemption described in 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Employee defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``Federal employee'' has the meaning given the term 
        ``employee'' in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code, 
        and includes--
                    (A) an officer or employee of the United States 
                Postal Service or of the Postal Regulatory Commission; 
                and
                    (B) an employee appointed under chapter 73 or 74 of 
                title 38, United States Code, notwithstanding section 
                7425(b) of such title.
    (b) Federal Contractors.--Any contract entered into by the Federal 
Government that requires any employee or individual described under 
that contract, or any subcontract (at any tier), to receive a COVID-19 
vaccination shall include--
            (1) an exemption from such requirement for any such 
        employee or individual who provides proof of the presence of 
        COVID-19 antibodies;
            (2) a requirement that any such employee or individual who 
        so provides proof shall be reimbursed, at the expense of the 
        Federal Government, for the cost of any applicable COVID-19 
        antibody test; and
            (3) a requirement that the contractor may not retaliate 
        against any employee who elects to meet the requirements of the 
        exemption described in paragraph (1).

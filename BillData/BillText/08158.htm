              military installations in United States
    ``(a) Access to Military Installations in United States.--(1) The 
Secretary of Defense shall maintain access standards applicable to all 
military installations in the United States. Such standards shall 
require screening standards appropriate to the type of installation 
involved, the security level of the installation, the category of 
individuals authorized to visit the installation, and the level of 
access to be granted, including--
            ``(A) protocols to determine the fitness of the individual 
        to enter an installation; and
            ``(B) standards and methods for verifying the identity of 
        the individual.
    ``(2) In developing the standards under paragraph (1), the 
Secretary shall, with respect to military installations in the United 
States--
            ``(A) provide for expedited access to such military 
        installations for covered individuals;
            ``(B) provide for closer scrutiny of categories of 
        individuals determined by the Secretary of Defense to pose a 
        higher potential security risk;
            ``(C) in the case of such a military installation that the 
        Secretary determines contains particularly sensitive 
        facilities, provide additional screening requirements, as well 
        as physical and other security measures for the installation; 
        and
            ``(D) prescribe regulations setting forth minimum criteria 
        for the fitness of individuals to be granted unescorted access 
        to such military installations, taking into account individuals 
        who hold a covered Federally recognized access credential, and 
        including a process by which such individuals may be eligible 
        for expedited unescorted access.
    ``(3) Upon publication in the Federal Register of the final 
regulations under paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary shall publish the 
minimum criteria set forth therein on a publicly accessible Internet 
website of the Department of Defense.
    ``(4) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall seek to 
procure and field existing identification screening technology 
(including technology to enable the Secretary to validate other 
Federally recognized access credentials) and develop additional 
technology only to the extent necessary to assist commanders of 
military installations in the United States in implementing the 
standards under paragraph (1) at points of entry for such 
installations.
    ``(b) Specific Protocol for Access to Military Installations in 
United States for Certain Deliveries.--The Secretary shall ensure that 
the standards under subsection (a) include a specific protocol for the 
screening, prior to any delivery of a freight shipment or shipment of 
household goods, of the identity, fitness, and purpose of any 
individual seeking access to a military installation in the United 
States for such delivery. Under such protocol--
            ``(1) the screening shall occur not less than 24 hours 
        prior to the time of such delivery; and
            ``(2) if an individual is determined fit to enter the 
        installation pursuant to the screening, access may only be 
        granted upon arrival at the military installation on the date 
        of the delivery, following a verification of the identity of 
        the individual.
    ``(c) Unescorted Access to Military Installations in United States 
for Certain Civilians.--The Secretary shall maintain guidance regarding 
the granting of unescorted access to military installations in the 
United States for covered civilians and ensure such guidance is 
circulated to the commanders of each such military installation. Such 
guidance shall--
            ``(1) identify the categories of covered civilians that may 
        obtain such unescorted access;
            ``(2) include a recommendation to issue access cards that 
        expire on the date that is two years after the date of 
        issuance, notwithstanding any change in the commander of the 
        installation or delegation of authority letters issued by the 
        previous commander;
            ``(3) be consistent across military installations in the 
        United States; and
            ``(4) be in accordance with any privileges or benefits 
        accorded under, procedures developed pursuant to, or 
        requirements of, each covered provision and subsection (a).
    ``(d) Access Cards.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop access 
cards to be issued to individuals granted access to military 
installations in the United States. To the extent practicable, such 
access cards shall be interoperable across the following:

            ``(2) Military departments.
            ``(3) Defense Agencies.

        designated main entrance that, at all times, is manned by at 
        least one member of the armed forces or civilian employee of 
        the Department;
            ``(2) the location of each such designated main entrance is 
        published on a publicly accessible Internet website of the 
        Department;
            ``(3) if a military installation in the United States has 
        any additional entrance designated for commercial deliveries to 
        the military installation, the location of such entrance (and 
        any applicable days or hours of operation for such entrance) is 
        published on the same Internet website specified in paragraph 
        (2); and
            ``(4) the information published on the Internet website 
        specified in paragraph (2) is reviewed and, as necessary, 
        updated on a basis that is not less frequent than annually.
    ``(f) Reviews and Submission to Congress.--On a basis that is not 
less frequent than once every five years, the Secretary shall--
            ``(1) review the standards and guidance under this section, 
        and make such updates as may be determined appropriate by the 
        Secretary; and
            ``(2) submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the

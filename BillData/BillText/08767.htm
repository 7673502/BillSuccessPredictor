                                 A BILL


 
To establish a private right of action for parents with respect to the 
 teaching of racial discrimination theory and other actions by covered 
                    schools, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Parents Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The family unit consisting of a mother, father, and 
        child is the foundation of civil society.
            (2) The rights and authority of parents are God-given and 
        self-evident.
            (3) The rights and authority of parents do not derive from 
        the government.
            (4) The rights and authority of parents should not be 
        challenged or undermined by the government, but must be 
        preserved and protected.
            (5) Parents are responsible for impressing faith, morals, 
        and values upon their children; such responsibility does not 
        belong to teachers, school board members, or politicians.
            (6) No teacher, school board member, or public official has 
        the right to politicize or indoctrinate children.
            (7) More than 70 percent of citizens of the United States 
        support the ability of parents to choose where students attend 
        school.
            (8) It is contrary to the 10th Amendment of the 
        Constitution and the principles of federalism espoused by the 
        founding fathers for the Federal Government to supersede State 
        or local authorities regarding the instruction and testing of 
        students.
            (9) Taxpayers have a right to know what publicly funded 
        schools are teaching students.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a covered school should not--
                    (A) deny a student the ability to attend school in 
                person;
                    (B) intentionally expose a student to racial 
                discrimination theory;
                    (C) intentionally expose a student to radical 
                gender theory or sexually explicit content;
                    (D) require a biological woman to compete against a 
                biological man in an athletic competition hosted or 
                sponsored by such school;
                    (E) require a biological woman and a biological man 
                to share a private facility, including--
                            (i) a restroom;
                            (ii) a locker room;
                            (iii) a shower facility; or
                            (iv) a changing room; or
                    (F) require a student to abide by a health mandate 
                without first obtaining parental consent or require, as 
                a prerequisite for in-person school attendance--
                            (i) wearing a mask;
                            (ii) receiving a COVID-19 vaccine; or
                            (iii) subjecting to a medical screening;
            (2) a covered school should--
                    (A) protect the personal information of every 
                student, as required under section 444 of the General 
                Education Provisions Act (commonly known as the 
                ``Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974'' ) 
                (20 U.S.C. 1232g); and
                    (B) be parent-led and locally managed with State 
                oversight;
            (3) Federal law enforcement agencies should not target a 
        parent for exercising First Amendment rights on school property 
        or in school board meetings; and
            (4) a parent should have the ability to choose the school 
        that the children of such parent attend.

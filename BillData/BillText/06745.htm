SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING THE LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUND FOR 
              SMALL DOLLAR LOANS.

    The sense of Congress is the following:
            (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund 
        (the ``CDFI Fund'') is an agency of the Department of the 
        Treasury, and was established by the Riegle Community 
        Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
        of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity for 
        underserved people and communities by supporting the growth and 
        capacity of a national network of community development 
        lenders, investors, and financial service providers''. A 
        community development financial institution (a ``CDFI'') is a 
        specialized financial institution serving low-income 
        communities and a Community Development Entity (a ``CDE'') is a 
        domestic corporation or partnership that is an intermediary 
        vehicle for the provision of loans, investments, or financial 
        counseling in low-income communities. The CDFI Fund certifies 
        CDFIs and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE allows 
        organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund programs as 
        follows:
                    (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which 
                provides FDIC-insured depository institutions awards 
                for a demonstrated increase in lending and investments 
                in distressed communities and CDFIs.
                    (B) The CDFI Program, which provides Financial and 
                Technical Assistance awards to CDFIs to reinvest in the 
                CDFI, and to build the capacity of the CDFI, including 
                financing product development and loan loss reserves.
                    (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, 
                which provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial 
                and Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and 
                grow the number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to 
                help build capacity of such CDFIs.
                    (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which 
                provides tax credits for making equity investments in 
                CDEs that stimulate capital investments in low-income 
                communities.
                    (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards 
                to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable housing organizations 
                to finance affordable housing solutions and related 
                economic development activities.
                    (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-
                term, patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and 
                investment capacity for community and economic 
                development purposes.
            (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create 
        multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-moderate 
        income individuals to establish accounts at federally insured 
        banks, and to improve low-to-moderate income individuals' 
        access to such accounts on reasonable terms.
            (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI 
        Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to 
        establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related 
        losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients 
        with the financial counseling and education necessary to 
        conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans 
        provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
        nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive 
        interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of 
        Americans to fall into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can only 
        be made pursuant to terms, conditions, and practices that are 
        reasonable for the individual consumer obtaining the loan.
            (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible 
        institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in 
        section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt from 
        tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured depository 
        institutions, community development financial institutions and 
        State, local, or Tribal government entities.
            (5) According to the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as 
        much as $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
        CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress should 
        prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan loss reserve 
        fund and technical assistance programs administered by the 
        Community Development Financial Institution Fund.

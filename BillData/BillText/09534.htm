    To carry out this Act, there is authorized to be appropriated for

                            TITLE II--POLICY

SEC. 201. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Commercial activity in space is accelerating to meet 
        the global demand for a growing commercial space market.
            (2) Space is becoming more congested, particularly in some 
        orbital regimes, with the number of active satellites 
        increasing significantly over the past ten years and continuing 
        to grow.
            (3) Orbital debris ranging from sub-millimeter-sized debris 
        to large defunct rocket bodies and inoperable spacecraft 
        threatens the safety of orbital operations.
            (4) Space situational awareness provides the foundation for 
        understanding--
                    (A) where objects, both active and inactive, are 
                located and for predicting where satellites or debris 
                will be in the future; and
                    (B) the distribution of orbital debris and the risk 
                they pose to operational satellites and crewed 
                spacecraft.
            (5) United States leadership in coordinating international 
        efforts on space situational awareness is essential for the 
        safety and sustainability of the space environment, including 
        human activities in outer space.
            (6) Conducting safe and responsible space operations will 
        have a major impact on the sustainability of space activities, 
        and in turn for the prosperity and national security of the 
        United States.
            (7) To date, the Secretary of Defense, acting through the 
        Commander, United States Space Command, has been providing 
        certain space situational awareness services and information to 
        Federal Government, commercial and international space 
        operators, and the international community, including warnings 
        of potential conjunctions.

SEC. 202. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITY.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States Government, in 
coordination with other countries and the private sector, has a 
responsibility to be a good steward of the space environment. It is the 
further sense of Congress that the United States Government should--
            (1) lead in practices and policies to maintain a safe, 
        sustainable space environment for civil, national security, and 
        commercial use;
            (2) provide validated space situational awareness services 
        and information as public goods for the purposes of promoting 
        on-orbit operational safety;
            (3) develop a coordinated and integrated approach to 
        improving and delivering space situational awareness services 
        and information;
            (4) leverage, to the maximum extent practicable, commercial 
        innovation and capabilities relevant to space situational 
        awareness;
            (5) lead collaborations with international and non-
        governmental entities, including satellite operators and space 
        situational awareness services and information providers, as 
        appropriate, on space situational awareness and on best 
        practices regarding space traffic coordination that--
                    (A) support the growth of commerce in space and 
                foster a competitive United States commercial space 
                industry; and
                    (B) promote innovation in technology and operations 
                while improving safety;
            (6) lead the international community in collaborations on 
        practices and approaches that advance a sustainable and 
        accessible space environment; and
            (7) transition to the Department of Commerce certain space 
        situational awareness services and information, including 
        public conjunction notifications, from the Department of 
        Defense.

SEC. 203. UNITED STATES POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) make publicly and continually available, free of direct 
        user fees, validated space situational awareness services and 
        information, including conjunction data messages;
            (2) continue to enhance and improve the accuracy and 
        precision of the services and information referred to in 
        paragraph (1);
            (3) make available to governmental and non-governmental 
        space operators space safety and sustainability tools, private 
        sector-led voluntary consensus standards, and risk mitigation 
        information and practices;
            (4) support interdisciplinary research and development to 
        promote space safety and improve space situational awareness;
            (5) support mechanisms for transitioning into operational 
        activities the research and development described in paragraph 
        (4);
            (6) support the use, where validated and practicable, of 
        commercial technologies, data, systems, and services that can 
        supplement and enhance United States Government-provided space 
        situational awareness services and information;
            (7) ensure the Federal Government remains the United States 
        authoritative source for United States conjunction data 
        messages;
            (8) promote and facilitate the development and encourage 
        the adoption of private sector-led voluntary consensus 
        standards and best practices for space situational awareness; 
        and
            (9) lead international collaborations to the widest extent 
        possible on a framework for internationally harmonized space 
        situational awareness and best practices for space traffic 
        coordination.

 TITLE III--TRANSITION TO CIVIL SPACE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CAPABILITY

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NEED FOR TRANSITION.

    It is the sense of Congress that the DoD continues to make 
essential contributions to the safety of the space environment by 
providing space operators with services and information for managing 
the safe operations of United States Government, commercial, and non-
United States space operations, in accordance with section 2274 of 
title 10, United States Code. It is the further sense of Congress that 
the growing number of space objects has created an increasing demand 
for improved accuracy and precision of space situational awareness 
services and information for space operators, which requires personnel 
and resources that are not related to the DoD's primary mission. 
Therefore, it is the sense of Congress that the President should 
provide all necessary support to plan for an effective transition to 
the Department of Commerce from the Department of Defense of certain 
space situational awareness services and information.

SEC. 302. INTERAGENCY TRANSITION TEAM.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary and the Secretary of Defense, in

to as the ``Interagency Transition Team'') to lead the planning, 
assessment, and transition of certain activities carried out under 
section 2274 of title 10, United States Code, as appropriate, from the 
existing DoD-based space situational awareness operations to a civil

                including the issuance of conjunction data messages, 
                carried out under section 2274 of title 10, United 
                States Code, to a civil space situational awareness

                            (i) Federal Government and non-government 
                        space situational awareness capabilities and 
                        needs for an initial operational capability and

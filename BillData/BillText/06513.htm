        at the end the following: ``or any non-invasive diagnostic 
        device''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes of

        respect to a diagnostic device, that the device does not 
        penetrate the skin or any other membrane of the body, is not 
        inserted or implanted into the body, causes no more than 
        ephemeral compression or temperature changes to in situ bodily 
        tissues, and does not subject bodily tissues to ionizing 
        radiation.''.

    Section 8438 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(i)(1) In this subsection--
            ``(A) the term `PCAOB' means the Public Company Accounting 
        Oversight Board; and
            ``(B) the term `registered public accounting firm' has the 
        meaning given the term in section 2(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
        Act of 2002 (15 U.S.C. 7201(a)).
    ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no sums

from conducting a complete inspection or investigation of a registered 
public accounting firm under section 104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002 (15 U.S.C. 7214) because of a position taken by an authority in 
that jurisdiction, as determined by the PCAOB.
    ``(3) The Board shall consult with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on a biennial basis in order to ensure compliance with 
paragraph (2).''.

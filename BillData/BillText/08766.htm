                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Secretary of Energy to conduct studies relating to 
  Strategic Petroleum Reserve levels, to amend the Energy Policy and 
 Conservation Act with respect to such Reserve, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reserving Energy For Independence 
and Empowerment Act'' or the ``REFINE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created through the 
        Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231 et seq.) to 
        address ``severe energy supply interruptions'' and provided the 
        executive branch authority to draw down these reserves provided 
        that specific conditions are met.
            (2) According to the U.S. Energy Information 
        Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2022, petroleum and 
        natural gas will remain the most-consumed sources of energy in 
        the United States through 2050.
            (3) As of August 19, 2022, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
        fell to 453.1 million barrels, from a maximum capacity of 714 
        million barrels, which is the lowest level since 1985.
            (4) Emergency sales in 2022 from the Strategic Petroleum 
        Reserve were purchased by Unipec, a subsidiary of Chinese oil 
        giant Sinopec, and delivered to the People's Republic of China, 
        the principle strategic competitor to the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) continuing to limit energy production in the United 
        States will only provide further leverage and funding for our 
        adversaries and continue to weaken global security; and
            (2) the energy independence of the United States is 
        critical to national security and should include the production 
        of all available energy sources, including coal, natural gas, 
        oil, nuclear, and renewables, as well as strategic minerals 
        critical to electric vehicles and other clean energy sources.

SEC. 3. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE LEVELS AND EMERGENCY SALES.

    (a) Studies and Assessment.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall submit to 
        the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of 
        Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
        Resources of the Senate a report containing--
                    (A) the results of a study of metrics that may be 
                used for determining the adequacy of the amounts of 
                petroleum products stored in the Strategic Petroleum 
                Reserve to support United States energy security 
                objectives, taking into consideration gross crude oil 
                imports, net crude oil imports, and refining capacity 
                and utilization, and a determination of which such 
                metrics are the most appropriate for such purpose;
                    (B) the results of a study and analysis of domestic 
                crude oil refining capacity (including technical 
                configuration of refineries, downstream charge 
                capacity, and atmospheric crude distillation units) and 
                issues relating to aging infrastructure that would 
                inhibit the ability to meet production demand, and any 
                recommendations for improvements; and
                    (C) an assessment of acquisition procedures and 
                identification of any provisions of Federal law or 
                regulation that either limit or prohibit accelerated 
                replenishment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
                necessary to maintain and support United States energy 
                security objectives.
            (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form, but may contain a classified 
        annex.

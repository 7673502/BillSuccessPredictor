SEC. 3. GENERAL FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution 
        of the United States, the States have the primary role in 
        establishing ``(t)he Times, Places and Manners of holding 
        Elections for Senators and Representatives'', while Congress 
        has a purely secondary role in this space and must restrain 
        itself from acting improperly and unconstitutionally.
            (2) Federal election legislation should never be the first 
        step and must never impose burdensome, unfunded Federal 
        mandates on State and local elections officials. When Congress 
        does speak, it must devote its efforts only to resolving highly 
        significant and substantial deficiencies to ensure the 
        integrity of our elections. State legislatures are the primary 
        venues to establish rules for governing elections and correct 
        most issues.
            (3) All eligible voters who wish to participate must have 
        the opportunity to vote, and all lawful votes must be counted.
            (4) States must balance appropriate election administration 
        structures and systems with accessible access to the ballot 
        box.
            (5) Political speech is protected speech.
            (6) The First Amendment protects the right of all Americans 
        to state their political views and donate money to the 
        candidates, causes, and organizations of their choice without 
        fear of retribution.
            (7) Redistricting decisions are best made at the State 
        level.
            (8) States must maintain the flexibility to determine the 
        best redistricting processes for the particular needs of their 
        citizens.
            (9) Congress has independent authority under the 
        Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-
        Sixth Amendments to ensure elections are conducted without 
        unlawful discrimination.
            (10) The Voting Rights Act, which is not anchored in 
        Article 1, Section 4 of the Constitution, has seen much success 
        since its first passage in 1965, and Congress should continue 
        to exercise its constitutional authority in this space as 
        appropriate.

               TITLE I--ELECTION ADMINISTRATION INTEGRITY

        Subtitle A--Findings Relating to Election Administration

SEC. 101. FINDINGS RELATING TO ELECTION ADMINISTRATION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
constitutional scholar Robert Natelson has done invaluable work with 
respect to the history and understanding of the Elections Clause.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Constitution reserves to the States the primary 
        authority to set election legislation and administer 
        elections--the ``times, places, and manner of holding of 
        elections''--and Congress' power in this space is purely 
        secondary to the States' power and is to be employed only in 
        the direst of circumstances. History, precedent, the Framers' 
        words, debates concerning ratification, the Supreme Court, and 
        the Constitution itself make it exceedingly clear that 
        Congress' power over elections is not unfettered.
            (2) The Framing Generation grappled with the failure of the 
        Articles of Confederation, which provided for only a weak 
        national government incapable of preserving the Union. Under 
        the Articles, the States had exclusive authority over Federal 
        elections held within their territory; but, given the 
        difficulties the national government had experienced with State 
        cooperation (e.g., the failure of Rhode Island to send 
        delegates to the Confederation Congress), the Federalists, 
        including Alexander Hamilton, were concerned with the 
        possibility that the States, in an effort to destroy the 
        Federal Government, simply might not hold elections or that an 
        emergency, such as an invasion or insurrection, might prevent 
        the operation of a State's government, leaving the Congress 
        without Members and the Federal Government unable to respond.
            (3) Quite plainly, Alexander Hamilton, a leading Federalist 
        and proponent of our Constitution, understood the Elections 
        Clause as serving only as a sort of emergency fail-safe, not as 
        a cudgel used to nationalize our elections process. Writing as 
        Publius to the people of New York, Hamilton further expounds on 
        the correct understanding of the Elections Clause: ``T[he] 
        natural order of the subject leads us to consider, in this 
        place, that provision of the Constitution which authorizes the 
        national legislature to regulate, in the last resort, the 
        election of its own members.''. Alexander Hamilton (writing as 
        Publius), Federalist no. 59, Concerning the Power of Congress 
        to Regulate the Election of Members, N.Y. PACKET (Fri., Feb. 
        22, 1788).
            (4) When questioned at the States' constitutional ratifying 
        conventions with respect to this provision, the Federalists 
        confirmed this understanding of a constitutionally limited, 
        secondary congressional power under Article 1, Section 4. 
        (``[C]onvention delegate James McHenry added that the risk to 
        the federal government [without a fail-safe provision] might 
        not arise from state malice: An insurrection or rebellion might 
        prevent a state legislature from administering an election.''); 
        (``An occasion may arise when the exercise of this ultimate 
        power of Congress may be necessary . . . if a state should be 
        involved in war, and its legislature could not assemble, (as 
        was the case of South Carolina and occasionally of some other 
        states, during the [Revolutionary] war).''); (``Sir, let it be 
        remembered that this power can only operate in a case of 
        necessity, after the factious or listless disposition of a 
        particular state has rendered an interference essential to the 
        salvation of the general government.''). See Robert G. 
        Natelson, The Original Scope of the Congressional Power to 
        Regulate Elections, 13 U. PA. J. CONST. L. 1, 12-13 (Nov. 
        2010).
            (5) John Jay made similar claims in New York. And, as 
        constitutional scholar Robert Natelson notes in his invaluable 
        article, The Original Scope of the Congressional Power to 
        Regulate Elections, ``Alexander Contee Hanson, a member of 
        Congress whose pamphlet supporting the Constitution proved 
        popular, stated flatly that Congress would exercise its times, 
        places, and manner authority only in cases of invasion, 
        legislative neglect or obstinate refusal to pass election laws 
        [providing for the election of Members of Congress], or if a 
        state crafted its election laws with a `sinister purpose' or to 
        injure the general government.'' Cementing his point, Hanson 
        goes further to decree, ``The exercise of this power must at 
        all times be so very invidious, that congress will not venture 
        upon it without some very cogent and substantial reason.''. 
        Alexander Contee Hanson (writing as Astrides), Remarks on the 
        Proposed Plan: 31 January, reprinted in John P. Kaminski, 
        Gaspare J. Saladino, and Richard Leffler (eds.), 3 Commentaries 
        on the Constitution, public and private 18 December 1787 to 31 
        January 1788 522-26 (1984).
            (6) In fact, had the alternate view of the Elections Clause 
        been accepted at the time of the Constitution's drafting--that 
        is, that it offers Congress unfettered power over Federal 
        elections-- it is likely that the Constitution would not have 
        been ratified or that an amendment to this language would have 
        been required.
            (7) Indeed, at least seven of the original 13 States--over 
        half and enough to prevent the Constitution from being 
        ratified--expressed specific concerns with the language of the 
        Elections Clause. See 1 Annals of Cong. 799 (1789), Joseph 
        Gales (ed.) (1834). However, ``[l]eading Federalists . . .'' 
        assured them ``. . . that, even without amendment, the 
        [Elections] Clause should be construed as limited to 
        emergencies''. Three States, New York, North Carolina, and 
        Rhode Island, specifically made their ratification contingent 
        on this understanding being made express. Ratification of the 
        Constitution by the State of New York (July 26, 1788) (``Under 
        these impressions and declaring that the rights aforesaid 
        cannot be abridged or violated, and the Explanations aforesaid 
        are consistent with the said Constitution, And in confidence 
        that the Amendments which have been proposed to the said 
        Constitution will receive early and mature Consideration: We 
        the said Delegates, in the Name and in [sic] the behalf of the 
        People of the State of New York Do by these presents Assent to 
        and Ratify the said Constitution. In full Confidence . . . that 
        the Congress will not make or alter any Regulation in this 
        State respecting the times places and manner of holding 
        Elections for Senators or Representatives unless the 
        Legislature of this State shall neglect or refuse to make laws 
        or regulations for the purpose, or from any circumstance be 
        incapable of making the same, and that in those cases such 
        power will only be exercised until the Legislature of this 
        State shall make provision in the Premises''); Ratification of 
        the Constitution by the State of North Carolina (Nov. 21, 1789) 
        (``That Congress shall not alter, modify, or interfere in the 
        times, places, or manner of holding elections for senators and 
        representatives, or either of them, except when the legislature 
        of any state shall neglect, refuse or be disabled by invasion 
        or rebellion, to prescribe the same.''); Ratification of the 
        Constitution by the State of Rhode Island (May 29, 1790) 
        (``Under these impressions, and declaring, that the rights 
        aforesaid cannot be abridged or violated, and that the 
        explanations aforesaid, are consistent with the said 
        constitution, and in confidence that the amendments hereafter 
        mentioned, will receive an early and mature consideration, and 
        conformably to the fifth article of said constitution, speedily 
        become a part thereof; We the said delegates, in the name, and 
        in [sic] the behalf of the People, of the State of Rhode-Island 
        and Providence-Plantations, do by these Presents, assent to, 
        and ratify the said Constitution. In full confidence . . . That 
        the Congress will not make or alter any regulation in this 
        State, respecting the times, places and manner of holding 
        elections for senators and representatives, unless the 
        legislature of this state shall neglect, or refuse to make laws 
        or regulations for the purpose, or from any circumstance be 
        incapable of making the same; and that [i]n those cases, such 
        power will only be exercised, until the legislature of this 
        State shall make provision in the Premises[.]'').
            (8) Congress finds that the Framers designed and the 
        ratifying States understood the Elections Clause to serve 
        solely as a protective backstop to ensure the preservation of 
        the Federal Government, not as a font of limitless power for 
        Congress to wrest control of Federal elections from the States.
            (9) This understanding was also reinforced by debate during 
        the first Congress that convened under the Constitution where 
        Representative Aedanus Burke proposed a constitutional 
        amendment to limit the Times, Places and Manner Clause to 
        emergencies. Although the amendment failed, those on both sides 
        of the Burke amendment debate already understood the Elections 
        Clause to limit Federal elections power to emergencies.
            (10) History clearly shows that even in the first Congress 
        that convened under the Constitution, it was acknowledged and 
        understood through the debates that ensued over the Elections 
        Clause provision that Congress' control over elections is 
        limited.
            (11) Similarly, proponent Representative Smith of South 
        Carolina also believed the original text of the Elections 
        Clause already limited the Federal Government's power over 
        Federal elections to emergencies and so thought there would be 
        no harm in supporting an amendment to make that language 
        express. Annals of Congress 801 (1789) Joseph Gales Edition. A 
        Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional 
        Documents and Debates, 1774-1875 (loc.gov). So, even the 
        records of the First Congress reflect a recognition of the 
        emergency nature of congressional power over Federal elections.
            (12) Similarly, the Supreme Court has supported this 
        understanding. In Smiley v. Holm, the Court held that Article 
        1, Section 4 of the Constitution reserved to the States the 
        primary ``. . . authority to provide a complete code for 
        congressional elections, not only as to times and places, but 
        in relation to notices, registration, supervision of voting, 
        protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt 
        practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and 
        canvassers, and making and publication of election returns; in 
        short, to enact the numerous requirements as to procedure and 
        safeguards which experience shows are necessary in order to 
        enforce the fundamental right involved. And these requirements 
        would be nugatory if they did not have appropriate sanctions in 
        the definition of offenses and punishments. All this is 
        comprised in the subject of `times, places and manner of 
        holding elections', and involves lawmaking in its essential 
        features and most important aspect.''. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U.S. 
        355, 366 (1932).
            (13) This holding is consistent with the understanding of 
        the Elections Clause since the framing of the Constitution. The 
        Smiley Court also held that while Congress maintains the 
        authority to ``. . . supplement these state regulations or [to] 
        substitute its own[]'', such authority remains merely ``a 
        general supervisory power over the whole subject.''. Id.
            (14) More recently, the Court noted in Arizona v. Inter-
        Tribal Council of Ariz., Inc. that ``[t]his grant of 
        congressional power [that is, the fail-safe provision in the 
        Elections Clause] was the Framers' insurance against the 
        possibility that a State would refuse to provide for the 
        election of representatives to the Federal Congress.''. Arizona 
        v. Inter-Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1, 7-9 
        (2013). The Court explained that the Elections Clause ``. . . 
        imposes [upon the States] the duty . . . to prescribe the time, 
        place, and manner of electing Representatives and 
        Senators[.]''. Id. at 8. And, while, as the Court noted, 
        ``[t]he power of Congress over the `Times, Places, and Manner' 
        of congressional elections is paramount, and may be exercised 
        at any time, and to any extent which it deems expedient; and so 
        far as it is exercised, and no farther, the regulations 
        effected supersede those of the State which are inconsistent 
        therewith[]'', id. at 9, the Inter-Tribal Court explained, 
        quoting extensively from the Federalist no. 59, that it was 
        clear that the congressional fail-safe included in the 
        Elections Clause was intended for the sorts of governmental 
        self-preservation discussed here: ``[E]very government ought to 
        contain in itself the means of its own preservation[.]''; 
        ``[A]n exclusive power of regulating elections for the national 
        government, in the hands of the State legislatures, would leave 
        the existence of the Union entirely at their mercy. They could 
        at any moment annihilate it by neglecting to provide for the 
        choice of persons to administer its affairs.''. Id. at 8.
            (15) It is clear in every respect that the congressional 
        fail-safe described in the Elections Clause vests purely 
        secondary authority over Federal elections in the Federal 
        legislative branch and that the primary authority rests with 
        the States. Congressional authority is intended to be, and as a 
        matter of constitutional fact is, limited to addressing the 
        worst imaginable issues, such as invasion or other matters that 
        might lead to a State not electing representatives to 
        constitute the two Houses of Congress. Congress' authority has 
        never extended to the day-to-day authority over the ``Times, 
        Places and Manner of Election'' that the Constitution clearly 
        reserves to the States.
            (16) Congress must act within the bounds of its 
        constitutional authority when enacting legislation concerning 
        the administration of our Nation's elections.

       Subtitle C--Requirements To Promote Integrity in Election 
                             Administration

SEC. 121. ENSURING ONLY ELIGIBLE AMERICAN CITIZENS MAY PARTICIPATE IN 
              FEDERAL ELECTIONS.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Non-citizens: 
Outlawed from Voting in Our Trusted Elections Act of 2022'' or the ``NO 
VOTE for Non-Citizens Act of 2022''.
    (b) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Every eligible person who wishes to cast a 
                ballot in a Federal election must be permitted to do so 
                according to law, and their ballot must be examined 
                according to law, and, if it meets all lawful 
                requirements, counted.
                    (B) Congress has long required States to maintain 
                Federal voter registration lists in a manner that 
                promotes voter confidence.
                    (C) The changes included herein are not intended to 
                be an expansion of Federal power but rather a 
                clarification of State authority.
                    (D) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth 
                Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and the Twenty-
                Sixth Amendment, among other references, make clear 
                that the Constitution prohibits voting by non-citizens 
                in Federal elections.
                    (E) Congress has the constitutional authority, 
                including under the aforementioned amendments, to pass 
                statutes preventing non-citizens from voting in Federal 
                elections, and did so with the Illegal Immigration 
                Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.
                    (F) Congress may further exercise its 
                constitutional authority to ensure the Constitution's 
                prohibition on non-citizen voting in Federal elections 
                is upheld.
                    (G) Since the Constitution prohibits non-citizens 
                from voting in Federal elections, such ineligible 
                persons must not be permitted to be placed on Federal 
                voter registration lists.
                    (H) Improper placement of an ineligible non-citizen 
                on a Federal voter registration list leads to--
                            (i) confusion on the part of the ineligible 
                        person with respect to their ineligibility to 
                        cast a ballot; and
                            (ii) an increased likelihood that human 
                        error will permit ineligible persons to cast 
                        ballots in Federal elections.
                    (I) State officials have confirmed that poorly 
                maintained voter registration lists lead to ineligible 
                persons casting ballots in Federal elections.
                    (J) A former Broward County, Florida, elections 
                supervisor has confirmed that ineligible non-voters 
                were able to cast ballots in previous elections and 
                that she was not able to locate as many as 2,040 
                ballots during the 2018 midterm recount.
                    (K) This clarification of State authority to 
                maintain Federal voter registration lists to ensure 
                non-citizens are not included on such lists will 
                promote voter confidence in election processes and 
                outcomes.
                    (L) Congress has the authority to ensure that no 
                Federal elections funding is used to support States 
                that permit non-citizens to cast ballots in any 
                election.
                    (M) Federal courts and executive agencies have much 
                of the information States may need to maintain their 
                Federal voter registration lists, and those entities 
                should make that information accessible to State 
                election authorities.
                    (N) It is important to clarify the penalty for any 
                violation of law that allows a non-citizen to cast a 
                ballot in a Federal election.
                    (O) To protect the confidence of voters in Federal 
                elections, it is important to implement the policy 
                described herein.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) many States have not adequately met the 
                requirements concerning the removal of ineligible 
                persons from State voter registration rolls pursuant to 
                section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 
                1993 (52 U.S.C. 20507) and should strive to audit and 
                update their voter registration rolls on a routine 
                basis;
                    (B) allowing non-citizens to cast ballots in 
                American elections weakens our electoral system and the 
                value of citizenship and sows distrust in our elections 
                system;
                    (C) even if a State has the sovereign authority, no 
                State should permit non-citizens to cast ballots in 
                State or local elections;
                    (D) States should use all information available to 
                them to maintain Federal voter registration lists and 
                should inform Congress if such data is insufficient; 
                and
                    (E) Congress may take further action in the future 
                to address this problem.
    (c) Clarifying Authority of States To Remove Non-Citizens From 
Voting Rolls.--
            (1) Authority under regular removal programs.--Section 
        8(a)(4) of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 
        U.S.C. 20507(a)(4)) is amended--
                    (A) by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph 
                (A);
                    (B) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as 
                subparagraph (C); and
                    (C) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the 
                following new subparagraph:
                    ``(B) the registrant's status as a noncitizen of 
                the United States; or''.
            (2) Conforming amendment relating to ongoing removal.--
        Section 8(c)(2)(B)(i) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 20507(c)(2)(B)(i)) 
        is amended by striking ``(4)(A)'' and inserting ``(4)(A) or 
        (B)''.
    (d) Requirement To Maintain Separate State Voter Registration List 
for Non-Citizens.--Section 8(a) of the National Voter Registration Act 
of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20507(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (5)(B), by striking ``and'' at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and 
        inserting ``; and''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(7) in the case of a State that allows individuals who 
        are not citizens of the United States to vote in elections for 
        public office in the State or any local jurisdiction of the 
        State, ensure that the name of any registrant who is not a 
        citizen of the United States is maintained on a voter 
        registration list that is separate from the official list of 
        eligible voters with respect to registrants who are citizens of 
        the United States.''.
    (e) Requirements for Ballots for State or Local Jurisdictions That 
Allow Non-Citizen Voting.--Section 301(a)(1) of the Help America Vote 
Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following new subparagraph:
                    ``(D) In the case of a State or local jurisdiction 
                that allows individuals who are not citizens of the 
                United States to vote in elections for public office in 
                the State or local jurisdiction, the ballot used for 
                the casting of votes by a noncitizen in such State or 
                local jurisdiction may only include the candidates for

American Confidence in Elections Act) in a State or local jurisdiction 
that allows individuals who are not citizens of the United States to 
vote in elections for public office in the State or local 
jurisdiction.''.

        is amended by adding at the end the following new item:

        official of the State, provide that information to the election 
        official.
            (2) Policies and procedures.--Consistent with section

        amended--

        court recuses an individual from serving on a jury on the

    Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (52 U.S.C.

            (1) in subsection (i), by adding at the end the following:

        include a requirement that the applicant provide proof that the 
        applicant is a citizen of the United States'' after ``elections 
        for Federal office''.

SEC. 124. PROVISION OF PHOTOGRAPHIC CITIZEN VOTER IDENTIFICATION TOOLS 
              FOR STATE USE.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Citizen Vote 
Protection Act''.
    (b) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) Photo voter identification programs established 
                by the States should be administered without unlawful 
                discrimination and with an eye toward balancing 
                appropriate access to the ballot box with election 
                integrity and voter confidence goals.
                    (B) As confirmed by the bipartisan Commission on 
                Federal Election Reform (commonly known as the Carter-
                Baker Commission), ``[v]oters in nearly 100 democracies 
                use a photo identification card without fear of 
                infringement of their rights''.
                    (C) As confirmed by the Carter-Baker Commission, 
                ``[t]he right to vote is a vital component of U.S. 
                citizenship and all States should use their best 
                efforts to obtain proof of citizenship before 
                registering voters.''.
                    (D) The Carter-Baker Commission was correct in its 
                2005 report when it recommended that the REAL ID Act be 
                ``modestly adapted for voting purposes to indicate on 
                the front or back whether the individual is a U.S. 
                citizen.''.
                    (E) Congress acknowledges the important work 
                completed by the Carter-Baker Commission and, by 
                amending the REAL ID Act, resolves the concerns in the 
                Commission's report that ``[t]he REAL ID Act does not 
                require that the card indicates citizenship, but that 
                would need to be done if the card is to be used for 
                voting purposes''.
                    (F) Photographic voter identification is important 
                for ensuring voter confidence in election processes and 
                outcomes.
                    (G) Requiring photographic voter identification is 
                well within States' constitutional competence, 
                including pursuant to the Qualifications Clause of the 
                Constitution of the United States (article I, section 
                2, clause 2), the Presidential Electors Clause of the 
                Constitution (article II, section 1, clause 2), and the 
                Seventeenth Amendment.
                    (H) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth 
                Amendment, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and the Twenty-
                Sixth Amendment, among other references, make clear 
                that the Constitution prohibits voting by non-citizens 
                in Federal elections.
                    (I) Congress has the constitutional authority, 
                including under the aforementioned amendments, to pass 
                statutes preventing non-citizens from voting in Federal 
                elections, and did so with the Illegal Immigration 
                Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.
                    (J) Congress may further exercise its 
                constitutional authority to ensure the Constitution's 
                prohibition on non-citizen voting in Federal elections 
                is upheld.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        the States should implement the substance of the recommendation 
        of the Carter-Baker Commission that, ``[t]o ensure that persons 
        presenting themselves at the polling place are the ones on the 
        registration list, the Commission recommends that states 
        [encourage] voters to use the REAL ID card, which was mandated 
        in a law signed by the President in May 2005''.
    (c) REAL ID Act Amendment.--
            (1) Amendment.--Section 202(b) of the Real ID Act of 2005 
        (49 U.S.C. 30301 note) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following new paragraph:
            ``(10) If the person is a citizen of the United States, an 
        indication of that citizenship, except that no other 
        information may be included with respect to the immigration 
        status of the person.''.
            (2) Applicability.--The amendment made by this subsection 
        shall be effective January 1, 2026, and shall apply with 
        respect to any driver's license or identification card issued 
        by a State on and after such date.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or in any 
amendment made by this section may be construed to establish or mandate 
the use of a national identification card or to authorize any office of 
the executive branch to establish or mandate the use of a national 
identification card.

SEC. 125. MANDATORY PROVISION OF IDENTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN VOTERS NOT 
              VOTING IN PERSON.

    (a) Requiring Voters To Provide Identification.--Title III of the 
Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.) is amended--

        and 306; and
            (2) by inserting after section 303 the following new 
        section:

``SEC. 304. MANDATORY PROVISION OF IDENTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN VOTERS 
              WHO VOTE BY MAIL.

    ``(a) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds that it 
has the authority to establish the terms and conditions that States 
must follow with respect to the administration of voting by mail 
because article I, section 8, clause 7 of the Constitution of the 
United States and other enumerated powers grant Congress the power to 
regulate the operations of the United States Postal Service.
    ``(b) Requiring Provision of Identification To Receive a Ballot or 
Vote in Certain Cases.--
            ``(1) Individuals requesting a ballot to vote by mail.--
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the appropriate 
        State or local election official may not provide an individual 
        a ballot to vote by mail for an election for Federal office in 
        a case in which the individual requested such ballot other than 
        in person from the appropriate State or local election official 
        of the State at a State designated elections office unless the 
        individual submits with the application for the ballot a copy 
        of an identification described in paragraph (3).
            ``(2) Individuals voting by mail in certain cases.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, in a case in which the appropriate 
                State or local election official provides an individual 
                a ballot to vote by mail for an election for Federal 
                office without requiring such individual to submit a 
                separate application or request to receive such ballot 
                for each such election, the election official may not 
                accept the voted ballot unless the individual submits 
                with the voted ballot a copy of an identification 
                described in paragraph (3).
                    ``(B) Fail-safe voting.--An individual who desires 
                to vote other than in person but who does not meet the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A) may cast such a ballot 
                other than in person and the ballot shall be counted as 
                a provisional ballot in accordance with section 302(a).
            ``(3) Identification described.--An identification 
        described in this paragraph is, with respect to an individual--
                    ``(A) a current and valid photo identification of

                card issued by a State or the identification number for

2024.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments Relating to Existing Identification 
Requirements.--
            (1) Treatment as individuals registering to vote by mail

SEC. 126. CONFIRMING ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Confirmation 
Of Congressional Observer Access Act of 2022'' or the ``COCOA Act of 
2022''.
    (b) Findings Relating to Congressional Election Observers.--
Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Constitution delegates to each of House of the 
        Congress the authority to ``be the Judge of the Elections, 
        Returns and Qualifications of its own Members''.
            (2) While, in general, Congress shall respect the 
        determination of State authorities with respect to the election 
        of members to each House, each House of Congress serves as the 
        final arbiter over any contest to the seating of any putative 
        Member-elect or Senator-elect.
            (3) These election contest procedures are contained in the 
        precedents of each House of Congress. Further, for the House of 
        Representatives the procedures exist under the Federal 
        Contested Elections Act.
            (4) In the post-Civil War modern era, more than 100 
        election contests have been filed with the House of 
        Representatives.
            (5) For decades, Congress has appointed and sent out 
        official congressional observers to watch the administration of 
        congressional elections in the States and territories.
            (6) These observers serve to permit Congress to develop its 
        own factual record in preparation for eventual contests and for 
        other reasons.
            (7) This section and the amendments made by this section do 
        not establish any new authorities or procedures but are 
        provided simply to permit a convenient statutory reference for 
        existing Congressional authority and activity.
    (c) Confirming Requirement That States Provide Access.--Title III 
of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081 et seq.), as 
amended by section 125(a), is amended--
            (1) by redesignating sections 305 and 306 as sections 306 
        and 307; and
            (2) by inserting after section 304 the following new 
        section:

``SEC. 305. CONFIRMING ACCESS FOR CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION OBSERVERS.

    ``(a) Finding of Constitutional Authority.--Congress finds that it 
has the authority to require that States allow access to designated 
Congressional election observers to observe the election administration 
procedures in an election for Federal office because the authority 
granted to Congress under article I, section 5 of the Constitution of 
the United States gives each House of Congress the power to be the 
judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of its own Members.
    ``(b) Requiring States To Provide Access.--A State shall provide 
each individual who is a designated Congressional election observer for 
an election with full access to clearly observe all of the elements of 
the administration procedures with respect to such election, including 
but not limited to in all areas of polling places and other facilities 
where ballots in the election are processed, tabulated, cast, 
canvassed, and certified, in all areas where voter registration 
activities occur before such election, and in any other such place 
where election administration procedures to prepare for the election or 
carry out any post-election recounts take place. No designated 
Congressional election observer may handle ballots, elections equipment 
(voting or non-voting), advocate for a position or candidate, take any 
action to reduce ballot secrecy, or otherwise interfere with the 
elections administration process.
    ``(c) Designated Congressional Election Observer Described.--In 
this section, a `designated Congressional election observer' is an 
individual who is designated in writing by the chair or ranking 
minority member of the Committee on House Administration of the House 
of Representatives or the Committee on Rules and Administration of the 
Senate, or the successor committee in either House of Congress to 
gather information with respect to an election, including in the event 
that the election is contested in the House of Representatives or the 
Senate and for other purposes permitted by article 1, section 5 of the 
Constitution of the United States.''.
    (d) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section 401 of 
such Act (52 U.S.C. 21111), as amended by section 125(c), is amended by 
striking ``and 304'' and inserting ``304, and 305''.

amended by section 125(d), is amended--
            (1) by redesignating the items relating to sections 305 and 
        306 as relating to sections 306 and 307; and
            (2) by inserting after the item relating to section 304 the 
        following:

SEC. 127. USE OF REQUIREMENTS PAYMENTS FOR POST-ELECTION AUDITS.

    Section 251(b)(1) of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 
21001(b)(1)) is amended by inserting ``, including to conduct and 
publish an audit of the effectiveness and accuracy of the voting

    ``(a) In General.--Gross income shall not include qualified

        any instrumentality of a State or any political subdivision 
        thereof, for the service of an individual as an election 
        official or election worker (within the meaning of section 
        3121(b)(7)(F)(iv)), paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied without

described in subsection (a) has been met with respect to such 
individual shall be determined by not taking into account--
            ``(1) any such payment which is qualified election worker

        exceed the limitation described in section 139I(b), and

        writ of certiorari at the instance of such appellant, and the 
        review on appeal shall be restricted to the Federal questions 
        presented.''.

SEC. 134. CLARIFICATION OF FEDERAL AGENCY INVOLVEMENT IN VOTER 
              REGISTRATION ACTIVITIES.

    Executive Order 14019 (86 Fed. Reg. 13623; relating to promoting 
access to voting) shall have no force or effect to the extent that it 
is inconsistent with section 7 of the National Voter Registration Act 
of 1993 (52 U.S.C. 20506).

SEC. 135. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ELECTION 
              ADMINISTRATION IN STATES THAT PERMIT BALLOT HARVESTING.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``No Federal 
Funds for Ballot Harvesting Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the right to vote is a fundamental right of citizens of 
        the United States, as described by the Constitution of the 
        United States;
            (2) the Committee on House Administration of the House of 
        Representatives, which is charged with investigating election 
        irregularities, received reports through its official Election 
        Observer Program for the 2018 general election and the 2020 
        general election, as well as from other stakeholders, that 
        individuals other than voters themselves were depositing large 
        amounts of absentee ballots at polling places throughout 
        California and other States, a practice colloquially known as 
        ``ballot harvesting'';
            (3) the practice of ballot harvesting creates significant 
        vulnerabilities in the chain-of-custody of ballots because 
        individuals collecting ballots are not required to be 
        registered voters and are not required to identify themselves 
        at a voter's home, and the State does not track how many 
        ballots are harvested in an election;
            (4) in North Carolina, a congressional election was 
        invalidated due to fraud associated with ballot harvesting 
        committed by a political operative, and it is unlikely such 
        activity would have been detected were it not for the 
        prohibition against ballot harvesting in the State;
            (5) ballot harvesting invites electioneering activity at 
        home and weakens States' long-standing voter protection 
        procedures, which remain in place at polling locations, 
        creating the possibility of undue influence over voters by 
        political operatives and other bad actors; and
            (6) the Supreme Court of the United States has affirmed 
        State authority to restrict ballot harvesting (Brnovich v. 
        Democratic National Committee, 141 S. Ct. 2321 (2021)).
    (c) Prohibition on Federal Funds for Election Administration for 
States Allowing Collection and Transmission of Ballots by Certain Third 
Parties.--
            (1) In general.--The Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 
        U.S.C. 20901 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
        following new section:

``SEC. 908. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL FUNDS FOR ELECTION ADMINISTRATION 
              FOR STATES ALLOWING COLLECTION AND TRANSMISSION OF 
              BALLOTS BY CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES.

    ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
Federal funds may be used to administer any election for Federal office 
in a State unless the State has in effect a law that prohibits an 
individual from the knowing collection and transmission of a ballot in 
an election for Federal office that was mailed to another person, other 
than an individual described as follows:
            ``(1) An election official while engaged in official duties 
        as authorized by law.
            ``(2) An employee of the United States Postal Service or 
        other commercial common carrier engaged in similar activities 
        while engaged in duties authorized by law.
            ``(3) Any other individual who is allowed by law to collect 
        and transmit United States mail, while engaged in official 
        duties as authorized by law.
            ``(4) A family member, household member, or caregiver of 
        the person to whom the ballot was mailed.
    ``(b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, with respect to a 
person to whom the ballot was mailed:
            ``(1) The term `caregiver' means an individual who provides 
        medical or health care assistance to such person in a 
        residence, nursing care institution, hospice facility, assisted 
        living center, assisted living facility, assisted living home, 
        residential care institution, adult day health care facility,

            ``(2) The term `family member' means an individual who is 
        related to such person by blood, marriage, adoption or legal 
        guardianship.
            ``(3) The term `household member' means an individual who 
        resides at the same residence as such person.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of contents of such Act 
        is amended by adding at the end the following new item:

``Sec. 908. Prohibition on Federal funds for election administration 
                            for States allowing collection and 
                            transmission of ballots by certain third 
                            parties.''.

SEC. 136. CLARIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL ELECTION RECORD-KEEPING 
              REQUIREMENT.

amended by inserting `` including envelopes used to deliver ballots by

              ENSURE MAILING ADDRESSES.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Postmaster General shall, in coordination 
with the appropriate State executives of each State, carry out a 
program to identify and assign a mailing address to each home in each 
State that, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, does not have

        on election administration, providing grants, and testing and 
        certifying election equipment.
            (2) The American people are best served when Federal agency 
        election assistance is offered by a single agency with 
        expertise in this space. The Election Assistance Commission, 
        composed of four election experts from different political 
        parties, is best situated among the Federal Government agencies 
        to offer assistance services to citizens and to guide other 
        Federal agencies that have responsibilities in the elections 
        space. The Commission is also best suited to determine the 
        timing of the issuance of any advisories and to disburse all 
        appropriated election grant funding.
            (3) To this end, Congress finds that the Election 
        Assistance Commission should be viewed as the lead Federal 
        Government agency on all election administration matters, and 
        other Federal agencies operating in this space should look to 
        the Commission for guidance, direction, and support on election 
        administration-related issues.

                TITLE II--MILITARY VOTING ADMINISTRATION

            Subtitle A--Findings Relating to Military Voting

SEC. 201. FINDINGS RELATING TO MILITARY VOTING.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Participation in the voting process by Americans who 
        serve in the Armed Forces is vital to the future of the 
        Republic; however, due to the realities of service around the 
        globe and despite many best efforts, the Nation has not always 
        lived up to its commitment to servicemembers that their vote be 
        counted.
            (2) The Military and Overseas Empowerment (MOVE) Act made 
        great progress in solving problems with voting that many 
        servicemembers faced. Yet, for many, it is still difficult to 
        exercise the franchise, with many ballots not reaching State 
        elections officials until after the deadline, negating their 
        voice. After 13 years, Congress must address the remaining 
        issues.
            (3) Congress finds that it is a moral imperative of 
        national importance that every eligible American servicemember 
        has the opportunity to cast a ballot in each election and, not 
        only that such ballot be received in time to be counted, but 
        that it actually be counted according to law.

           Subtitle B--GAO Analysis on Military Voting Access

SEC. 211. GAO ANALYSIS AND REPORT ON EFFECTIVENESS OF FEDERAL 
              GOVERNMENT IN MEETING OBLIGATIONS TO PROMOTE VOTING 
              ACCESS FOR ABSENT UNIFORMED SERVICES VOTERS.

    (a) Analysis.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct an analysis with respect to the effectiveness of the Federal 
Government in carrying out its responsibilities under the Uniformed and 
Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (52 U.S.C. 20301 et seq.) to 
promote access to voting for absent uniformed services voters (as such 
term is defined in section 107 of such Act (52 U.S.C. 20310)).
    (b) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2023, the Comptroller 
General shall submit to the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on House Administration of the House of Representatives and 
the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules and 
Administration of the Senate a report that contains the results of the 
analysis required by subsection (a).

 TITLE III--PROTECTION OF POLITICAL SPEECH AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM

                Subtitle A--Protecting Political Speech

SEC. 301. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The structure of the Constitution and its amendments 
        represents the radical idea that any sovereign power exercised 
        by the Federal Government flows either directly from the people 
        or through the States they established to govern themselves. In 
        the words of the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, ``[t]he 
        enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not 
        be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the 
        people.'' ``The powers not delegated to the United States by 
        the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are 
        reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.''
            (2) Among the many freedoms it protects, the First 
        Amendment prevents Congress from making any law abridging the 
        freedom of speech, the right of the people peaceably to 
        assemble, or the right of the people to petition the Government 
        for the redress of grievances.
            (3) Any proposed Federal action concerning freedom of 
        speech, protest, or petition must start with an analysis of the 
        First Amendment. Congress must ask whether the proposed action 
        would abridge these freedoms, and any uncertainty must be 
        determined in favor of fewer restrictions on speech.
            (4) In particular, political speech, uttered in the 
        furtherance of self-government, must raise an even higher bar 
        to congressional abridgement. The mechanisms and media used to 
        offer political speech must realize the same protections.
            (5) As the Supreme Court has recognized, the Constitution 
        grants Congress only a very narrow interest in the regulation 
        of political speech, the prevention of corruption or the 
        appearance of corruption.
            (6) In order to uphold and effectuate the Constitution, any 
        Federal statute that goes beyond this interest must be 
        repealed, and Congress must exercise its Article 1 authorities 
        to do so.

SEC. 302. REPEAL OF LIMITS ON COORDINATED POLITICAL PARTY EXPENDITURES.

    (a) Repeal of Limits.--Section 315(d) of the Federal Election 
Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30116(d)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``may make expenditures'' and 
                inserting ``may make expenditures, including 
                coordinated expenditures,''; and
                    (B) by striking ``Federal office, subject to the 
                limitations contained in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) 
                of this subsection'' and inserting ``Federal office in 
                any amount''; and
            (2) by striking paragraphs (2), (3), (4), and (5).
    (b) Clarifying Treatment of Certain Party Communications as 
Coordinated Expenditures.--Section 315(d) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 
30116(d)), as amended by subsection (a), is amended by adding at the 
end the following new paragraph:
    ``(2) For purposes of this subsection, if a public communication 
paid for by a committee of a political party or its agent refers to a 
clearly identified House or Senate candidate and is publicly 
distributed or otherwise publicly disseminated in the clearly 
identified candidate's jurisdiction, the communication shall be treated 
as a coordinated expenditure in connection with the campaign of a 
candidate for purposes of this subsection.''.
    (c) Conforming Amendment Relating to Indexing.--Section 315(c) of 
such Act (52 U.S.C. 30116(c)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)(B)(i), by striking ``(d),''; and
            (2) in paragraph (2)(B)(i), by striking ``subsections (b) 
        and (d)'' and inserting ``subsection (b)''.
    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply with respect to elections held during 2024 or any succeeding 
year.

SEC. 303. REPEAL OF LIMIT ON AGGREGATE CONTRIBUTIONS BY INDIVIDUALS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that the Supreme Court of the United 
States in McCutcheon v. FEC, 572 U.S. 185 (2014) determined the 
biennial aggregate limits under section 315(a)(3) of the Federal 
Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(3)) to be 
unconstitutional.
    (b) Repeal.--Section 315(a) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 
1971 (52 U.S.C. 30116(a)) is amended by striking paragraph (3).
    (c) Conforming Amendments.--Section 315(c) of such Act (52 U.S.C. 
30116(c)) is amended by striking ``(a)(3),'' each place it appears in 
paragraph (1)(B)(i), (1)(C), and (2)(B)(ii).

SEC. 304. EQUALIZATION OF CONTRIBUTION LIMITS TO STATE AND NATIONAL 
              POLITICAL PARTY COMMITTEES.

    (a) In General.--Section 315(a)(1) of the Federal Election Campaign 
Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30116(a)(1)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``a national political 
        party'' and inserting ``a national or State political party'';
            (2) by adding ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B);
            (3) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``; or'' and inserting 
        a period; and
            (4) by striking subparagraph (D).
    (b) Contributions by Multicandidate Political Committees.--
            (1) In general.--Section 315(a)(2)(B) of such Act (52 
        U.S.C. 30116(a)(2)(B)) is amended by striking ``a national 
        political party'' and inserting ``a national or State political 
        party''.
            (2) Price index adjustment.--Section 315(c) of such Act (52 
        U.S.C. 30116(c)) is amended--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by adding at the end the 
                following new subparagraph:
    ``(D) In any calendar year after 2022--
            ``(i) a threshold established by subsection (a)(2) shall be 
        increased by the percent difference determined under 
        subparagraph (A);
            ``(ii) each amount so increased shall remain in effect for 
        the calendar year; and
            ``(iii) if any amount after adjustment under clause (i) is 
        not a multiple of $100, such amount shall be rounded to the 
        nearest multiple of $100.''; and
                    (B) in paragraph (2)(B)--
                            (i) in clause (i), by striking ``and'' at 
                        the end;
                            (ii) in clause (ii), by striking the period 
                        at the end and inserting ``; and''; and

Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 30125(b)(2)) is

SEC. 306. PARTICIPATION IN JOINT FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES BY MULTIPLE 
              POLITICAL COMMITTEES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) While Federal law permits the Federal Election 
        Commission to engage in certain ``gap-filling'' activities as 
        it administers the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, the 
        regulations promulgated by the Federal Election Commission to 
        govern joint fundraising activities of multiple political 
        committees are not tied specifically to any particular 
        provision of the Act, and while these regulations generally 
        duplicate the provisions of the Act, they also impose 
        additional and unnecessary burdens on political committees 
        which seek to engage in joint fundraising activities, such as a 
        requirement for written agreements between the participating 
        committees.
            (2) It is therefore not necessary at this time to direct 
        the Federal Election Commission to repeal the existing 
        regulations which govern joint fundraising activities of 
        multiple political committees, as some political committees may 
        have reasons for following the provisions of such regulations 
        which impose additional and unnecessary burdens on these 
        activities.
    (b) Criteria for Participation in Joint Fundraising Activities.--
Section 302 of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (52 U.S.C. 
30102) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(j) Criteria for Participation in Joint Fundraising Activities by 
Multiple Political Committees.--
            ``(1) Criteria described.--Two or more political committees 
        as defined in this Act may participate in joint fundraising 
        activities in accordance with the following criteria:
                    ``(A) The costs of the activities shall be 
                allocated among and paid for by the participating 
                committees on the basis of the allocation among the 
                participating committees of the contributions received 
                as a result of the activities.
                    ``(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a 
                participating committee may make a payment (in whole or 
                in part) for the portion of the costs of the activities 
                which is allocated to another participating committee, 
                and the amount of any such payment shall be treated as 
                a contribution made by the committee to the other 
                participating committee.
                    ``(C) The provisions of section 315(a)(8) regarding 
                the treatment of contributions to a candidate which are 
                earmarked or otherwise directed through an intermediary 
                or conduit shall apply to contributions made by a 
                person to a participating committee which are allocated 
                by the committee to another participating committee.
            ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection may 
        be construed to prohibit two or more political committees from 
        participating in joint fundraising activities by designating or 
        establishing a separate, joint committee subject to the 
        registration and reporting requirements of this Act or by 
        publishing a joint fundraising notice.''.

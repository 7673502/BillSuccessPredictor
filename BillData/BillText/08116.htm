                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
           heavy trucks and trailers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Modern, Clean, and Safe Trucks Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

     Congress finds that--
            (1) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax on certain new 
        heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers, coupled with new 
        regulatory mandates, significantly increases the cost of new 
        heavy-duty trucks, tractors, and trailers and discourages the 
        replacement of older, less environmentally clean and less fuel 
        economical vehicles;
            (2) this 12-percent Federal retail excise tax is the 
        highest percentage rate of any Federal ad valorem excise tax;
            (3) the Federal excise tax was first levied by Congress in 
        1917 to help finance America's involvement in World War I;
            (4) the 12-percent Federal retail excise tax routinely adds 
        between $12,000 and $22,000 to the cost of a new heavy truck, 
        tractor, or trailer;
            (5) more than half of the Class 8 trucks on the road are 
        over 10 years old and lack a decade of environmental and safety 
        technological advancements;
            (6) since 2007, new trucks have reduced carbon dioxide 
        emissions by 202 million tons, nitrogen oxide emissions by 27 
        million tons, and saved 20 billion gallons of diesel and 472 
        million barrels of crude oil;
            (7) an owner of a single Class 8 truck powered by the 
        latest clean diesel engine can expect to save about 2,200 
        gallons of fuel each year compared to previous generations of 
        technology;
            (8) over the past 3 decades, cleaner fuel and advanced 
        engines have combined to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions 
        by 97 percent and particulate matter (PM) emissions by 98 
        percent;
            (9) the Federal excise tax disproportionately impacts 
        electric and alternative-fueled trucks, which currently have a 
        higher up front cost, at a time when adoption of these 
        technologies is needed to accelerate the transition to zero 
        emission vehicles and the reduction of carbon pollution from 
        transportation;
            (10) there are approximately 1,300,000 United States 
        manufacturing, supplier, dealership, and heavy-duty trucking 
        and trailer related jobs;
            (11) since the Federal retail excise tax on certain new 
        heavy trucks, tractors, and trailers is based on annual sales, 
        receipts from the tax deposited in the Highway Trust Fund can 
        vary greatly;
            (12) Congress should consider a more reliable and 
        consistent revenue mechanism to fund the Highway Trust Fund;
            (13) Congress should advance the deployment of the most 
        modern, clean, and safe trucks through eliminating the Federal 
        excise tax on trucks; and
            (14) repealing the Federal excise tax would result in the 
        replacement of older internal combustion engine trucks with new 
        heavy duty trucks that employ the latest safety and 
        environmental technologies.

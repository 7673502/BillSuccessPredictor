    The Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall

Licensing Grant Program'' to provide eligible entities funds to develop 
and implement equitable cannabis licensing programs that minimize 
barriers to cannabis licensing and employment for individuals most 
adversely impacted by the war on drugs, provided that each grantee 
includes at least four of the six of the following elements in its 
licensing program:
            (1) A waiver of cannabis license application fees for 
        individuals most adversely impacted by the war on drugs who are 
        first-time applicants.
            (2) A prohibition on the denial of a cannabis license based 
        on a conviction of a cannabis-related offense.
            (3) A prohibition on criminal conviction restrictions for 
        licensing except in instances where the conviction is relevant 
        to owning and operating a business.
            (4) A prohibition on cannabis license holders from engaging 
        in suspicion less cannabis drug testing of their prospective or 
        current employees, except in instances of drug testing for 
        safety-sensitive positions as defined by the Omnibus 
        Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-
        143).
            (5) The establishment of a cannabis licensing board, that 
        is reflective of the racial, ethnic, economic, and gender 
        composition of the State or locality, to serve as an oversight 
        body of the equitable licensing program.
            (6) The establishment of a grant program from cannabis tax 
        revenue to support non-profit community-based organizations 
        that provide business training and technical, management, and 
        marketing assistance to individuals most adversely impacted by 
        the war on drugs who are starting, sustaining, or expanding a 
        cannabis business.

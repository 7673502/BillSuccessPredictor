                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 10, United States Code, to establish a separation oath 
   for members of the Armed Forces who are separating from military 
                                service.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Oath of Exit Act''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF SEPARATION OATH FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED 
              FORCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States Armed Forces is the largest, all-
        volunteer military force in the world, yet less than one 
        percent of the American population serves in the Armed Forces.
            (2) Each branch of the Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, 
        Marine Corps, Space Force, and Coast Guard) instills in its 
        members a sense of duty and obligation to the United States, 
        their branch of service, and their comrades-in-arms.
            (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that 
        approximately 20 veterans of the Armed Forces commit suicide 
        each day, and a veteran's risk of suicide is 21 percent higher 
        than an adult who has not served in the Armed Forces.
            (4) The Department of Veterans Affairs is aggressively 
        undertaking measures to prevent these tragic outcomes, yet 
        suicide rates among veterans remain unacceptably high.
            (5) Upon enlistment or appointment in the Armed Forces, a 
        new member is obligated to take an oath of office or oath of 
        enlistment.
            (6) Most members of the Armed Forces view this oath not as 
        an imposition, but as a promise that they are bound to fulfill.
    (b) Establishment of Separation Oath.--Section 502 of title 10, 
United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``The oath'' and 
        inserting ``An oath established by this section'';
            (2) by redesignating subsection (b), as amended, as 
        subsection (c); and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (a) the following new 
        subsection (b):
    ``(b) Separation Oath.--Prior to retirement or other separation 
from the armed forces, other than separation pursuant to the sentence 
of a court-martial, a member of an armed force may take the following 
oath:
            ```I, __________, recognizing that my oath to support and 
        defend the Constitution of the United States against all 
        enemies, foreign and domestic, has involved me and my fellow 
        members in experiences that few persons, other than our peers, 
        can understand, do solemnly swear (or affirm) to continue to be 
        the keeper of my brothers- and sisters-in-arms and protector of 
        the United States and the Constitution; to preserve the values 
        I have learned; to maintain my body and my mind; to give help 
        to, and seek help from, my fellow veterans; and to not bring 
        harm to myself or others. I take this oath freely and without 
        purpose of evasion, so help me God.'''.
    (c) Clerical Amendments.--
            (1) Section heading.--The heading of section 502 of title 
        10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 502. Enlistment oath and separation oath: who may administer''.
            (2) Table of sections.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of chapter 31 of title 10, United States Code, is 
        amended by striking the item relating to section 502 and 
        inserting the following new item:

``502. Enlistment oath and separation oath: who may administer.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

                                 A BILL


 
To require an investigation into all non-natural deaths of journalists 
   in a foreign nation, who are United States citizens or working on 
   behalf of a United States-based news media entity, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Justice For Journalists Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Without free speech and a free press, the United States 
        would not be the country it is. Along with diplomacy and 
        military strength, a free press, or the Fourth Estate, is 
        another avenue to challenge the status quo and be a voice for 
        the protection of the rule of law, civil society, and human 
        rights.
            (2) While journalists hold the most public facing position, 
        a free press is comprised of a breadth of ``media workers''. 
        Today, the fields associated with providing information about 
        current events or events of current interest to the public, 
        include photographers, videographers, publishers, editors, and 
        documentarians.
            (3) According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 60 
        journalists have been killed while reporting on wars and 
        humanitarian crisis around the world in 2022. Of the 60 
        journalists killed, 17 were murdered and the perpetrator had 
        complete impunity from the law. This number may rise as more 
        cases are solved.
            (4) The Geneva Convention protects journalists and media 
        workers in a variety of ways, under--
                    (A) the Fourth Geneva Convention, if they are not 
                nationals of the country holding them;
                    (B) Article 3 common to the four Geneva 
                Conventions, and by Additional Protocol II, and 
                customary international law, which protect journalists 
                in times of non-international armed conflict as 
                civilians; and
                    (C) Article 79 of Additional Protocol I, which 
                provides that journalists are entitled to all rights 
                and protections granted to civilians in international 
                armed conflicts. The same holds true in non-
                international armed conflicts by virtue of customary 
                international law.
            (5) As provided in Article 19 of the United Nations 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International 
        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, all people enjoy the 
        right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the 
        right to seek, receive, and impart information.
            (6) The United Nations Plan of Action defines the safety of 
        journalists as encompassing not only physical attacks but also 
        prosecution, arrest, imprisonment, and denial of journalistic 
        access, as well as impunity for crimes against journalists.
            (7) According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
        and Cultural Organization, 455 journalists were killed while 
        doing their jobs between 2016 and 2021. These cases include 
        deaths as a result of extrajudicial killings, targeted 
        terrorist attacks, and in conflicts. In more than 8 out of 10 
        cases, the perpetrators have not been brought to justice.
            (8) According to the United Nations, silencing journalists 
        by killing them is the most egregious form of censorship. The 
        failure of the State to prosecute and punish serious crimes 
        against journalists denies justice to the victims' families, 
        emboldens perpetrators, and can deter other journalists from 
        reporting high-risk stories. Countries with high rates of 
        impunity also have high rates of journalist fatalities, 
        underscoring the correlation between impunity and the 
        perpetuation of such crimes.
            (9) Strong advocacy from civil society and growing 
        awareness of the problem have led the United Nations Security 
        Council and the Human Rights Council to adopt a series of 
        resolutions calling for prompt and effective investigations 
        into attacks on journalists. In 2021, for the first time in the 
        context of international efforts to combat crime, States 
        recognized the importance of ending impunity for crimes against 
        journalists in General Assembly Resolution 76/181.
            (10) The United States, as a force for good in this world, 
        must defend and protect those who are committed to raising 
        awareness of the casualties of war, humanitarian crises, human 
        rights abuses, and corruption around the world.
            (11) The United States must preserve and build upon the 
        leadership of the United States on issues relating to freedom 
        of the press, on the basis of the protections afforded the 
        American people under the First Amendment.
            (12) The United States must conduct prompt and effective 
        investigations into all non-natural deaths of journalists and 
        representative of the news media in a foreign nation, who are 
        United States citizens or working on behalf of a United States-
        based news media entity.
            (13) The United States must improve the rapid 
        identification, publication, and response by the United States 
        Government to threats against freedom of the press around the 
        world, no matter a foreign nation's status as ally or 
        adversary.

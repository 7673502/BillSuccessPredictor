the enactment of this subsection).
    ``(2) If the condition under paragraph (1) is met, then any amounts

determined as follows:

``If the total amount of service     Then, the percentage allowable is:

        subsection is:
        Less than 4 years..................................         50

percent of all amounts received as overtime pay (as described in

performed on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, be 
treated as basic pay for purposes of computing--
            ``(A) an annuity under section 8452; and
            ``(B) a survivor annuity under subchapter IV, if based on 
        the service of an individual who dies before separating from 
        service.''.
            (2) Information.--Not less than once every year following 
        the date of enactment of this section, the United States 
        Capitol Police shall provide information to the Office of 
        Personnel Management for the purposes of carrying out this 
        section and the amendments made by this section, including 
        information used to determine the normal-cost percentage (as

        Code).

            (2) bolstering deterrence to preserve peace, security, and 
        stability across the Taiwan Strait; and
            (3) deepening interoperability with Taiwan in defense 
        capabilities, including in--
                    (A) maritime and air domain awareness; and
                    (B) integrated air and missile defense systems.

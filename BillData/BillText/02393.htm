    The Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended by adding after 
section 7 the following:

``SEC. 7A. OIL PRODUCING CARTELS.

    ``(a) In General.--It shall be illegal and a violation of this Act 
for any foreign state, or any instrumentality or agent of any foreign 
state, to act collectively or in combination with any other foreign 
state, any instrumentality or agent of any other foreign state, or any 
other person, whether by cartel or any other association or form of 
cooperation or joint action--
            ``(1) to limit the production or distribution of oil, 
        natural gas, or any other petroleum product;
            ``(2) to set or maintain the price of oil, natural gas, or 
        any petroleum product; or
            ``(3) to otherwise take any action in restraint of trade 
        for oil, natural gas, or any petroleum product,
when such action, combination, or collective action has a direct, 
substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect on the market, supply, 
price, or distribution of oil, natural gas, or other petroleum product 
in the United States.
    ``(b) Inapplicability of Defenses.--No court of the United States 
shall decline, based on the act of state, foreign sovereign compulsion, 
or political question doctrines to make a determination on the merits 
in an action brought under this section.
    ``(c) Enforcement.--The Attorney General of the United States shall 
have the sole authority to bring an action to enforce this section. Any 
such action shall be brought in any district court of the United States 
as provided under the antitrust laws.''.

                semicolon,
                    (B) in paragraph (6) by striking the period and 
                inserting ``; or'', and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(7) in which the action is brought under section 7A of 
        the Sherman Act.'', and
            (2) in section 1610(a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (7) by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``, or'', and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) the judgment relates to a claim that is brought under 
        section 7A of the Sherman Act.''.

SEC. 4. SEVERABILITY.

    If any provision of this Act (or of an amendment made by this Act) 
is held invalid the remainder of this Act (or of the amendment) shall 
not be affected thereby.

To amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to secure the supply 
  of critical energy resources, including critical minerals and other 
                   materials, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America's Critical Minerals 
Supply Act''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ORGANIZATION ACT.

    The Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.) 
is amended--
            (1) in section 2, by adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) As used in sections 102(20) and 203(a)(12), the term 
`critical energy resource' means any energy resource that--
            ``(1) is essential to the energy sector and energy systems 
        of the United States; and
            ``(2) the supply chain of which is vulnerable to 
        disruption.'';
            (2) in section 102, by adding at the end the following:
            ``(20) To ensure there is an adequate and reliable supply 
        of critical energy resources that are essential to the energy 
        security of the United States.''; and
            (3) in section 203(a), by adding at the end the following:
            ``(12) Functions that relate to securing the supply of 
        critical energy resources, including identifying and mitigating 
        the effects of a disruption of such supply on--
                    ``(A) the development and use of energy 
                technologies; and
                    ``(B) the operation of energy systems.''.

SEC. 3. SECURING CRITICAL ENERGY RESOURCE SUPPLY CHAINS.

    (a) In General.--In carrying out the requirements of the Department 
of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), the Secretary of 
Energy, in consultation with the appropriate Federal agencies, 
representatives of the energy sector, States, and other stakeholders, 
shall--
            (1) conduct ongoing assessments of--
                    (A) energy resource criticality based on the 
                importance of critical energy resources to the 
                development of energy technologies and the supply of 
                energy;
                    (B) the critical energy resource supply chain of 
                the United States; and
                    (C) the vulnerability of such supply chain;
            (2) strengthen critical energy resource supply chains in 
        the United States, including by--
                    (A) diversifying the sources of the supply of 
                critical energy resources; and
                    (B) increasing domestic production, separation, and 
                processing of critical energy resources;
            (3) develop substitutes and alternatives to critical energy 
        resources;
            (4) improve technology that reuses and recycles critical 
        energy resources; and
            (5) evaluate how the energy security of the United States 
        is affected by the reliance of the United States on importing 
        critical energy resources.
    (b) Critical Energy Resource Defined.--In this section, the term 
``critical energy resource'' has the meaning given such term in section 
2 of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101).
                                 &lt;all&gt;

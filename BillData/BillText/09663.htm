 To provide for United States participation in the Inter-Parliamentary 
                     Union, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Inter-Parliamentary 
Union Participation Act''.

SEC. 2. UNITED STATES PARTICIPATION IN THE INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), founded in 1889, 
        is the world organization of national parliaments comprising 
        179 parliaments (including all the major allies of the United 
        States) and working closely with the regional parliamentary 
        organizations on all continents.
            (2) The core mission of the IPU is the promotion of 
        parliamentary democracy, the elaboration of standards and 
        criteria for democratic parliamentary practice, the protection 
        of human rights, international peace and security, the 
        political empowerment of women, sustainable international 
        development, and greater transparency and accountability at the 
        global level, which are in line with United States interests 
        and priorities.
            (3) Congress was a founding member of the IPU, and played 
        an active and prominent role for many decades.
            (4) The main concerns of Congress, including the scheduling 
        of main assembly and arrears, have been fully addressed by the 
        IPU.
            (5) Through the activities of the IPU, the United States 
        can usefully promote its core values of freedom, democracy, and 
        human rights, and help build stronger parliaments around the 
        world.
    (b) United States Participation in the Inter-Parliamentary Union.--
Notwithstanding section 2503 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and 
Restructuring Act of 1998 (division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 
276 note)--
            (1) the Secretary of State is authorized to--
                    (A) facilitate the readmission and participation of 
                the United States in the Inter-Parliamentary Union; and
                    (B) pay expenses to meet the annual obligations of 
                membership in the Inter-Parliamentary Union, in 
                accordance with the assessments determined by the 
                Governing Council; and
            (2) the majority leader of the Senate, in consultation with 
        the minority leader of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House 
        of Representatives, in consultation with the minority leader of 
        the House of Representatives, are authorized to designate 
        Members of Congress to serve as delegates to the Assembly of 
        the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
    (c) Expenses of Delegation.--Of amounts made available pursuant to 
Public Law 100-202, as amended by subsection (d), up to $150,000 is 
authorized to be appropriated in fiscal year 2022 and each fiscal year 
thereafter to assist in meeting the expenses of the United States 
delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union in accordance with this 
Act.
    (d) Permanent Appropriation.--Section 303 of Public Law 100-202 is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``$620,000'' and inserting ``$1,500,000''; 
        and
            (2) by inserting ``section 2(b) of the United States Inter-
        Parliamentary Union Participation Act,'' after ``section 2(2) 
        of Public Law 84-689,''.

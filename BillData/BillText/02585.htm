        National Forest System lands, the Secretary of Agriculture, 
        acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, shall complete

        required under paragraph (1), the Secretary of Agriculture 
        shall give priority to National Forest System lands in the

                            (i) a timber sale described in subparagraph 
                        (A)(i) or a stewardship contract described in 
                        subparagraph (A)(ii) is planned; and
                            (ii) with respect to such sale or contract, 
                        an environmental decision document has been

                        National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
                        U.S.C. 4332).
    (b) Conversion of Timber Sales.--
            (1) Timber sales to salvage sales.--Not later than 60 days 
        after a wildfire is contained on National Forest System lands, 
        the Secretary of Agriculture shall, with respect to the timber 
        sales applicable to such lands that were impacted by such 
        wildfire, convert such timber sales to salvage sales.
            (2) Treatment of converted timber sales.--In the case of a 
        project relating to the timber sales applicable to the National 
        Forest System lands described in paragraph (1), the conversion 
        of such timber sales to salvage sales under such paragraph 
        shall be deemed to meet the purpose and need of such project 
        for purposes of an environmental assessment or an environmental 
        impact statement pursuant to section 102 of the National 
        Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
    (c) Supplemental Information Reports.--The Secretary of Agriculture 
shall give priority to completing supplemental information reports that 
determine, with respect to a pending project planned for National 
Forest System lands prior to a wildfire, whether--
            (1) timber salvage constitutes substantial changes to the 
        proposed action that are relevant to environmental concerns; 
        and
            (2) wildfire constitutes significant new circumstances or 
        information relevant to environmental concerns.

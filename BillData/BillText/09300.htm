  To amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 so that 
  procedures relating to termination of electric service provide that 
  such service may not be terminated during any extreme heat weather 
      event or extreme cold weather event, and for other purposes.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing Unnecessary Deaths During 
Life-Threatening Events Act''.

SEC. 2. EXTREME HEAT AND EXTREME COLD WEATHER EVENTS.

    Section 115(g) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 
1978 (16 U.S.C. 2625(g)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``, subject to paragraph (4)'' after 
        ``nonregulated electric utility which provide that'';
            (2) in paragraph (2)--
                    (A) by inserting ``electric service may not be 
                terminated'' before ``during any period'';
                    (B) by striking ``installments,'' and inserting 
                ``installments.'';
                    (C) by striking ``such service may not be 
                terminated.''; and
                    (D) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as 
                clauses (i) and (ii), respectively;
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as 
        subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively;
            (4) by striking ``The procedures for termination of 
        service'' and inserting the following:
            ``(1) In general.--The procedures for termination of 
        service''; and
            (5) by striking ``Such procedures shall take into account 
        the need to include reasonable provisions for elderly and 
        handicapped consumers.'' and inserting the following:
            ``(2) Elderly and handicapped consumers.--Procedures 
        described in paragraph (1) shall take into account the need to 
        include reasonable provisions for elderly and handicapped 
        consumers.
            ``(3) Extreme weather events.--For purposes of paragraph 
        (1)(B), any period of an extreme heat weather event or extreme 
        cold weather event, as determined by the State regulatory 
        authority (with respect to an electric utility for which it has 
        ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated electric utility, 
        shall be considered to be a period when termination of service 
        to an electric consumer would be especially dangerous to 
        health.
            ``(4) Limitation.--Procedures described in paragraph (1) 
        may authorize temporary suspension of electric service to 
        specific areas as required for the safe operation and 
        maintenance of the infrastructure of the applicable electric 
        utility, including to reduce the risk of fires caused by such 
        infrastructure.
            ``(5) Updated procedures.--Procedures described in 
        paragraph (1) shall be updated, as necessary, by the State 
        regulatory authority (with respect to electric utilities for 
        which it has ratemaking authority) or by the nonregulated 
        electric utility at least once every 10 years, including to 
        reflect the best available science with respect to changing 
        climate conditions.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

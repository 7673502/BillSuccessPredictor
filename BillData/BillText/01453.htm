            ``(1) $250 with respect to each military spouse who is an 
        employee of such employer and who is eligible to participate in 
        an eligible defined contribution plan of such employer at any

            ``(2) so much of the contributions made by such employer to 
        all such plans with respect to such employee during such 
        taxable year as do not exceed $250.
    ``(b) Limitation.--An individual shall only be taken into account 
as a military spouse under subsection (a) for the taxable year which 
includes the date on which such individual began participating in the 
eligible defined contribution plan of the employer and the 2 succeeding 
taxable years.
    ``(c) Eligible Small Employer.--For purposes of this section--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `eligible small employer' means

        408(p)(2)(C)(i)(I)).
            ``(2) Application of 2-year grace period.--A rule similar

        uniformed services if such certification provides the name, 
        rank, and service branch of such spouse.
            ``(2) Exclusion of highly compensated employees.--With 
        respect to any employer, the term `military spouse' shall not

        such plan--

                of employer contributions under such plan which is not 
                less than the amount of such contributions that a 
                similarly situated participant who is not a military 
                spouse would be eligible to receive under such plan 
                after 2 years of service, and

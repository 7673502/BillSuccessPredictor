                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act and Public Health Service 
   Act to improve the reporting of abortion data to the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Accurate and Complete 
Abortion Data Reporting Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Reporting abortion data has been voluntary in the past, 
        which has not resulted in complete data being submitted to the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
            (2) While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        requests specific data points from each State and the District 
        of Columbia, there is a great variety in the information 
        collected and published by the States.
            (3) In fact, there is not a single abortion data point 
        publicly reported for all fifty States and the District of 
        Columbia.
            (4) Even more alarming, three States that together account 
        for 15 percent of the United States population of women of 
        childbearing age do not report any abortion data to the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention.
            (5) Accurate statistical data regarding abortion and those 
        who survive abortion attempts is critical to public health and 
        policy analysis.

SEC. 3. MEDICAID PAYMENTS FOR CERTAIN FAMILY PLANNING SERVICES AND 
              SUPPLIES CONTINGENT ON SUBMISSION OF ABORTION DATA TO 
              CDC.

    Section 1903 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396b) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)(5), by inserting before ``an amount 
        equal to'' the following: ``subject to subsection (bb),''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(bb) Annual Reports on Abortion Data.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), as a condition 
        of receiving payment under subsection (a)(5) with respect to 
        any amount expended during a year (beginning with the year 
        following two years after the date of the enactment of this 
        subsection) for family planning services and supplies described 
        in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described 
        in section 1902(ii) or an individual whose medical assistance 
        under this title is limited to such services and supplies 
        furnished pursuant to a waiver granted under section 1115, each 
        State shall, by not later than December 31 of the previous 
        year, submit to the abortion surveillance system of the Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention, with respect to the year 
        before the previous year, at least abortion data regarding the 
        mandatory questions described in section 317U(a)(3)(A) of the 
        Public Health Service Act.
            ``(2) Late submission of reports.--With respect to a year, 
        in the case of a State that does not submit by December 31 of 
        the previous year the abortion data required under paragraph 
        (1) with respect to the year before the previous year but 
        submits such data by December 31 of the year, such State shall 
        continue to receive payment, including retroactive payment, 
        under subsection (a)(5) with respect to any amount expended 
        during the year for family planning services and supplies 
        described in section 1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual 
        described in such paragraph.
            ``(3) Certification of abortion data.--
                    ``(A) In general.--With respect to each submission 
                of abortion data under this subsection, a State shall 
                certify to the Director of the Centers for Disease 
                Control and Prevention that such data is accurate.
                    ``(B) False information.--In the case that the 
                Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
                Prevention determines that a State has knowingly 
                provided false information with respect to a submission 
                of abortion data under this subsection, such State may 
                not receive payment under subsection (a)(5) with 
                respect to any amount expended during the first full 
                fiscal year following such determination for family 
                planning services and supplies described in section 
                1905(a)(4)(C) furnished to an individual described in 
                paragraph (1).''.

SEC. 4. COLLECTION OF ABORTION DATA BY CDC.

317T of such Act (42 U.S.C. 247b-22) the following:

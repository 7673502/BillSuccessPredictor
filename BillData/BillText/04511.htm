        data submitted by a sponsor in an application for, or 
        submission relating to, the approval, licensure, or clearance

        is deemed to be in the category of examinations and procedures 
        described in section 353(d)(3) of the Public Health Service 
        Act, such determination shall apply with regard to a submission 
        pursuant to section 510(k), 513(f), or 515 for such device,

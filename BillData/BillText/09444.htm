        investigation, pretrial diversion agreement, or the referral of 
        a criminal investigation to another Federal, State, Tribal, or 
        local law enforcement entity.''; and
                    (C) in paragraph (10), by striking ``contact 
                information for the Office of the Victims' Rights

                these rights, including that the victim has the right 
                to seek the advice of an attorney with respect to these 
                rights'';
            (2) in subsection (b)(1), by inserting after the first 
        sentence the following: ``The court shall also confirm with the 
        Government, that the Government has complied with its 
        obligation to accord the rights described in subsection (a).'';
            (3) in subsection (c)--
                    (A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:
            ``(1) Government.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Officers and employees of the 
                Department of Justice and other departments and 
                agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, 
                investigation, or prosecution of crimes shall make 
                their best efforts to see that crime victims are 
                notified of, and accorded, the rights described in 
                subsection (a).

                        to the victim have not been publicly filed, and 
                        the Government determines that according one or 
                        more of the rights described in subsection (a) 
                        would threaten the safety of an individual, 
                        interfere with an ongoing investigation or 
                        prosecution, compromise national security, or 
                        result in premature disclosure of material 
                        nonpublic information, the Government may 
                        request leave from the court to delay according

                        such request if it is supported by clear and 
                        convincing evidence. The Court shall maintain a 
                        record of the Government's request and its 
                        ruling on the matter, which shall be provided

                        not exceed 90 days, except that the Government 
                        may, for good cause, apply for an extension of 
                        the delay period. The granting of a delay under 
                        this subparagraph shall not constitute grounds 
                        for failing to ultimately accord a right to any 
                        victim.

                circumstances, in accordance with subsection (d).

                victim general information on how to seek available pro 
                bono legal representation for the purpose of asserting 
                the rights under this section.''; and

        prosecution of the alleged crime shall advise the crime victim

        attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection 
        (a).'';
            (4) in subsection (d)--

                in which a defendant is being prosecuted or has been 
                prosecuted for the crime. If no prosecution is underway 
                at the time of the motion for relief, the rights 
                described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the 
                district court in the district in which the crime is 
                alleged to have occurred. The motion may be filed in an 
                existing criminal case or, if no complaint, 
                information, or indictment has been filed at that time, 
                by a separate rights enforcement action.

                        information is relevant to the movant's 
                        assertion of the right, the Government shall 
                        promptly provide all such additional 
                        information to the court and movant. The court 
                        may, for good cause, allow the Government to 
                        provide a substantive summary of such 
                        information instead of providing the 
                        information itself. Upon the Government's 
                        request, the court shall enter an appropriate 
                        protective order governing dissemination and 
                        use of any information or substantive summary

                        enter a written opinion, which clearly states 
                        the reasons for the denial.

                petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. 
                The court of appeals may issue the writ on the order of 
                a single judge pursuant to circuit rule or the Federal 
                Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals 
                shall take up and decide such application forthwith 
                within 72 hours after the petition has been filed, 
                unless the litigants, with notice to the court, have 
                agreed to a longer time period for consideration. In

                such determination, shall apply ordinary standards of 
                appellate review to any procedural or substantive 
                issues. If the court of appeals denies the relief 
                sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly 
                stated on the record in a written order or opinion.'';

        victim may make a motion requesting that the Government seek to 
        void a deferred prosecution agreement or non-prosecution 
        agreement by filing a motion with the court in writing 
        asserting that they were not accorded the reasonable right to 
        confer in subsection (a)(5). Upon a finding by the court that 
        the victim's right under subsection (a)(5) was violated, the 
        court may order the Government to confer with the victim. If, 
        after conferring with the victim, the Government determines 
        that it would not have entered into the agreement or would have 
        sought to enter into an agreement with different terms, then 
        the Government may, with the consent of the defendant, withdraw 
        from the agreement, or seek to modify the agreement.
            ``(7) Remedies.--Upon a finding that a victim's rights 
        under this section have been violated, the court shall order a 
        just and appropriate remedy, which may include reopening a 
        proceeding, to address such violation, except that any such 
        remedy may not violate a defendant's constitutional rights and 
        shall account for the interests of other victims and the 
        public. An order under this paragraph, or under paragraph (5) 
        or (6), shall not be construed to impair prosecutorial 
        discretion under paragraph (6).

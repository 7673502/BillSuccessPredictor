  To clarify that section 107 of the Countering America's Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act applies sanctions with respect to unmanned combat 
aerial vehicles following a 2019 change by the United Nations providing 
additional clarity to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Iranian Drones Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) A July 15, 2013, United Nations General Assembly Report 
        on the continuing operation of the United Nations Register of 
        Conventional Arms and its further development (document A/68/
        140) states in paragraph 45, ``The Group noted the discussion 
        of the 2006 Group that category IV already covered armed 
        unmanned aerial vehicles and of the 2009 Group on a proposal to 
        include a new category for such vehicles. The Group reviewed 
        proposals for providing greater clarity to category IV.''.
            (2) Section 107 of the Countering America's Adversaries 
        Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9406), enacted August 2, 2017, 
        requires the President to impose sanctions on any person that 
        the President determines ``knowingly engages in any activity 
        that materially contributes to the supply, sale, or transfer 
        directly or indirectly to or from Iran, or for the use in or 
        benefit of Iran, of any battle tanks, armored combat vehicles, 
        large caliber artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack 
        helicopters, warships, missiles or missile systems, as defined 
        for the purpose of the United Nations Register of Conventional 
        Arms, or related materiel, including spare parts''.
            (3) In 2019, the United Nations formally changed the 
        heading of category IV of the United Nations Register of 
        Conventional Arms to ``combat aircraft and unmanned combat 
        aerial vehicles''.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to prevent Iran and 
Iranian-aligned terrorist and militia groups from acquiring unmanned 
aerial vehicles, including commercially available component parts, that 
can be used in attacks against United States persons and partner 
nations.

                                 A BILL


 
To enable incarcerated persons to petition a Federal court for a second 
   look at sentences longer than 10 years, where the person is not a 
danger to the safety of any person or the community and has shown they 
             are ready for reentry, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Look Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings Related to the United States Criminal Justice 
System.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Although the United States has less than 5 percent of 
        the world's population, the United States holds approximately 
        19 percent of the world's incarcerated population and has the 
        highest rate of incarceration in the world, with more than 
        1,700,000 people incarcerated in State and Federal prisons and 
        local jails.
            (2) The prison population of the United States has 
        increased by more than 270 percent over a 40-year period 
        preceding the date of enactment of this Act.
            (3) The United States incarcerates citizens of the United 
        States at 5 to 10 times the rate of other industrialized 
        nations.
            (4) The face of incarceration in the United States is not 
        exclusively male. Although less than 5 percent of women in the 
        world live in the United States, the United States houses 
        nearly 30 percent of the world's incarcerated women.
            (5) The growth of the incarceration of women in the United 
        States has outpaced that of men by nearly 2-to-1, growing more 
        than 475 percent between 1980 and 2020. Fifty-eight percent of 
        incarcerated women are mothers of minor children and most are 
        the primary caretakers for their children.
            (6) The overall prison population of the United States 
        peaked in 2009 and declined at an annual rate of 1 percent 
        during the subsequent decade. At this pace, it would take until 
        2078, or 56 years, to reduce the prison population by 50 
        percent.
            (7) In 2020, the prison population declined by 15 percent 
        in response to safety precautions related to the COVID-19 
        pandemic, but some prison populations have since bounced back 
        up.
            (8) Nearly 50 percent of the United States Federal prison 
        population in 2022 is incarcerated for a drug trafficking 
        offense.
    (b) Findings Related to the Need for a Second Look.--Congress finds 
the following:
            (1) A second look at the sentences for incarcerated 
        individuals is needed.
            (2) Life sentences of imprisonment and long sentences 
        without the possibility of review violate human rights 
        standards.
            (3) One out of 7 incarcerated individuals is currently 
        serving a life sentence or a virtual life sentence of 50 years 
        or longer. More than 25 percent of those individuals are 
        sentenced to life without parole. One out of every 15 women in 
        prison, or nearly 7,000 women, is serving a life sentence or 
        virtual life sentence.
            (4) In 2020, 147,920 people were serving a life sentence or 
        virtual life sentence in the United States, and 55,945 people 
        were serving a sentence of life without parole, compared to a 
        total of 63 people serving a life sentence without the 
        possibility of release in the United Kingdom.
            (5) Mandatory minimum penalties continue to result in long 
        sentences in the Federal prison system, and--
                    (A) as of 2016--
                            (i) 55.7 percent of the Federal prison 
                        population had been sentenced under a mandatory 
                        minimum provision; and
                            (ii) 25 percent of Federal prisoners 
                        serving life or virtual life sentences have 
                        been convicted of nonviolent crimes, including 
                        30 percent for a drug crime; and
                    (B) in 2021, the average sentence length for 
                individuals who were convicted of an offense carrying a 
                mandatory minimum penalty was 139 months of 
                imprisonment.
            (6) Among those individuals serving life without parole 
        sentences, 40 percent have been convicted of a drug related 
        crime.
            (7) The United States has much more punitive sentencing 
        laws than the rest of the world, as--
                    (A) sentence lengths in most European countries 
                rarely exceed 20 years;
                    (B) Norway abolished life sentences in 1981, and 
                under Norwegian law, the maximum prison term is 21 
                years;
                    (C) in Denmark and Sweden, individuals serving life 
                sentences can be released after 12 years and 18 years 
                of imprisonment, respectively; and
                    (D) in Latin America, only 6 out of 19 countries 
                maintain statutes that allow life imprisonment.
            (8) With the abolition of parole under the Sentencing 
        Reform Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-473; 98 Stat. 1987), there 
        are extremely limited options for review of Federal sentences, 
        which differs greatly from the rest of the world, as--
                    (A) Belgium requires a parole review of life 
                sentences after 10 years;
                    (B) Germany requires a parole review of life 
                sentences after 15 years; and
                    (C) the International Criminal Court requires a 
                parole review of life sentences after 25 years.
            (9) An incarcerated individual should not be precluded from 
        receiving a second look review of their sentence because of the 
        nature of the crime for which the individual was convicted, 
        as--
                    (A) individuals tend to age out of criminal 
                activity starting around 25 years of age;
                    (B) released individuals over the age of 50 have a 
                very low recidivism rate;
                    (C) several studies, State policies and programs, 
                and the National Institute of Corrections of the Bureau 
                of Prisons consider incarcerated individuals aged 50 
                and above to be elderly;
                    (D) incarcerated people age at an accelerated rate 
                because they are more likely than the general public to 
                experience stresses including long histories of alcohol 
                and drug misuse, insufficient diet, lack of medical 
                care, financial struggles, and stress of maintaining 
                safety while behind bars;
                    (E) the Office of the Inspector General of the 
                Department of Justice has found that ``aging inmates 
                commit less misconduct while incarcerated and have a 
                lower rate of re-arrest once released'' and has 
                recommended the early release of aging inmates to help 
                manage the inmate population and reduce costs at the 
                Bureau of Prisons;
                    (F) the cost to State taxpayers to incarcerate the 
                approximately 250,000 individuals aged 50 or older 
                behind bars as of the date of enactment of this Act is 
                approximately $16,000,000,000 each year;
                    (G) incarceration of individuals beyond the age 
                during which the individuals are likely to commit crime 
                is a drain on taxpayer dollars that does nothing to 
                increase public safety;
                    (H) individuals are capable of redemption; and
                    (I) in the words of Bryan Stevenson, ``each of us 
                is more than the worst thing we've ever done''.

                            ``(ii) demonstrates readiness for reentry; 
                        and
                    ``(B) the interests of justice warrant a sentence 
                modification.
    ``(b) Supervised Release.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any defendant whose sentence is reduced

                or
                    ``(B) in the case of a defendant whose original 
                sentence did not include a term of supervised release, 
                a term of supervised release not to exceed the 
                authorized terms of supervised release described in 
                section 3583.
            ``(2) Conditions of supervised release.--The conditions of

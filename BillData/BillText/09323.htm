_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To establish a task force on child and family economic security and 
                     stability for economic growth.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lifting American Children From 
Poverty Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the United States Census Bureau, poverty 
        rates for children under the age of 18 have increased to 16.1 
        percent in 2020, from 14.4 percent in 2019. The increase means 
        that now 11,600,000 children live in poverty, as opposed to 
        10,000,000 in 2019.
            (2) Data from the Children's Defense Fund show that child 
        poverty is an issue that is concentrated in the American south, 
        with statistics showing that Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, 
        Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, 
        Texas, and West Virginia have over a quarter of their child 
        population living in poverty.
            (3) A 2018 Social Work Research report estimated that the 
        annual economic costs of child poverty was $36,000,000,000 to 
        $177,000,000,000, demonstrating how child poverty stalls 
        economic productivity.
            (4) Recent data from the Census Bureau Current Population 
        Survey shows that child poverty increased sharply during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic among Black and Latino families. More 
        specifically, child poverty rose by 4.2 percent in Latino 
        families and 2.8 percent in Black families.
            (5) A report from the Urban Institute demonstrates that 
        poverty is closely associated with a lack of educational 
        achievement. For instance, only 64 percent of persistently poor 
        children graduate from high school.
            (6) The problem of child poverty also acutely affects 
        children of color, with 1 in 5 living in poverty. Another 
        statistic from the Children's Defense Fund (2019) shows that 71 
        percent of children living in poverty were children of color. 
        Children of color are also 2.5 times more likely to live in 
        poverty than their White counterparts.
            (7) The Census Bureau Current Population Survey also shows 
        that COVID-19 erased recent gains in the United States toward 
        combating child poverty. In September 2020, child poverty rates 
        were at its lowest since 1973.
            (8) 3.4 percent of families reported not having enough to 
        eat prepandemic, but during the pandemic that number rose to 12 
        percent according to Center on Budget and Policy Priorities 
        analysis. Among households with children, that number was 16 
        percent.
            (9) Data published by the National Public Radio show that 
        the child tax credit cut monthly child poverty rates by 30 
        percent and kept 3,700,000 children out of poverty. In 
        addition, 91 percent of low-income families spent the tax 
        credit on basic needs, such as food. The monthly payments cut 
        food insufficiency by 25 percent.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to establish an interagency task force 
that would create a strategic and comprehensive plan to reduce child 
poverty, particularly in States with higher poverty rates than the 
national average of 21 percent, by--
            (1) analyzing the state of child and intergenerational 
        poverty and its causes;
            (2) creating an inventory of all available Federal programs 
        aimed at reducing child poverty; and
            (3) making recommendations for improving the effectiveness 
        and efficiency of Federal programs that reduce child poverty.

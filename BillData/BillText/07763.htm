    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall support and

diversify fertilizer sources, and reduce dependency on foreign sources 
for fertilizer, including by--

        and fertilizer alternatives, including nitrogen, phosphate, 
        potassium, biological products and technologies, and other 
        nutrients that may assist in the production of agricultural 
        commodities;
            (2) increasing materials or tools that reduce the need for 
        fertilizer or support the more efficient use of fertilizer, 
        including nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, biological products 
        and technologies, and other nutrients that may assist in the 
        production of agricultural commodities;
            (3) supporting materials and facilities and research and 
        development, that may support the activities carried out 
        pursuant to this section;
            (4) supporting sustainable agriculture production through 
        the use of--
                    (A) sustainable fertilizer produced in, or used in 
                a manner that, reduces the greenhouse gas impact; or
                    (B) fertilizer produced through the use of

                greater precision in fertilizer use;
            (5) supporting activities or other measures that may 
        otherwise address competition-related challenges in the United 
        States fertilizer market and obstacles to producers in 
        obtaining affordable, responsibly manufactured fertilizer as 
        referred to in the notice entitled ``Access to Fertilizer:

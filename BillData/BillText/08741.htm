                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a tax on the total 
   revenue of manufacturers and importers of semi-automatic assault 
                                weapons.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Firearm Industry 
Fairness Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) AR-15s are abnormally dangerous weapons meant for the 
        battlefield. AR-15-style rifles have been the weapon of choice 
        for the killers responsible for the deadliest mass shootings in 
        American history, including the recent mass murders in Buffalo, 
        New York, Uvalde, Texas, and Highland Park, Illinois.
            (2) Major gun manufacturers have been enjoying record-
        breaking sales and profits from AR-15-style rifles, even as gun 
        deaths and mass shootings have risen in the United States. 
        Studies have shown that gun violence and the human and economic 
        toll associated with the more than 40,000 annual firearm deaths 
        in America are strongly correlated with the availability of 
        firearms.
            (3) Large capacity magazines have been shown to lead to 
        increasingly deadly mass shootings because they allow the 
        shooter to continue firing for longer periods of time and 
        reduce the opportunities for law enforcement or other 
        bystanders to intervene to stop the killing.
            (4) Despite widespread diversion of weapons from major 
        manufacturers to unlawful use, the firearm industry has failed 
        to monitor the downstream distribution of their weapons to 
        distributors or other sellers, with the result that an 
        inordinate number of guns used in crimes of violence are 
        funneled through a small number of dealers.
            (5) An investigation into the gun industry's practices and 
        profits by the Committee on Oversight and Reform found that 
        five leading gun manufacturer's collected more than 
        $1,000,000,000 from the sale of AR-15-style weapons in the last 
        decade.

SEC. 2. TAX ON TOTAL REVENUE OF MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS OF SEMI-
              AUTOMATIC ASSAULT WEAPONS.

    (a) In General.--Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is 
amended by inserting after chapter 6 the following new chapter:

  ``CHAPTER 7--MANUFACTURERS AND IMPORTERS OF SEMI-AUTOMATIC ASSAULT 
                                WEAPONS

    ``(b) Total Revenue.--For purposes of this section, the term `total 
revenue' means total gross receipts reduced by the cost of goods sold.
    ``(c) Semi-Automatic Assault Weapons Manufacturer or Importer.--For 
purposes of this section--
            ``(1) In general.--The term `semi-automatic assault weapons

        year, any manufacturer, producer, or importer (within the 
        meaning of section 4181) of any semi-automatic assault weapon 
        or large capacity ammunition feeding device, and any person 
        related to any such manufacturer, producer, or importer, if the 
        aggregate number of semi-automatic assault weapons and large 
        capacity ammunition feeding devices manufactured, produced, or 
        imported by such manufacturer, producer, or importer (and all 
        persons related to such manufacturer, produce, or importer) 
        during such taxable year exceeds 100.
            ``(2) Exception.--For purposes of determining under 
        paragraph (1) the number of such weapons and devices

        not be taken into account any such weapon or device 
        manufactured, produced, or imported solely for use by the 
        United States Government, any State or local government, or any 
        department, agency, or political subdivision thereof. The 
        Secretary shall prescribe such regulations and other guidance 
        as is necessary to prevent avoidance of the purposes of this 
        paragraph.
            ``(3) Related persons.--A person shall be treated as 
        related to another person if such person is in the same 
        controlled group (within the meaning of section 1563(a), 
        applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 
        percent' each place it appears therein) as such other person. 
        Under regulations or other guidance prescribed by the 
        Secretary, principles similar to the principles of the 
        preceding sentence shall apply to a group of persons under 
        common control where 1 or more of such persons is not a 
        corporation.

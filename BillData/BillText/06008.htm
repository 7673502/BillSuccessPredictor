   To provide for a grant program to support access to free eye care 
services for students attending public elementary schools and secondary 
                                schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``See the Board Act''.

SEC. 2. GRANT PROGRAM TO SUPPORT ACCESS TO FREE EYE CARE SERVICES FOR 
              STUDENTS AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
shall, subject to subsection (d), establish a grant program under which 
the Secretary awards grants to eligible entities that provide a 
qualifying eye care services program to purchase portable or mobile 
optometry equipment and to pay for appropriate operational costs, 
including for costs for qualified personal protective equipment, direct 
health care or service delivery costs, and any other relevant expense 
the Secretary determines necessary, for the provision of free eye care 
services through such program to students attending public elementary 
schools or secondary schools (as such terms are defined in section 8101 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
7801)).
    (b) Eligible Entities Described.--For purposes of this section, an 
eligible entity is a nonprofit organization.
    (c) Qualifying Eye Care Services Program.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``qualifying eye care services program'' means a 
program under which such services are furnished free of charge to 
students attending public elementary schools or secondary schools (as 
such terms are defined in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801)) through the use of mobile eye 
clinics or mobile clinics that use portable equipment to bring 
screenings, exams, and an optical shop to such students. Such a program 
may use qualified health care providers at such schools or ophthalmic 
technicians for screening, optometrists or ophthalmologists for follow-
up examinations, and an optician and dispensary for such students to be 
given glasses at such schools.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that eligible 
entities awarded grants under this section should, to the greatest 
extent possible, provide information to students described in 
subsection (a) and parents of such students about the importance of 
adhering to the medically recommended schedule for vision screenings 
and comprehensive eye exams.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary 
for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2027.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

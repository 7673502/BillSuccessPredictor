  To amend the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act to direct the 
  Secretary of the Interior to implement fertility controls to manage 
 populations of wild free-roaming horses and burros, and to encourage 
    training opportunities for military veterans to assist in range

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans for Mustangs Act''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE WILD FREE-ROAMING HORSES AND BURROS ACT.

    Section 3(b)(2) of the Act commonly known as the Wild Free-Roaming 
Horses and Burros Act (16 U.S.C. 1333(b)(2)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``that action is necessary'' and all that 
        follows through ``until all excess animals have been removed'' 
        and inserting ``that action is necessary to reduce the animal 
        population or remove excess animals, the Secretary shall 
        immediately take steps under this paragraph to achieve 
        appropriate management levels. Such action shall be taken, in 
        the following order and priority, until the animal population 
        has been reduced or all excess animals have been removed'';
            (2) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) through (C) as 
        subparagraphs (B) through (D), respectively; and
            (3) by inserting before subparagraph (B), as so 
        redesignated, the following:
                    ``(A) The Secretary shall implement nonsurgical, 
                medically safe on-range fertility controls to manage 
                populations of wild free-roaming horses and burros. In 
                implementing such fertility controls, the Secretary, 
                through the Bureau of Land Management, shall prioritize 
                the recruitment of military veterans to train and 
                become certified in the application of fertility 
                controls with respect to wild free-roaming horses and 
                burros, including the certified PZP applicator 
                certification offered by the Science and Conservation 
                Center's Certification Program. The Secretary shall 
                provide appropriate compensation to military veterans 
                participating in such a certification program. 
                Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
                Secretary is authorized to contract with military 
                veterans who have completed the training program under 
                this subparagraph to carry out management activities 
                under this Act. Individuals contracted with pursuant to 
                this subparagraph shall not be regarded as officers or 
                employees of the United States on the basis of such 
                contract.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

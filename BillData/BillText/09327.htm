                                 A BILL


 
 To establish in the Department of Labor an Older Workers' Bureau, to 
 establish grant programs related to employment of older workers, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Older Workers' Bureau Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Of the 9 million jobs expected to be added by 2030, 
        more than half, 4.7 million, will be filled by workers over 55, 
        according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
            (2) From 1995 to 2020, the share of older workers more than 
        doubled, to nearly 25 percent from 12 percent.
            (3) About 40 percent of middle-class older workers will be 
        downwardly mobile into poverty or near poverty in the next ten 
        years when they reach their sixties in part because of lack of 
        employment or low wages.
            (4) The labor market experience of older workers is shaped 
        by structural ageism, which carries unproven beliefs that older 
        workers are not trainable, move slow, are expensive, and get 
        sick too often.
            (5) Older workers who have less formal education, earn 
        lower wages, or who are Black or Hispanic tend to experience 
        much worse health than those who are more advantaged and need 
        more accommodation at work and safer working conditions.
            (6) Physically and psychologically difficult working 
        conditions are widespread and damaging for older workers.
            (7) Older workers are more likely to be involuntary part 
        time, gig, or temporary workers than for prime age workers.
            (8) Nearly 30 percent of older women work in low wage jobs 
        and most are considered working poor.
            (9) Concern about age discrimination amongst older workers 
        has reached its highest level in nearly decades.
            (10) More than 1,000,000 older workers were pushed out or 
        voluntarily left the labor force during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (11) While some older workers have returned to the labor 
        force since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, many have 
        struggled to obtain work and others fear returning to unsafe 
        working conditions.
            (12) The labor force participation rate and employment 
        population ratio of older workers both declined due to the 
        COVID-19 pandemic and neither have fully recovered.
            (13) Older workers need specific policy consideration and 
        assistance that could be met by establishing an Older Workers' 
        Bureau within the Department of Labor.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to promote productive, 
inclusive, and welfare-enhancing employment opportunities and 
workplaces for older workers through research, policy development, 
outreach, and grant programs.

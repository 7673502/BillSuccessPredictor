SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Commander (CDR) Everett Alvarez, Jr., served with 
        distinction in the Vietnam war and made historic sacrifices for 
        the United States as the first United States pilot to be shot 
        down and captured during the Vietnam war and the second-longest 
        prisoner of war in United States history, surviving over eight-
        and-a-half years in captivity.
            (2) CDR Alvarez was born in Salinas, California, in 1937, 
        and was the grandchild of Mexican immigrants.
            (3) CDR Alvarez attended Salinas Union High School and 
        Hartnell College and received a bachelor of science degree from 
        Santa Clara University.
            (4) In 1960, CDR Alvarez joined the United States Navy and 
        was commissioned as Ensign.
            (5) After receiving his commission, CDR Alvarez attended 
        flight training at the Naval Air Basic Training Command in 
        Pensacola, Florida.
            (6) In June 1961, CDR Alvarez was transferred to the Naval 
        Auxiliary Air Station in Kingsville, Texas, where he trained 
        until December 1961.
            (7) CDR Alvarez was promoted to Lieutenant (junior grade) 
        in April 1962.
            (8) In June 1962, CDR Alvarez joined Attack Squadron 144, 
        nicknamed the ``Roadrunners'', which was deployed to the Gulf 
        of Tonkin prior to the United States entrance in the Vietnam 
        war in August 1964.
            (9) On August 5, 1964, while flying Operation Pierce Arrow 
        from the USS Constellation near the Vietnam-China border, CDR 
        Alvarez's A-4 Skyhawk was shot down and he was captured by a 
        Vietnamese fishing vessel.
            (10) Upon capture, CDR Alvarez was taken to the Hoa Lo 
        Prison in Hanoi, known to many former prisoners as the ``Hanoi 
        Hilton''.
            (11) CDR Alvarez spent his first thirteen months, eight 
        days, and five hours in isolation.
            (12) While at Hoa Lo, CDR Alvarez was repeatedly beaten and 
        tortured and was fed inedible meals and suffered 
        malnourishment.

            (14) Despite torture and interrogation, CDR Alvarez 
        remained loyal to the United States and assisted other American 
        prisoners of war.
            (15) CDR Alvarez, with his own actions, encouraged and 
        inspired fellow prisoners of war to ``Return with Honor'', 
        which meant keeping their integrity in the face of torture and 
        not cooperating with or divulging information to the enemy, so 
        they could return home having remained loyal to the United 
        States.
            (16) While at ``the Zoo'', an overflow prison camp on the 
        outskirts of Hanoi, CDR Alvarez taught the mute hand code 
        communication technique to other captives and used the code to 
        keep up spirits and stay organized.
            (17) On July 6, 1966, CDR Alvarez and 51 other American 
        prisoners of war were forced to march in the ``Hanoi Parade''

        Postgraduate School's Alumni Hall of Fame on March 27, 2015.
            (22) CDR Alvarez served in Program Management at the Naval 
        Air Systems command in Washington, DC, from October 1976 until 
        his retirement.
            (23) CDR Alvarez retired from the Navy on June 30, 1980, 
        completing a 20-year Naval career.
            (24) In 1983, CDR Alvarez earned his juris doctor from the

SEC. 2. SECURE SOUTHERN BORDER.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, 
shall--
            (1) transfer all structures, equipment, personnel, and 
        other barriers used to provide additional security in the 
        District of Columbia from January 12 through the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, including what was used for the 
        Inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as President and 
        Vice President of the United States, to the southern border of 
        the United States;
            (2) determine as soon as reasonably feasible where to erect 
        and place the structures, equipment, personnel, and other 
        barriers in order to impede to the greatest extent possible 
        illegal border crossings into the United States; and
            (3) ensure such structures, equipment, personnel, and other 
        barriers remain intact along the southern border until--
                    (A) a determination is made by the Secretary of 
                Homeland Security, in consultation with the 
                Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 
                that the southern border is secure and illegal border 
                crossings are no longer feasible; and
                    (B) such a determination made pursuant to 
                subparagraph (A) is affirmed by a two-thirds majority 
                vote in the House of Representatives and the Senate.

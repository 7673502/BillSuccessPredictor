                                 A BILL


 
To establish the policy of the United States with respect to supporting 
  an insurgency in Ukraine in the event of an invasion of Ukraine by 
                    Russia, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Supplying Ukraine with Provisions to 
Protect against Ongoing Russian Threats Act'' or the ``SUPPORT Act''.

SEC. 2. UKRAINE ANTI-RUSSIAN INSURGENCY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interests of the United 
        States to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
        Ukraine, and to continue and deepen the security partnership 
        between the United States and Ukraine;
            (2) aggression and malign influence by Russia and its 
        proxies in Ukraine are a threat to the sovereignty and 
        democratic government of Ukraine;
            (3) coordination by the United States with the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organization for Security and 
        Cooperation in Europe, and members of the international 
        community can help strengthen the opposition to the efforts of 
        Russia to further encroach on the territorial sovereignty and 
        right to self-determination of Ukraine;
            (4) Congress supports efforts to resolve the crisis 
        diplomatically, without compromising on the principles on which 
        the NATO alliance and European security rest; and
            (5) Congress believes that the principle that nations may 
        not change borders by force is central to the post-World War II 
        international order.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States 
that, in the event of an invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the United 
States will take necessary and appropriate steps to support Ukrainian 
efforts to reassert control of its territory, expel an invading foreign 
force, and defend its sovereignty. These steps include supporting a 
Ukrainian insurgency with lethal and nonlethal assistance, and 
intelligence sharing, with the aim of imposing grave costs on Russia 
for actions threatening international peace and security.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Requirement.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary of Defense 
        for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict, in 
        coordination with any other official the Assistant Secretary 
        determines appropriate, shall submit to the appropriate 
        congressional committees a report containing a plan for 
        providing support described in subsection (b) to a Ukrainian 
        insurgency, including with respect to funding, weapons, partner 
        contributions, intelligence sharing, and type of systems to be 
        deployed, and means of insertion.
            (2) Form.--The report under paragraph (1) may be submitted 
        in classified form, but if so submitted shall include an 
        unclassified executive summary.
    (d) Intelligence Community Assessment Regarding Russian Gray Zone 
Assets.--
            (1) Intelligence community assessment.--The Director of 
        National Intelligence, acting through the National Intelligence 
        Council, shall produce an intelligence community assessment 
        that contains--
                    (A) a description of the gray zone assets of 
                Russia;
                    (B) an identification of any opportunities to hold 
                such gray zone assets at risk, as a method of 
                influencing the behavior of Russia; and
                    (C) an assessment of the risks and potential 
                benefits, with respect to the interests of the United 
                States, that may result from the seizure of such gray 
                zone assets to hold the assets at risk.
            (2) Considerations.--In identifying opportunities to hold a 
        gray zone asset of Russia at risk under paragraph (1)(B), the 
        National Intelligence Council shall consider the following:
                    (A) The effect on civilians of holding the gray 
                zone asset at risk.
                    (B) The extent to which the gray zone asset is 
                substantially State-owned or substantially controlled 
                by Russia.
                    (C) The likelihood that holding the gray zone asset 
                at risk will influence the behavior of Russia.
                    (D) The likelihood that holding the gray asset at 
                risk, or degrading the asset, will affect any attempt 
                of Russia to use force to change existing borders or 
                undermine the political independence or territorial 
                integrity of any State, including Ukraine.
                    (E) Such other factors as the National Intelligence 
                Council may determine appropriate.
            (3) Appendix.--The intelligence community assessment under 
        paragraph (1) shall include an appendix that contains a list of 
        the categories of gray zone assets of Russia, with specific 
        examples of--
                    (A) gray zone assets in each category; and
                    (B) for each such gray zone asset listed, the ways 
                in which Russia uses the asset to advance its gray zone 
                activities.
            (4) Submission.--The Director, consistent with the 
        protection of sources and methods, shall submit to the 
        Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
        Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
        Senate the intelligence community assessment under paragraph 
        (1).
            (5) Form.--The intelligence community assessment under 
        paragraph (1) shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may 
        contain a classified annex.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--

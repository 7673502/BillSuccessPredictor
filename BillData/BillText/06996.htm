                approve an application for approval of a product for a 
                serious or life-threatening disease or condition, 
                including a fast track product, under section 505(c) of 
                this Act or section 351(a) of the Public Health Service 
                Act upon a determination--
                            ``(i) that the product has an effect on a 
                        surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to 
                        predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical 
                        endpoint that can be measured earlier than 
                        irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is 
                        reasonably likely to predict an effect on 
                        irreversible morbidity or mortality or other 
                        clinical benefit, taking into account the 
                        severity, rarity, or prevalence of the disease

                        profile of such product in the intended 
                        population, taking into account the severity, 
                        rarity, or prevalence of the disease or 
                        condition and the availability or lack of

                (A) may meet with appropriate officials of the Food and 
                Drug Administration to develop a plan to provide 
                clarity and certainty for the sponsor regarding the 
                applicability of the requirements of this subsection. 
                Such a plan shall include--
                            ``(i) a determination as to whether the

                        treat an unmet medical need;
                            ``(ii) an agreement on the surrogate or 
                        intermediate clinical endpoint to be assessed, 
                        if applicable;

                effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other 
                clinical benefit.
                    ``(B) That the sponsor submit copies of all

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON EMPLOYMENT OF INSTRUCTORS FUNDED BY THE CHINESE 
              COMMUNIST PARTY.

    Title I of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001 et

provision of law, no institution of higher education shall be eligible 
to receive funds or any other form of financial assistance under any 
Federal program for an award year in which the institution employs an 
CCP-funded instructor.
    ``(b) Resumption of Eligibility.--An institution of higher 
education that loses eligibility to receive funds for an award year as

funds in a subsequent award year by demonstrating, to the satisfaction 
of the Secretary, that the institution no longer employs a CCP-funded 
instructor.
    ``(c) CCP-Funded Instructor Defined.--In this section, the term 
`CCP-funded instructor' means a professor, teacher, or any other 
individual who--
            ``(1) provides instruction directly to the students of an 
        institution of higher education; and
            ``(2) received funds, directly or indirectly, from the 
        Chinese Communist Party while employed by such institution.''.

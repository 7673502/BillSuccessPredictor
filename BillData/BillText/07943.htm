 To permit Members of the House of Representatives to use the Members' 
Representational Allowance to continue to provide services for casework 
 projects on behalf of former constituents who no longer reside in the 
    Member's congressional district as the result of congressional 
                             redistricting.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. USE OF MEMBERS' REPRESENTATIONAL ALLOWANCE TO CONTINUE 
              PROVIDING SERVICES FOR CASEWORK PROJECTS FOR FORMER 
              CONSTITUENTS AFFECTED BY REDISTRICTING.

    (a) Use of Allowance.--Section 101 of the House of Representatives 
Administrative Reform Technical Corrections Act (2 U.S.C. 5341) is 
amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (e) as 
        subsections (d) through (f); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(c) Use for Continuing Casework Services for Certain Former 
Constituents.--If a Member of the House of Representatives provides 
services for a casework project on behalf of an individual who is a 
constituent of the Member during a Congress but who is not a 
constituent during a succeeding Congress, the provision of casework 
services for that project on behalf of that individual by the Member 
during the first session of the succeeding Congress shall be considered 
as part of the Member's official and representational duties during the 
first session of the succeeding Congress for purposes of this section 
if the individual would have been a constituent during the succeeding 
Congress but for the enactment of a congressional redistricting 
plan.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to services provided during the One Hundred 
Seventeenth Congress and any succeeding Congress.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

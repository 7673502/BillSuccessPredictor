Cities Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Sanctuary jurisdiction.--
                    (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph 
                (B), the term ``sanctuary jurisdiction'' means any 
                State or political subdivision of a State that has in 
                effect a statute, ordinance, policy, or practice that 
                prohibits or restricts any government entity or 
                official from--
                            (i) sending, receiving, maintaining, or 
                        exchanging with any Federal, State, or local 
                        government entity information regarding the 
                        citizenship or immigration status of any alien; 
                        or
                            (ii) complying with a request lawfully made 
                        by the Department of Homeland Security under 
                        section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and 
                        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) to 
                        comply with a detainer for, or notify about the 
                        release of, an alien.
                    (B) Exception.--A State or political subdivision of 
                a State shall not be deemed a sanctuary jurisdiction 
                based solely on having a policy whereby its officials 
                will not share information regarding, or comply with a 
                request made by the Department of Homeland Security 
                under section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and 
                Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1226 and 1357) to comply with 
                a detainer regarding, an alien who comes forward as a 
                victim or a witness to a criminal offense.
            (2) Sanctuary policy.--The term ``sanctuary policy'' means 
        a statute, ordinance, policy, or practice referred to in 
        paragraph (1)(A).
            (3) Sanctuary-related civil action.--The term ``sanctuary-
        related civil action'' means a civil action brought against a 
        sanctuary jurisdiction by an individual (or the estate, 
        survivors, or heirs of an individual) who--
                    (A) is injured or harmed by an alien who benefitted 
                from a sanctuary policy of the sanctuary jurisdiction; 
                and
                    (B) would not have been so injured or harmed but 
                for the alien receiving the benefit of such sanctuary 
                policy.

        alien (as defined in section 101(a)(3) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(3))) has been arrested,

        year, may bring an action for compensatory damages against a 
        State or a political subdivision of a State in the appropriate 
        Federal or State court if the State or political subdivision 
        failed to comply with--
                    (A) a request with respect to an alien that was 
                lawfully made by the Department of Homeland Security 
                under section 236 or 287 of the Immigration and

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To make financial assistance under the Rural Energy for America program 
  available with respect to certain electric vehicle supply equipment 
                               expenses.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Vehicle Charging 
Infrastructure for Farmers Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The transition to electric vehicles is a critical step 
        towards reducing global emissions. According to the United 
        States Department of Energy, ``electric vehicles produce fewer 
        emissions that contribute to climate change and smog than 
        internal combustion vehicles''.
            (2) Nearly half of all people in the United States live in 
        counties with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution. 
        Every year, more than 20,000 people in the United States die 
        prematurely from pollution stemming from the transportation 
        sector.
            (3) Demand for publicly accessible electric vehicle 
        chargers continues to grow. The National Renewable Energy 
        Laboratory estimates that by 2050, between 106,000 and 138,000 
        stations with 343,000 and 447,000 ports could be needed to meet 
        consumer demand.
            (4) Travel by people who live in rural areas constitutes 68 
        percent of our Nation's lane miles, but such people represent 
        only 19 percent of our Nation's population. The cost per mile 
        traveled is lower for electric vehicles, saving rural drivers 
        thousands of dollars over the lifetimes of their vehicles.

SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPMENT EXPENSES FOR 
              FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE RURAL ENERGY FOR AMERICA 
              PROGRAM.

    Section 9007 of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 
(7 U.S.C. 8107) is amended by adding at the end the following:

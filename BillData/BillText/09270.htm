new subsection:
    ``(g) Prohibiting Certain Fundraising Until Balanced Budget 
Resolution Is in Effect and Appropriations Bills Are Enacted.--
            ``(1) Prohibition.--During a fiscal year, a Member of 
        Congress (including a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to the 
        Congress), a national congressional campaign committee of a 
        political party, or an affiliated committee of a national 
        congressional campaign committee of a political party may not 
        solicit funds in connection with an election for Federal office 
        until each of the following applies:
                    ``(A) There is in effect for such fiscal year a 
                concurrent resolution on the budget under which, 
                notwithstanding the exclusion of off-budget items, the 
                excess of total budget authority (including all on- and 
                off-budget authority and net interest costs) over total 
                receipts declines gradually from the fiscal year and 
                each of the 9 succeeding fiscal years such that the 
                total receipts exceed total budget authority not later 
                than the ninth succeeding fiscal year, and in no case 
                later than the last day of fiscal year 2033 (as 
                certified by the Director of the Congressional Budget 
                Office).
                    ``(B) Each of the regular appropriations bills for 
                such fiscal year has been enacted into law.
                    ``(C) Each of the regular appropriations bills for 
                such fiscal year, as enacted, is consistent with the 
                concurrent resolution on the budget for such fiscal 
                year.
            ``(2) Regular appropriation bill defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term `regular appropriation bill' means any 
        annual appropriation bill which, with respect to the Congress 
        involved, is under the jurisdiction of a single subcommittee of 
        the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives 
        (pursuant to the Rules of the House of Representatives for that 
        Congress) and a single subcommittee of the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate (pursuant to the Standing Rules of 
        the Senate).''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to fiscal year 2024 and each succeeding fiscal year.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

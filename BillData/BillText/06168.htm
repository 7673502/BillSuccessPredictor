                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the emission of any greenhouse 
  gas in any quantity from any new electric utility steam generating 
                     unit, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Future Generations Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The use of fossil fuels exacerbates the climate crisis, 
        threatens America's natural resources, and disproportionately 
        damages frontline environmental justice communities.
            (2) In order to avoid the worst consequences of climate 
        change, the Federal Government should transition away from 
        fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
            (3) In achieving its energy goals, it is the responsibility 
        of the Federal Government to ensure a fair and just transition 
        for workers and frontline communities.
            (4) The Federal Government should do this by prioritizing 
        racial and gender equity, environmental justice, and partnering 
        with labor unions to ensure that workers have training for and 
        access to clean-energy jobs.

SEC. 3. EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES.

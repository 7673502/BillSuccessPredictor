                                 AN ACT


 
 To require the development of a strategy to promote the use of secure 
  telecommunications infrastructure worldwide, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Global Telecommunications 
Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress as follows:
            (1) The United States Government should promote and take 
        steps to ensure American leadership in strategic technology 
        industries, including telecommunications infrastructure and 
        other information and communications technologies.
            (2) The expansive presence of companies linked to the 
        Chinese Communist Party, such as Huawei, in global mobile 
        networks and the national security implications thereof, such 
        as the ability of the People's Republic of China to exfiltrate 
        the information flowing through those networks and shut off 
        countries' internet access, demonstrates the importance of the 
        United States remaining at the technological frontier and the 
        dire consequences of falling behind.
            (3) The significant cost of countering Huawei's market 
        leadership in telecommunications infrastructure around the 
        world underscores the urgency of supporting the competitiveness 
        of United States companies in next-generation information and 
        communication technology.
            (4) To remain a leader at the International 
        Telecommunication Union (ITU) and preserve the ITU's technical 
        integrity, the United States must work with emerging economies 
        and developing nations to bolster global telecommunications 
        security and protect American national security interests.
            (5) Multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners and 
        allies is critical to carry out the significant effort of 
        financing and promoting secure networks around the world and to 
        achieve market leadership of trusted vendors in this sector.

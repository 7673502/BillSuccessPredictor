                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the use of Federal funds to require any officer or employee 
      of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to receive a COVID-19 
                  vaccination, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDING.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Border Agents Stay 
Employed Act'' or the ``BASE Act''.
    (b) Finding.--Congress finds that allowing for alternatives to the 
COVID-19 vaccination, such as regular testing and the wearing of masks, 
would allow U.S. Customs and Border Protection to retain more of its 
critical workforce.

SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON MANDATING CBP EMPLOYEES TO RECEIVE COVID-19 
              VACCINE.

    Notwithstanding any other law, rule, or regulation, including 
Executive Order 14043 (86 Fed. Reg. 50989; relating to requiring 
coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination for Federal employees), during 
fiscal year 2022 and each fiscal year thereafter, no Federal funds may 
be obligated or expended to require any officer or employee of U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

SEC. 301. CREW TRANSPORTATION SAFETY.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) ensuring the safety of American astronauts is the top 
        priority of NASA's human spaceflight program;
            (2) in efforts to meet deadlines to return humans to the 
        Moon, NASA should take all steps necessary to mitigate any and 
        all risk to crew; and
            (3) it is the role of Congress to exercise prudence in the 
        use of taxpayer dollars and ensure transparency to the taxpayer 
        to the greatest extent possible.
    (b) In General.--To ensure that NASA's human exploration systems 
comply with the direction in this Act to have a shared safety standard 
that is consistent across all elements of the architecture, the 
Administrator shall--
            (1) implement a program to ensure that best practices, 
        lessons learned and other information is shared across all 
        elements of the human exploration program, including public-
        private partnerships and commercial service procurement;
            (2) require that any entity receiving funding for the 
        development or operation of a human spaceflight element or 
        activity make all necessary information available to NASA and 
        the appropriate government oversight entities, including the 
        NASA Advisory Committee and its subcommittees, the Aerospace 
        Safety Advisory Committee and the relevant committees of 
        Congress; and
            (3) produce a public report twice a year detailing progress 
        towards meeting or sustaining the shared safety standards and 
        identifying areas, programs, or services where these standards 
        have not been met or maintained, and the associated corrective 
        action to address these issues.
    (c) Report.--Within 120 days of enactment, the Administrator shall 
provide a report to the Committees on the implementation of this 
direction and how it plans to ensure these comparable safety standards 
are met throughout the development, test and operation of such systems.
    (d) Congressional Notice.--
            (1) Should any element of human exploration system 
        architecture, whether owned and operated by NASA, developed and 
        operated as a public-private partnership or procured as a 
        commercial service, fails to meet the common safety standards 
        established, Congress shall be notified and receive a report on 
        corrective actions and options available to improve safety and 
        resiliency of such system(s) within 30 days.

SEC. 404. COUNTERING CHINESE THREATS TO U.S. ACTIVITIES IN SPACE.

    (a) Findings.--
            (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China 
        maintains, as a national priority, a global program of theft 
        and other misappropriation of intellectual property, and 
        unacceptable technology transfer requirements, particularly in 
        fields of high technology.
            (2) China is taking steps to establish a commanding 
        position in the commercial launch and satellite sectors relying 
        in part on aggressive state-backed financing that market-driven 
        companies cannot match.
            (3) China has engaged in an aggressive campaign to dominate 
        sensitive markets such as germanium wafer production, used for 
        nearly all specialized satellite solar panels, allowing China 
        ownership of over 70 percent of global germanium mining, 
        refining, and production.
            (4) China has begun focusing on the lunar surface and 
        cislunar space as priorities in its space program, which is 
        indistinguishable from its armed forces.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment, 
the Executive Secretary of the National Space Council shall submit to 
the appropriate committees of Congress a report that includes:
            (1) How China is harming the U.S. commercial space 
        industry's competitiveness and threatening U.S. national 
        security. Specifically, the Executive Secretary shall 
        investigate--
                    (A) theft of intellectual property through 
                technology transfer requirements or otherwise;
                    (B) Chinese efforts to seize control over critical 
                elements of the space industry supply chain;
                    (C) Chinese efforts to seize control over space 
                industry companies, sister companies with shared 
                leadership, or supply chain; and
                    (D) U.S. cybersecurity weaknesses.
            (2) Current steps the United States is taking to protect 
        its domestic space industry from Chinese influence.
            (3) Recommendations to Congress on legislative action 
        necessary to address Chinese threats to the U.S. domestic 
        commercial launch and satellite industries and improve U.S. 
        efforts to counter threats to U.S. activities in space.
            (4) Recommendations on how the U.S. Government can best 
        utilize existing Federal entities to investigate and act 
        against potentially harmful Chinese investment into the U.S. 
        commercial space industry, and how the U.S. Government can 
        bolster domestic investment in critical U.S. space industry 
        technologies.

SEC. 405. CONSIDERATION OF ISSUES RELATED TO CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES

commercial entity related through ownership, control, or other 
affiliation to such entity) as a result of a significant loan or other 
financial assistance provided by--
            (1) any governmental organization of the People's Republic 
        of China; or

                    (A) majority owned or controlled by, or otherwise 
                affiliated with, any governmental organization of the 
                People's Republic of China; or
                    (B) organized under, or otherwise subject to, the 
                laws of the People's Republic of China.

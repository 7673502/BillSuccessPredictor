                                 A BILL


 
  To protect and expand access to donor milk, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Donor Milk Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) The term ``donor milk'' means human milk that is 
        processed without additives by a nonprofit milk bank.
            (2) The term ``nonprofit milk bank'' means a milk bank 
        that--
                    (A) is accredited by an accrediting body that is 
                recognized by, or meets standards established by, the 
                Food and Drug Administration for purposes of 
                accrediting milk banks;
                    (B) collects, tests, processes, pasteurizes, and 
                distributes donor milk; and
                    (C) is described in section 501(c)(3) of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) and 
                exempt from tax under section 501(a) of such Code (26 
                U.S.C. 501(a)).

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Human milk is the optimal first food for infants.
            (2) Medically vulnerable infants, including those born 
        prematurely and those with congenital or acquired conditions, 
        derive significant health benefits from human milk.
            (3) Mothers of medically vulnerable infants often face 
        unique obstacles to producing enough milk. When a parent's milk 
        is not available, the provision of donor milk improves health 
        outcomes.
            (4) Nonprofit milk banks provide an essential medical 
        service.
            (5) The nonprofit milk banking model of donor non-
        remuneration and standardized processing of single ingredient 
        pools ensures a safe and high-quality product for the Nation's 
        most vulnerable infants.

SEC. 4. SUPPORT FOR DONOR MILK ACTIVITIES.

    Section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (b)(4), by inserting ``(including support 
        for donor milk activities)'' after ``promotion''; and
            (2) in subsection (h)(1)(C), by adding at the end the 
        following:
                            ``(iii) Donor milk.--A State agency may use 
                        amounts made available under clause (i) for the 
                        collection and storage of unprocessed donations 
                        of human milk, the transfer of such milk to a 
                        nonprofit milk bank, and to make donor milk

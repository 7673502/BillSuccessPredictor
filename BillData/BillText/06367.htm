    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) support the territorial integrity and sovereignty of 
        Ukraine;
            (2) declassify or downgrade United States intelligence, 
        consistent with the need to protect sources and methods, on 
        Russian malign activities in Ukraine, Belarus, and the Baltic 
        and Black Sea nations, to the maximum extent possible, to 
        enable and encourage dissemination to United States allies and 
        partners and to the American public;
            (3) provide critical capabilities, including surface-to-air 
        missiles, air defense systems, anti-ship missiles, anti-tank 
        mines, and others, to Ukraine on an expedited basis;
            (4) reaffirm ``the freedom of States to choose their own 
        security arrangements,'' as pledged in the 1990 Charter of 
        Paris for a New Europe, to which Russia was a signatory;
            (5) demand the Government of Russia reaffirms its 
        commitment to agreements to which it is a signatory, including 
        the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the 1990 Charter of Paris, and the 
        1994 Budapest Memorandum;
            (6) remain fully committed to NATO's Open Door Policy, 
        which provides a path to membership for any European country 
        that shares our values and meets the necessary responsibilities 
        and obligations;
            (7) continue to fully support NATO's decision in the 2008 
        Bucharest Summit Declaration, reaffirmed ever since, including 
        in the June 2021 Brussels Summit, that Ukraine and Georgia will 
        become NATO members;
            (8) commit to include all relevant European countries in 
        discussions about European security and to prioritize existing 
        mechanisms, such as the Organization for Security and 
        Cooperation in Europe and the NATO-Russia Council, for those 
        discussions;
            (9) reject the proposals publicized on December 17, 2021, 
        by the Government of Russia as a legitimate basis of 
        negotiations on European security issues;
            (10) repudiate Russia's proposal for a ``deployment 
        moratorium'' in the European theater for intermediate-range 
        ground launched missile systems that were previously banned 
        under the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty until 
        Russia repeatedly violated the agreement causing its demise;
            (11) encourage near-term, in-person visits by United States 
        and Ukraine leaders to each other's countries;
            (12) support the rapid deployment of additional observers 
        from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to 
        monitor the Ukraine-Russian border and report aggressive acts; 
        and
            (13) continue the current United States nuclear declaratory 
        policy of ``calculated ambiguity'' and reject changes to United 
        States nuclear declaratory policy of ``calculated ambiguity'' 
        and reject changes to United States nuclear declaratory policy 
        that would invite further Russian aggression and undermine NATO 
        unity, and tempt nuclear proliferation, such as ``Sole 
        Purpose,'' ``Fundamental Purpose,'' or ``No First Use''.

        deter Russian aggression in the form of military incursions, 
        cyber attacks, the coercive use of energy resources, the 
        disruption of lawful commerce and traffic to Ukrainian ports, 
        use of passportization, efforts to corrupt the Ukrainian 
        political and economic systems, and attempts to manipulate the 
        public through disinformation campaigns.
            (2) A description of the United States current efforts and 
        strategy to support Ukrainian diplomatic initiatives when they

                    (A) to set Russia's adherence to an immediate and 
                comprehensive cease-fire and the withdrawal of Russian 
                forces, military equipment and mercenaries from the 
                territory of Ukraine as prerequisites to further 
                negotiations on other provisions of the Minsk 
                Agreements; and
                    (B) to ensure Kyiv is not obliged to alter the 
                status of the areas in the Donbas illegally occupied by 
                Russian-backed separatists in a manner that would 
                permanently undermine the Government of Ukraine's full 
                sovereignty over the region or foreclose its freedom to 
                choose its own security arrangements and foreign policy 
                trajectory.
            (6) An assessment of Ukraine's recent progress on anti-

        bilateral relationship and has played into Russia's calculus 
        regarding its military buildup in and around Ukraine; and
            (2) President Biden should move to expeditiously submit to 
        the Senate for its advice-and-consent a nominee for the 
        Ambassador to Ukraine that has experience addressing the 
        Russian problem set and serving in war zones or conflict areas.

                    ``(B) a description of any condition or 
                prerequisite placed by Russia on military cooperation

assets and companies in Ukraine's aerospace and defense sector are not 
subject to foreign ownership, control, or undue influence by strategic

                sector and the national security implications for 
                Ukraine, the United States, and other NATO allies and 
                partners.
                    (B) An assessment of the vulnerabilities that 
                strategic competitors of the United States exploit to 
                acquire strategic assets in the Ukrainian aerospace and 
                defense sector, Ukraine's progress in addressing them, 
                and United States initiatives to support these efforts 
                such as assistance in strengthening Ukraine's 
                investment screening and national security vetting 
                laws.

                            (ii) better leverage tools like debt 
                        financing, equity investments, and political 
                        risk insurance to incentivize greater 
                        participation by United States firms;

SEC. 215. STRATEGY FOR COOPERATION ON INTERMEDIATE-RANGE MISSILE 
              LAUNCHERS AND SYSTEMS TO NATO ALLIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) All NATO allies agree that the SSC-8/9M729 missile 
        system developed and deployed by the Government of Russia 
        violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (in this 
        section referred to as the ``INF Treaty''), while posing a 
        significant risk to NATO security.
            (2) Despite NATO allies' repeated calls on the Government 
        of Russia to return to full and verifiable compliance with the 
        INF Treaty, Russia continued to develop and deploy INF Treaty-
        violating systems, which led to the INF Treaty's demise on 
        August 2, 2019.
            (3) As of the INF Treaty's demise, Russia had produced and 
        deployed multiple battalions of INF Treaty-violating missiles, 
        capable of reaching key European capitals and targets.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--A mutual deployment moratorium in the 
European theater with the Russian Federation is not in the interest of 
the United States. Even if a European-Theater intermediate-range 
ground-launched missile deployment moratorium were verifiable, any such 
moratorium would significantly advantage Russia and disadvantage NATO. 
This is due to the Russian Federation's continual threats of aggression 
against sovereign European nations, the relative ease by which Russia 
could deploy such systems to the theater, and the logistical 
impediments with which the United States and NATO would have to contend 
should it be determined a commensurate response was warranted.
    (c) Strategy.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
State shall jointly develop a strategy to cooperate with willing NATO 
member countries in the joint research, development, training and 
possible transfer of conventional intermediate-range ground-launched 
missiles, associated launchers and support equipment, and associated 
technology.

                                 A BILL


 
    To authorize the location of a memorial on the National Mall to 
 commemorate and honor the members of the Armed Forces that served on 
 active duty in support of the Global War on Terrorism, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Global War on Terrorism Memorial 
Location Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nearing two decades after the September 11 attacks 
        against the United States, America continues the Global War on 
        Terrorism, at great personal cost to men and women serving on 
        active duty in the Nation's Armed Forces and to those whose 
        support they depend upon to fulfill their duties.
            (2) Civil servants from Federal agencies, the intelligence 
        community, local emergency responders, and other civilian 
        support personnel have made significant sacrifices in their 
        service in the Global War on Terrorism.
            (3) Honoring the losses endured by these individuals and 
        their families, in 2017 Congress unanimously passed and the 
        President signed Public Law 115-51, which allowed the Global 
        War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation to establish a memorial to 
        the fallen on Federal land in the District of Columbia.
            (4) Given the significance of the Global War on Terrorism 
        as the longest-running conflict in United States history and 
        the magnitude of the sacrifice involved in these operations, it 
        is appropriate to locate the memorial to the Global War on 
        Terrorism within the Reserve alongside existing memorials to 
        the Nation's major armed conflicts.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM MEMORIAL LOCATION.

    (a) Authorization.--Notwithstanding section 8908(c) of title 40,

(commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works Act''), shall apply to the 
Memorial.
    (d) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, the following 
definitions apply--
            (1) Memorial.--The term ``Memorial'' means the National 
        Global War on Terrorism Memorial authorized by subsection (a).
            (2) Reserve.--The term ``Reserve'' has the meaning given 
        that term in 8902(a)(3) of title 40, United States Code.

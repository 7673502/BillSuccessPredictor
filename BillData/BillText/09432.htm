                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Airborne Wind Energy Research and Development Program, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Airborne Wind Energy Research and 
Development Act''.

SEC. 2. AIRBORNE WIND ENERGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall establish a 
research, development, demonstration, and commercial application 
program to be known as the ``Airborne Wind Energy Research and 
Development Program'' (in this section referred to as the ``Program'') 
to improve understanding of the following:
            (1) The quantity, quality, and complementary nature of wind 
        resources at elevations above 200 meters.
            (2) Various airborne wind energy concepts through modeling 
        and simulation, including power density, robust controls, and 
        scaling potential.
            (3) Potential benefits of airborne wind energy, such as 
        portability, low material inputs, viewshed, and existing grid 
        interconnections.
            (4) Environmental impacts of airborne wind energy 
        technology.
            (5) Noise and visual impacts, as well as any other human 
        impacts of airborne wind energy technology.
    (b) Activities.--In carrying out the Program, the Secretary of 
Energy shall carry out research, development, demonstration, and 
commercial application activities to improve the following:
            (1) Wind resource data capabilities in the 200m-800m 
        elevation range onshore and offshore, including mesoscale 
        modeling techniques.
            (2) Airborne wind energy designs and technologies, 
        including the following:
                    (A) Generators and generator placement.
                    (B) Design load and structural integrity across 
                varying concepts, including soft and rigid wings.
                    (C) Tether technologies.
                    (D) Flight operation, such as flying crosswind or 
                remaining stationary.
                    (E) Takeoff and landing, including autonomous 
                landings.
            (3) Understanding of social and environmental impacts of 
        airborne wind energy on wildlife, nearby communities, radar, 
        and airspace, as well as any other concerns.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--The following are authorized 
to be appropriated to carry out the Program:
            (1) $5,000,000 for fiscal year 2023.
            (2) $5,250,000 for fiscal year 2024.
            (3) $5,512,500 for fiscal year 2025.
            (4) $5,788,125 for fiscal year 2026.
            (5) $6,077,531 for fiscal year 2027.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

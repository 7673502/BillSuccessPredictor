          regarding land in Illinois, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS.

    (a) Jurisdiction Conferred on the United States Court of Federal 
Claims.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, jurisdiction is 
hereby conferred upon the United States Court of Federal Claims, which 
may hear, determine, and render judgment on the Miami Tribe of 
Oklahoma's land claim under the Treaty of August 1, 1805 (7 Stat. 91), 
without regard to the statute of limitations identified in section 2501 
of title 28, United States Code, and any delay-based defense, including 
laches, estoppel, or acquiescence, no matter how characterized. The 
United States shall be the only entity or individual liable regarding 
such a claim. The jurisdiction hereby conferred on the United States 
Court of Federal Claims shall expire unless a claim is filed by the 
Miami Tribe of Oklahoma within 1 year after the date of the enactment 
of this Act.
    (b) Extinguishment of Title and Claims.--Except for the claim of 
the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma against the United States as a defendant in 
an action before the United States Court of Federal Claims as provided 
in subsection (a), all other claims of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma, or 
any member, descendant, or predecessor in interest to the Miami Tribe 
to title are extinguished, including claims arising under the Treaty of 
Grouseland, the Northwest Ordinance, the 5th amendment to the 
Constitution, the laws commonly known as the ``Trade and Intercourse 
Act of 1790'', and any other Federal law, treaty, or agreement.

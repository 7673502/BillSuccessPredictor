                                 A BILL


 
To establish a national network of electric vehicle charging stations, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Vehicle Freedom Act'' or 
the ``EV Freedom Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Electric vehicles will play an important role in 
        transitioning to a cleaner transportation system that protects 
        Americans' health and our planet. According to the United 
        States Department of Energy, electric vehicles ``produce fewer 
        emissions that contribute to climate change and smog than 
        conventional vehicles.''.
            (2) Electric vehicles are becoming more popular among 
        American consumers. United States sales of electric vehicles 
        increased 27 percent between 2016 and 2017, and 81 percent 
        between 2017 and 2018, achieving a record sales volume of 
        361,307 units.
            (3) Access to electric vehicle charging stations is 
        currently insufficient to meet consumer demand. According to 
        the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ``two key areas of 
        needed improvement in actual vehicle charging are speed 
        (reducing battery charging times) and coverage (having adequate 
        and accessible charging stations)''.
            (4) Demand for publicly accessible electric vehicle 
        chargers is projected to grow. There are an estimated 41,878 
        publicly available electric vehicle direct current fast 
        charging stations (DC Fast and Level 2) with 101,296 charging 
        outlets available in the United States. A report released in 
        April 2021 by Lawrence Berkeley Labs at the University of 
        California-Berkley, estimated that the number of EV chargers 
        required to support the accelerated transition necessary to 
        meet GHG was 8.1 million public EV charge points by 2050.
            (5) In August 2020, cumulative U.S. plug-in electric 
        vehicle sales reached 1.6 million units. In February 2021, 
        53,247 electric vehicles were sold in the United States, a 
        64.8-percent increase from the electric vehicle sales in 
        February 2020.
            (6) However, China and the European Union are exceeding the 
        United States in the EV manufacturing sector. China is the 
        world leader in total EV production and total EV sales; 45 
        percent of global electric vehicles were built and sold in 
        China. China also already produces the global majority of 
        passenger EVs (60 percent) and is expected to produce 65 
        percent of global lithium-ion batteries by 2021. Currently, 
        China has 7 of the 10 largest lithium-ion mega-factories by 
        production capacity, while the United States only has one. 
        Europe accounted for 24 percent of the global EV fleet in 2018. 
        In order for the United States to remain a competitor in auto 
        manufacturing, the U.S. must greatly increase investment in the 
        infrastructure necessary for wide adoption of EVs.
            (7) Americans demand the freedom to roam with their 
        electric vehicle and convenient charging opportunities. 
        However, failure to expand access to publicly accessible 
        electric vehicle chargers will prevent the wider adoption of 
        electric vehicles and, therefore, hinder progress towards a 
        more sustainable transportation system. According to a study 
        produced by the Michigan Energy Office and Michigan State 
        University, ``limited charging infrastructure for electric 
        vehicles has been one of the main barriers in adopting these 
        vehicles''.
            (8) Expediting the wider adoption of electric vehicles will 
        require considerable changes to consumer behavior, which will 
        not be possible without the creation of necessary 
        infrastructure. According to a study produced by the 
        Transportation Research Board and National Research Council, 
        ``adoption and diffusion of new innovations can be a long-term, 
        complicated process that is especially slow for products that 
        cost tens of thousands of dollars and where consumers have 
        questions about infrastructure availability, resale value, and 
        other variables'', and ``a perception of a lack of public 
        charging infrastructure might hinder [plug-in electric vehicle] 
        deployment.''. Thus, greatly expanding access to publicly 
        accessible electric vehicle chargers will be essential to 
        changing consumer behavior radically and, accordingly, 
        accelerating the wider adoption of electric vehicles.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish a network of 
electric vehicle charging stations along eligible roads so that the 
United States may lead the world in protecting the environment while 
improving consumer experiences. The implementation of this Act will 
encourage the widespread adoption of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty 
electric vehicles by--
            (1) establishing a convenient system of charging networks;
            (2) allowing drivers to charge vehicles more quickly; and
            (3) ensuring that vehicle charging is equitably accessible

        encourages a consistent, reliable, secure, convenient and equal 
        access consumer charging and payment experience to all members 
        of the public.
            (12) Publicly available EVSE placement and construction in 
        or near frontline and vulnerable communities, provided such 
        placements benefit such communities and does not harm or 
        displace community members.
            (13) Adequate signage for users to identify publicly 
        available EVSE that ensures uniformity in providing road users 
        direction to publicly available EVSE locations.
            (14) Existing EVSE investments, proposal or projects that 
        are complementary towards the deployment of publicly available 
        EVSE under this Act are not precluded by plan development.

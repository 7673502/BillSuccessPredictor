SEC. 5. ASSESSMENT PROGRAM FOR OFFSHORE AQUACULTURE.

    (a) Establishment.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall establish an assessment 
program to evaluate the following with respect to offshore aquaculture:
            (1) The ability of different commercial-scale facility 
        designs and operational methods to--
                    (A) survive various atmospheric and ocean 
                conditions, including high wind speeds or high-energy 
                ocean conditions associated with severe weather, 
                without--
                            (i) allowing escapes of cultivated 
                        organisms;
                            (ii) loss of infrastructure; or

                        loss or damaged infrastructure;
                    (B) prevent adverse wildlife impacts, including 
                entanglements of large whales, sea turtles, and other 
                species protected under the Endangered Species Act of 
                1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and the Marine Mammal

                to existing ocean users due to aquaculture facilities, 
                including requirements for operations, navigation, and 
                transit associated with such facilities.
            (2) The ability for different technologies to provide 
        reliable and timely data on offshore aquaculture facilities 
        (including visual data and other relevant data types) to enable 
        the Administrator to monitor--
                    (A) project compliance with the requirements of

                    (C) interference with existing uses of the water 
                body in which the project is located.
            (3) The relative risks, benefits, and cost of various types 
        of aquaculture, including different species of finfish in 
        different geographies and under varying climactic and 
        ecological conditions.
            (4) The development of performance standards for offshore 
        aquaculture operations.

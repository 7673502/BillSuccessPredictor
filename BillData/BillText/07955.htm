SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Leading Against White Supremacy Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. WHITE SUPREMACY INSPIRED HATE CRIME.

    (a) In General.--A person shall be determined to have engaged in a 
white supremacy inspired hate crime when white supremacy ideology is 
found to have motivated the planning, development, preparation, or 
perpetration of actions that constituted a crime or were undertaken in 
furtherance of activity that, if effectuated, would have constituted a 
crime.
    (b) Conspiracy.--A conspiracy to engage in white supremacy inspired 
hate crime shall be determined to exist--
            (1) between two or more persons engaged in the planning, 
        development, preparation, or perpetration of a white supremacy 
        inspired hate crime; or
            (2) between two or more persons--
                    (A) at least one of whom engaged in the planning, 
                development, preparation, or perpetration of a white 
                supremacy inspired hate crime; and
                    (B) at least one of whom published material 
                advancing white supremacy, white supremacist ideology, 
                antagonism toward ``replacement theory'', or hate 
                speech that vilifies or is otherwise directed against 
                any non-white person or group, and such published 
                material--
                            (i) was published on a social media 
                        platform or by other means of publication with 
                        the likelihood that it would be viewed by 
                        persons who are predisposed to engaging in any 
                        action in furtherance of a white supremacy 
                        inspired hate crime, or who are susceptible to 
                        being encouraged to engage in actions in 
                        furtherance of a white supremacy inspired hate 
                        crime;
                            (ii) could, as determined by a reasonable 
                        person, motivate actions by a person 
                        predisposed to engaging in a white supremacy 
                        inspired hate crime or by a person who is 
                        susceptible to being encouraged to engage in 
                        actions relating to a white supremacy inspired 
                        hate crime; and
                            (iii) was read, heard, or viewed by a 
                        person who engaged in the planning, 
                        development, preparation, or perpetration of a 
                        white supremacy inspired hate crime.
    (c) Department of Justice Authority, Enforcement, Monitoring, and 
Reporting.--The Department shall have authority to conduct operations 
and activities pursuant to this section, specifically--
            (1) with regard to information or evidence obtained by the 
        Department of any action cited in this section, the Department 
        shall have the authority to investigate, intercede, and 
        undertake other actions that it deems necessary and appropriate 
        to interdict, mitigate, or prevent such action from culminating 
        in violent activity;
            (2) the Department shall have the authority to prosecute 
        persons who engaged in actions cited in this section; and
            (3) the Uniform Crime Reporting Program in the Department

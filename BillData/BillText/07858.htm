SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States and around the world, digital 
        platforms and online services play a central role in modern 
        life by providing new tools for communication, commerce, 
        entrepreneurship, and debate.
            (2) The United States takes pride in the success of its 
        technology sector, which leads the world in innovation and 
        dynamism, provides valuable services to the people of the 
        United States, and supports thousands of good-paying jobs in 
        the United States.
            (3) In recent years, a few digital platforms have 
        benefitted from the combination of economies of scale, network 
        effects, and unique characteristics of the digital marketplace 
        to achieve vast power over the economy, society, and democracy 
        of the United States.
            (4) The last time Congress enacted legislation to 
        meaningfully regulate the technology or telecommunications 
        sector was the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-
        104; 110 Stat 56.), years before many of today's largest 
        digital platforms even existed.
            (5) Digital platforms remain largely unregulated and are 
        left to write their own rules without meaningful democratic 
        input or accountability.
            (6) The unregulated policies and operations of some of the 
        most powerful digital platforms have at times produced 
        demonstrable harm, including--
                    (A) undercutting small businesses;
                    (B) abetting the collapse of trusted local 
                journalism;
                    (C) enabling addiction and other harms to the 
                mental health of the people of the United States, 
                especially minors;
                    (D) disseminating disinformation and hate speech;
                    (E) undermining privacy and monetizing the personal 
                data of individuals in the United States without their 
                informed consent; and
                    (F) in some cases, radicalizing individuals to 
                violence.
            (7) The failure of the United States Government to 
        establish appropriate regulations for digital platforms cedes 
        to foreign competitors the historic role played by the United 
        States in setting reasonable rules of the road and technical 
        standards for emerging technologies.
            (8) Throughout the history of the United States, Congress 
        has often responded to the emergence of powerful and complex 
        new sectors of the economy by empowering sector-specific expert 
        Federal regulators.
            (9) Throughout the history of the United States, the 
        Federal Government has established reasonable regulation, 
        consistent with the First Amendment to the Constitution of the 
        United States, to promote a diversity of viewpoints, support 
        civic engagement, and preserve the right of citizens to 
        communicate with each other, which is foundational to self-
        governance.
            (10) The unique power and complexity of several digital 
        platforms, combined with the absence of modern Federal 
        regulations, reinforces the need for a new Federal body 
        equipped with the authorities, tools, and expertise to regulate 
        digital platforms to ensure their operations remain consistent, 
        where appropriate, with the public interest.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Federal agency established under this Act should--
            (1) develop appropriate regulations and policies grounded 
        in the common law principles of the duty of care and the duty 
        to deal, insofar as those principles are relevant and 
        practical; and
            (2) adopt, where relevant and practical, a risk management 
        regulatory approach that prioritizes anticipating, limiting, 
        and balancing against other interests the broad economic, 
        societal, and political risks of harm posed by the activities 
        and operations of a person or class of persons.

                        persons employed by the Commission, or

                        interests of a person that are involved in a 
                        particular case are minimal.

                managerial efforts directed to the related activities 
                of the company or other entity, as compared to the 
                other aspects of the business of the company or other 
                entity;

                the company or other entity may be affected by any 
                action of the Commission; and

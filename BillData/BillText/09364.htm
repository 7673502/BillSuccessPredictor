_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To promote the African Continental Free Trade Area, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening the African 
Continental Free Trade Area Act of 2022'' or the ``Strengthening the 
AfCFTA Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) By 2035, the gross domestic product of African 
        countries is projected to increase by $450,000,000,000 with the 
        implementation of the AfCFTA and lift 30,000,000 Africans out 
        of extreme poverty while boosting the wages of African women 
        and unskilled workers in particular, according to World Bank 
        estimates.
            (2) According to the World Bank, the total intracontinental 
        exports from African countries would increase by 81 percent 
        under the AfCFTA. By economic sector, the AfCFTA is expected to 
        be especially important for expanding manufacturing, by 
        increasing intracontinental manufacturing exports by 110 
        percent, which will diversify African economies and decrease 
        the reliance of such economies upon extracting natural 
        resources.
            (3) The AfCFTA will also increase African manufacturing 
        exports to the rest of the world by 46 percent. As a result of 
        the AfCFTA creating new commercial opportunities and 
        diversifying global supply chains, the rest of the world's 
        gross domestic product is expected to increase by 
        $76,000,000,000.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) support the African Union's Agenda 2063 efforts to 
        promote regional economic development, diversification, and 
        integration by stimulating greater trade and investment among 
        African countries and between Africa and the global trade 
        partners of Africa, notably including greater collaboration 
        with the United States;
            (2) partner with the African Union Commission, African 
        Union entities such as the African Continental Free Trade Area 
        Secretariat, regional economic communities, and other 
        intergovernmental African organizations to bolster trade and 
        investment at the regional, intracontinental, and international 
        levels;
            (3) increase opportunities for trade and investment between 
        African countries and United States businesses, including those 
        owned by members of the African diaspora, thereby contributing 
        to potential United States economic growth; and
            (4) promote the goals of the African Continental Free Trade 
        Area (AfCFTA), formed by the Agreement Establishing the African 
        Continental Free Trade Area, done at Kigali, Rwanda on March 
        21, 2018, to simplify and expedite trade and investment among 
        African countries and expand commercial opportunities for 
        underserved groups, women, and youth entrepreneurs.

                                 A BILL


 
To improve the public health response to addressing maternal mortality 
       and morbidity during the COVID-19 public health emergency.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Maternal Health Pandemic Response 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a 
        ``Public Health Emergency of International Concern'' on January 
        30, 2020. As of December 12, 2022, there have been over 
        643,875,000 confirmed cases of, and over 6,630,000 deaths 
        associated with, COVID-19 worldwide.
            (2) In the United States, the number of cases of COVID-19 
        has quickly surpassed the number of such cases in every other 
        nation, and as of December 12, 2022, over 99,000,000 cases and 
        1,080,000 deaths have been reported by the United States alone.
            (3) Longstanding systemic health and social inequities have 
        put communities of color at increased risk of contracting 
        COVID-19 or experiencing severe illness; age-adjusted 
        hospitalization rates from COVID-19 are highest for American 
        Indian and Alaska Native, Black, and Latinx people.
            (4) Prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United 
        States was facing a maternal mortality and morbidity crisis, in 
        which the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate 
        in the developed world, and the crisis is worsening.
            (5) More than 50,000 women in the United States annually 
        experience severe maternal morbidity, and much larger numbers 
        experience more common harmful challenges, such as prenatal and 
        postpartum mood disorders, including depression, anxiety 
        disorder, and PTSD; limited access to prenatal and postpartum 
        care, diagnosis, and treatment of complications; intimate 
        partner violence; and lack of support for meeting breastfeeding 
        goals. Many perinatal complications are preventable or 
        treatable, and most injuries, long-term adverse effects, and 
        deaths are preventable.
            (6) Compared to White women, Black and American Indian and 
        Alaska Native women in the United States are 2 to 4 times more 
        likely to die from pregnancy-related complications, and Black 
        and American Indian and Alaska Native women suffer 
        disproportionately high rates of maternal morbidity. The 
        maternal mortality rate for Hispanic women, which historically 
        has been lower than such rate for White women, is increasing 
        and is now nearly the same as that of White women.
            (7) The causes of maternal mortality and morbidity are 
        complex and include racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and 
        geographic inequities; racism, bias, and discrimination; 
        comorbidities; and inadequate access to the health care system, 
        including behavioral health care, which are factors that have 
        similarly contributed to the racial disparities seen in COVID-
        19 outcomes.
            (8) The burden of morbidity and mortality in the United 
        States for both COVID-19 and maternal health outcomes has also 
        fallen disproportionately on Black, Latinx, and American Indian 
        and Alaska Native communities, who suffer the most from great 
        public health needs and are the most medically underserved. 
        Underserved women also include those living in maternity care 
        deserts, which lack obstetric providers and hospitals or birth 
        centers offering obstetric care.
            (9) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, ``pregnant and recently pregnant people with COVID-
        19 are at increased risk for severe illness when compared with 
        non-pregnant people''. Additionally, ``pregnant people with 
        COVID-19 are also at increased risk for preterm birth and some 
        data suggest an increased risk for other adverse pregnancy 
        complications and outcomes, such as preeclampsia, coagulopathy, 
        and stillbirth, compared with pregnant people without COVID-
        19''. Research has also shown that COVID-19 infection during 
        pregnancy may increase the risk of preeclampsia; having 
        preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications also increases 
        the risks of serious COVID-19 infection.
            (10) As of December 2022, the latest information from the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that 
        pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and are at 
        higher risk for intensive care unit admissions than nonpregnant 
        women due to COVID-19, and Latinx and Black pregnant people 
        have been disproportionately infected by COVID-19, as well as 
        more likely to experience severe disease.
            (11) Our understanding of the specific impact of COVID-19 
        on pregnant people has grown significantly. Pregnant and newly 
        delivered women are more susceptible to serious infection from 
        COVID-19, a direct impact. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic 
        has further strained the health care system and decreased 
        access to preconception, prenatal, and postpartum care. The 
        lack of access to care, including mental health care, increases 
        the risks of maternal mortality and morbidity, pregnancy loss, 
        and infant mortality. It has also added another layer of fear 
        and vulnerability for pregnant people, with disproportionate 
        effects on people of color.
            (12) As of March 7, 2022, over 180,000 pregnant people in 
        the United States have tested positive for COVID-19 and 293 
        pregnant people have died as a result of COVID-19.
            (13) The World Health Organization states that everyone 
        ``has the right to safe and positive childbirth experience, 
        whether or not they have a confirmed COVID-19 infection, this 
        includes the right to respect and dignity, a companion of 
        choice, clear communication by maternity staff, pain relief 
        strategies, and mobility in labor when possible and the 
        position of choice''.
            (14) A COVID-19 public health response without concerted 
        Federal action and focus on maternal health care access and 
        quality, research, data collection, mitigation of negative 
        socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic, and protection of 
        the right to safe and positive childbirth experience has 
        exacerbated the maternal mortality and morbidity crisis. Risk 
        has also increased for pregnant women who have not been 
        provided with a continuum of respectful, responsive, and 
        empowering care from preconception through postpartum, during 
        the pandemic and beyond.

orientation, immigration status, insurance status, and State and Tribal 
location, including the following:
            (1) Data related to all COVID-19 diagnostic testing, 
        including the number of pregnant people and postpartum people 
        tested and the number of positive cases.

    (b) Emergency Temporary Standard.--
            (1) In general.--In consideration of the grave risk

        shall develop, publicly post, and update Federal 
        recommendations in multiple languages to ensure quality, 
        provide nondiscriminatory maternity care, promote positive 
        birthing experiences, and improve maternal health outcomes 
        during the COVID-19 public health emergency and future public 
        health emergencies, with a particular focus on outcomes for 
        communities of color and rural populations. Such guidelines and 
        recommendations shall--
                    (A) address, with particular attention to ensuring 
                equitable treatment on the basis of race and 
                ethnicity--

                        elevated risk factors;
                            (iv) diagnostic testing for pregnant and

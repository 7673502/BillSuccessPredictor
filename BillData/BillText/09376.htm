SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Unmanned aircraft systems have the potential to change 
        and transform sectors of the United States economy.
            (2) Current uses and applications of unmanned aircraft 
        systems include agriculture, law enforcement, public safety, 
        disaster evaluation and response, fire detection, border 
        security, weather forecasting, construction, utility 
        monitoring, and many other uses and applications.
            (3) Research, development, demonstration, testing, and 
        evaluation of counter-UAS systems activities are critical to 
        fully understand the capabilities of and threats posed by 
        unmanned aircraft systems.
            (4) Unmanned aircraft systems are subject to safety, 
        privacy, cybersecurity, and supply chain risks, particularly as 
        most unmanned aircraft systems in the United States are 
        manufactured or assembled from parts manufactured in foreign 
        countries.
            (5) National and homeland security threats posed by 
        unmanned aircraft systems include criminal and terrorist use 
        for espionage, surveillance, and intelligence gathering, 
        smuggling drugs and contraband, and platforms to deliver 
        explosives or chemicals, biological, radiological or nuclear 
        weapons, and other firearms.
            (6) The Federal Government has an important role in 
        advancing research, development, voluntary consensus standards, 
        and education activities in unmanned aircraft systems and 
        counter-UAS systems technologies through coordination and 
        collaboration between State, local, Federal, and Tribal 
        governments, academia, and the private sector.
            (7) There is a lack of voluntary consensus standards for 
        unmanned aircraft systems for academia and the public and 
        private sectors.
            (8) The United States needs to invest in domestic 
        manufacturing and secure supply chains of unmanned aircraft 
        systems to meet the demand by the Government and the commercial 
        sectors, to reduce reliance on foreign-made systems.
            (9) Advanced air mobility aims to transform the way people 
        and goods are transported through new capabilities and 
        applications.

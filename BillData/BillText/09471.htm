                  Capability, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Critical Materials Processing 
Technology Testbed Act''.

SEC. 2. CRITICAL MATERIALS PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TESTBED.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with other 
        appropriate Federal agencies, shall administer a competitive, 
        merit reviewed process to establish a Critical Materials 
        Processing Technology Testbed Capability (referred to in this 
        section as the ``Testbed'') that allows for--
                    (A) research, development, and demonstration of 
                novel critical materials processing technologies; and
                    (B) scalable performance testing to be conducted on 
                feedstock materials.
            (2) Selection.--In administering the process referred to in 
        paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider applications from 
        National Laboratories, institutions of higher education, 
        private companies, multi-institutional collaborations, and 
        other entities the Secretary determines appropriate. The 
        Secretary may implement the Testbed as a single site or more 
        than one site as necessary to carry out the mission of the 
        Testbed as described in subsections (a) and (b).
    (b) Focus Areas.--The Testbed shall include a focus on substantive 
and innovative improvements to critical materials processing 
technologies, including relating to the following:
            (1) Reduced energy intensity.
            (2) Reduced pollutants.
            (3) Reduced water consumption.
            (4) Lower environmental and societal impacts.
            (5) Lower lifecycle costs.
            (6) Improved recovery efficiencies.
            (7) Process improvement beyond traditional thermal or pyro 
        chemical techniques.
            (8) Reduced volumes and toxicity of waste.
            (9) Noise reduction.
            (10) Worker safety.
            (11) Processing techniques and technologies which have 
        applicability to a wide range of material sources.
    (c) Duration.--
            (1) In general.--The Testbed shall receive support for a 
        period of not more than five years, subject to the availability 
        of appropriations.
            (2) Renewal.--Upon the expiration of any period of support 
        of the Testbed, the Secretary may renew support for the 
        Testbed, on a merit-reviewed process, for a period of not more 
        than five years.
    (d) Technology Transfer.--The Secretary, in coordination with the 
Director of the Office of Technology Transitions of the Department, 
shall facilitate the translation and secure transfer to industry of 
research results produced at the Testbed.
    (e) Intellectual Property.--The Secretary shall ensure the 
intellectual property and value proposition generated by research, 
development, and demonstration activities at the Testbed are retained 
within the United States.
    (f) Interagency Engagement.--In carrying out this section, the 
Secretary shall--
            (1) consult with the Administrator of the Environmental 
        Protection Agency to ensure the goals and objectives of the 
        Testbed align with applicable laws and regulations and 
        environmental justice priorities; and
            (2) ensure appropriate cooperation with, and avoid 
        unnecessary duplication of, the activities of the Testbed with 
        the activities of--
                    (A) other research entities of the Department;
                    (B) the National Laboratories;
                    (C) other Federal agencies;
                    (D) institutions of higher education;
                    (E) United States industry;

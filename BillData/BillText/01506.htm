concerned a report annually. Such report shall--
            (1) make the disclosures described in the Sustainable 
        Accounting Standard for the Extractives and Minerals Processing 
        Sector and the Renewable Resources and Alternative Energy 
        Sector in effect on the date the report is filed (that is 
        produced by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board); and
            (2) disaggregate the information in paragraph (1) by State

and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary concerned shall submit a 
report to Congress that includes--
            (1) with respect to covered operations, the annual and 2-
        year totals of greenhouse gas emissions, air quality, water 
        management, biodiversity impacts, production, and number of 
        sites according to the metrics described in the Sustainable 
        Accounting Standard for Oil and Gas Exploration and Production

            (4) for renewable energy operations, an estimate of the 
        greenhouse gas emissions that would result from production of 
        the same amount of energy using fossil fuels and water 
        management, including water use, biodiversity impacts, 
        production, number of sites, and acres including associated 
        transmission lines;
            (5) the emission produced during the construction of solar 
        panels and wind turbines that would be used for renewable

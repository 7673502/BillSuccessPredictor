                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to prohibit mandatory pre-
        dispute arbitration agreements, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Investor Choice Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Investor confidence in fair and equitable recourse is 
        essential to the health and stability of the securities markets 
        and to the participation of retail investors in those markets.
            (2) Issuers, brokers, dealers, and investment advisers hold 
        powerful advantages over investors, and mandatory arbitration 
        clauses, including contracts that force investors to submit 
        claims to arbitration or to waive the right of investors to 
        participate in a class action lawsuit, leverage those 
        advantages to severely restrict the ability of defrauded 
        investors to seek redress.
            (3) Investors should be free to--
                    (A) choose arbitration to resolve disputes if they 
                judge that arbitration truly offers them the best 
                opportunity to efficiently and fairly settle disputes; 
                and
                    (B) pursue remedies in court should they view that 
                option as superior to arbitration.

SEC. 3. ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

    (a) In General.--The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a

        shareholder relating to the parties as issuer and shareholder, 
        mandates arbitration for any dispute between the issuer and the 
        shareholders of the issuer, without regard to whether such a 
        provision in the bylaws, documents, or contract is otherwise 
        permissible under title 9, United States Code.''; and

 To prevent doses of vaccines for COVID-19 from being wasted, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Vaccinate More Americans Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. PHASED ALLOCATION INAPPLICABLE WHERE IT IS REASONABLY NECESSARY 
              TO PREVENT THE EXPIRATION OF ANY DOSE OF VACCINE FOR 
              COVID-19.

    (a) In General.--Where it is reasonably necessary to prevent the 
expiration of any dose of vaccine for COVID-19 purchased from the 
Federal Government, a vaccine provider may--
            (1) disregard any phased allocation of such dose under 
        applicable Federal, State, and local law; and
            (2) administer such dose to an individual who is in the 
        next phased allocation group under applicable Federal, State, 
        and local law for which the vaccine provider can locate 
        individuals available and willing to receive the dose.
    (b) Preemption.--Subsection (a) preempts any State or local law to 
the contrary.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be 
construed to override Federal, State, or local law other than with 
respect to the phased allocation of dosing.
    (d) Definition.--In this section, the term ``phased allocation'' 
means the prioritization of groups for the receipt of the vaccine for 
COVID-19 as determined by appropriate public health authorities.
    (e) Sunset.--Subsection (a) shall cease to apply at the end of the 
public health emergency declared for COVID-19 under section 319 of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), including renewals thereof.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

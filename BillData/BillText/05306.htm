 To direct the Secretary of the Navy to notify Congress of the pending 
     retirement of any naval vessel that is a viable candidate for 
              artificial reefing, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Re-using Equipment for Environmental 
Fortification Act'' or the ``REEF Act''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION OF PENDING RETIREMENTS OF NAVAL 
              VESSELS THAT ARE VIABLE CANDIDATES FOR ARTIFICIAL 
              REEFING.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Navy should explore and solicit artificial reefing 
opportunities with appropriate entities for any naval vessel planned 
for retirement before initiating any plans to dispose of the vessel.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days before the retirement from the 
Naval Vessel Register of any naval vessel that is a viable candidate 
for artificial reefing, the Secretary of the Navy shall notify Congress 
of the pending retirement of such vessel.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

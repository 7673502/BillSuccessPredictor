SEC. 2. COMBATING ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE.

    Section 319E of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-5) is 
amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence, by 
                striking ``and coordinate Federal programs relating to 
                antimicrobial resistance'' and inserting ``relating to 
                antimicrobial resistance, coordinate Federal programs 
                relating to antimicrobial resistance, and pursue the 
                goals of the National Strategy for Combating 
                Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (referred to in this 
                section as the `National Strategy')'';
                    (B) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:
            ``(2) Members of task force.--The task force described in 
        paragraph (1) shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of Health 
        and Human Services, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the 
        Secretary of Defense, and shall be composed of representatives 
        of relevant Federal agencies and such executive departments, 
        agencies, or offices as the co-chairs may designate.'';
                    (C) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:
            ``(4) Meetings.--At least twice a year, the task force 
        described in paragraph (1) shall have a public meeting to 
        assess progress and obstacles to implementing the objectives of 
        the National Strategy. The task force may discuss and review 
        based on need or concern the following (among other issues):
                    ``(A) Federal activities to slow the emergence of 
                antimicrobial-resistant pathogens and prevent the 
                spread of resistant infections. Such activities may 
                include optimal use of vaccines and other infection 
                control measures to prevent infections, implementation 
                of health care policies and antimicrobial stewardship 
                programs that improve patient outcomes, regional 
                efforts to control transmission across community and 
                health care settings, and public awareness campaigns.
                    ``(B) Federal activities to strengthen national 
                One-Health surveillance efforts, which are efforts 
                addressing the interactions between human, animal, and 
                environmental health, to combat antimicrobial 
                resistance. One-Health surveillance efforts to combat 
                antimicrobial resistance may include enhanced data 
                sharing and coordination of surveillance and laboratory 
                systems across human and animal settings, and enhanced 
                monitoring of sales, usage, resistance, and management 
                practices of antimicrobial drugs along the food-
                production chain. Such surveillance and laboratory 
                systems may include the National Healthcare Safety 
                Network, the Emerging Infections Program, the National 
                Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System, the 
                National Animal Health Monitoring System, the National 
                Animal Health Laboratory Network, the Veterinary 
                Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, and the

                and use of rapid and innovative diagnostic tests for 
                identification and characterization of antimicrobial-
                resistant pathogens. Such efforts may include 
                development of new diagnostic tests and expansion of 
                their availability and use to improve treatment, 
                infection control, and outbreak response.
                    ``(D) Federal efforts to accelerate basic and 
                applied research and development for new antimicrobial 
                drugs, other therapeutics, prevention efforts, and 
                vaccines. Such efforts may include support for basic 
                and applied research, provision of scientific services 
                and guidance to researchers, and fostering of public-
                private partnerships.

within the National Healthcare Safety Network among all health care 
facilities across the continuum of care, including, as appropriate, 
acute care hospitals, dialysis facilities, nursing homes, ambulatory 
surgical centers, and other ambulatory health care settings in which 
antimicrobial medications are routinely prescribed. The Secretary shall 
seek to collect such data from electronic medication administration 
reports and laboratory systems to produce the reports described in

        adversely affecting public health;
            ``(5) assist in studying the epidemiology of infections 
        from such pathogens;
            ``(6) evaluate commonly used antimicrobial susceptibility 
        testing methods to improve the accuracy of resistance testing

        of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens to enhance infection 
        control and facilitate outbreak detection and response in 
        health care and community settings.
    ``(b) Geographic Distribution.--The sites established under 
subsection (a) shall be geographically distributed across the United 
States.
    ``(c) Nonduplication of Current National Capacity.--The sites 
established under subsection (a) may be based in academic centers, 
health departments, and existing surveillance and laboratory sites.

``SEC. 319E-3. CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall maintain a Clinical Trials 
Network on Antimicrobial Resistance to enhance, strengthen, and expand 
research on clinical science, antimicrobial and diagnostic development, 
and optimal usage strategies with respect to addressing antimicrobial 
resistance. Such Network shall, at a minimum--

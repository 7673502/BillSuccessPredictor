         which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
           To prevent, treat, and cure tuberculosis globally.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``End Tuberculosis Now Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Tuberculosis (referred to in the Act as ``TB'') is a 
        preventable, treatable, and curable disease, yet more than 25 
        years after the World Health Organization declared it to be a 
        public health emergency and called on countries to make scaling 
        up TB control a priority, TB remains a deadly health threat.
            (2) In 2019 alone, an estimated 10,000,000 people became 
        ill with TB, 10 percent of whom were children, and 1,400,000 of 
        whom died. In order to achieve by 2035 the goals of the 
        Political Declaration of the High-Level Meeting of the General 
        Assembly on the Fight Against Tuberculosis, adopted by the 
        United Nations General Assembly October 10, 2018, and of the 
        World Health Organization End TB Strategy, adopted by the World 
        Health Assembly in 2014, new and existing tools must be 
        developed and scaled-up.
            (3) Over \1/3\ of people who become ill with TB may be 
        undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, resulting in unnecessary illness, 
        communicable infections, and increased mortality.
            (4) Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely 
        disrupted TB responses in low- and middle-income countries, 
        stalling and reversing years of progress made against TB. 
        According to the World Health Organization, global detection 
        dropped by 18 percent between 2019 and 2020 and an estimated 
        1,300,000 fewer people were diagnosed and enrolled on TB 
        treatment, and in some countries case notifications dropped by 
        up to 41 percent, setting progress back by up to 12 years.
            (5) Failure to properly diagnose and treat TB can lead to 
        death and can exacerbate antimicrobial resistance, a key 
        contributor to rising cases of multi-drug-resistant TB and 
        extensively drug-resistant TB, and increasing the probability 
        of the introduction of resistant TB into new geographic areas.
            (6) TB programs have played a central role in responding to 
        COVID-19, including through leveraging the expertise of medical 
        staff with expertise in TB and lung diseases, the repurposing 
        of TB hospitals, and the use of the TB rapid molecular testing 
        platforms and x-ray equipment for multiple purposes, including 
        COVID-19.
            (7) With sufficient resourcing, TB program expertise, 
        infection control, laboratory capacity, active case finding and 
        contact investigation can serve as platforms for respiratory 
        pandemic response against existing and new infectious 
        respiratory disease without disrupting ongoing TB programs and 
        activities.
            (8) Globally, only about \1/2\ of the $13,000,000,000 
        required annually, as outlined in the Stop TB Partnership's 
        Global Plan to End TB, is currently available.
            (9) On September 26, 2018, the United Nations convened the 
        first High-Level Meeting of the General Assembly on the Fight 
        Against Tuberculosis, during which 120 countries--
                    (A) signed a Political Declaration to accelerate 
                progress against TB, including through commitments to 
                increase funding for TB prevention, diagnosis, 
                treatment and research and development programs, and 
                ambitious goals to successfully treat 40,000,000 people 
                with active TB and prevent at least 30,000,000 from 
                becoming ill with TB between 2018 and 2022; and
                    (B) committed to ``ending the epidemic in all 
                countries, and pledge[d] to provide leadership and to 
                work together to accelerate our national and global 
                collective actions, investments and innovations 
                urgently to fight this preventable and treatable 
                disease'', as reflected in United Nations General 
                Assembly Resolution A/RES/73/3.
            (10) The United States Government continues to be a lead 
        funder of global TB research and development, contributing 44 
        percent of the total $915,000,000 in global funding in 2020, 
        and can catalyze more investments from other countries.
            (11) Working with governments and partners around the 
        world, USAID's TB programming has saved 66,000,000 lives, 
        demonstrating the effectiveness of United States programs and 
        activities.
            (12) On September 26, 2018, the USAID Administrator 
        announced a new performance-based Global Accelerator to End TB, 
        aimed at catalyzing investments to meet the treatment target 
        set by the United Nations High-Level Meeting, further 
        demonstrating the critical role that United States leadership 
        and assistance plays in the fight to eliminate TB.
            (13) It is essential to ensure that efforts among United 
        States Government agencies, partner nations, international 
        organizations, nongovernmental organizations, the private 
        sector, and other actors are complementary and not duplicative 
        in order to achieve the goal of ending the TB epidemic in all 
        countries.

SEC. 3. UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO END TUBERCULOSIS.

    Section 104B of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2151b-3) is amended to read as follows:

        continuing challenge.
            ``(2) Additional tools and resources are required to 
        effectively diagnose, prevent, and treat TB.
            ``(3) Effectively resourced TB programs can serve as a

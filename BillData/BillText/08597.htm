                                 A BILL


 
To amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to provide for 
 coverage of services furnished by freestanding emergency centers, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Care Improvement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) To expand provider capacity to respond to the COVID-19 
        pandemic, in April of 2020 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
        Services issued a waiver allowing freestanding emergency 
        centers (FECs) to enroll as Medicare-certified hospitals and 
        receive Medicare reimbursement for the duration of the COVID-19 
        public health emergency.
            (2) FECs are fully licensed emergency departments that are 
        staffed by both Emergency Medicine trained physicians and 
        registered nurses who are on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a 
        week, and possess licensed pharmacies, clinical laboratories, 
        and advanced imaging services. FECs are State-licensed, and 
        adhere to the same standards and provide the same level of care 
        as Hospital Based Emergency Rooms, including State EMTALA 
        regulations on treating all patients.
            (3) Over 110 FECs, mostly located in Texas, have enrolled 
        and provided high-quality emergency services for all kinds of 
        emergency conditions at significant savings to the Medicare 
        program to thousands of Medicare beneficiaries.
            (4) An actuarial study of Medicare claims data found that 
        FECs did not increase overall utilization of emergency care 
        services and saved the Medicare program 21.8 percent in lower 
        emergency care payments for patients of similar acuity.

SEC. 3. COVERAGE OF FREESTANDING EMERGENCY CENTERS UNDER MEDICARE AND 
              MEDICAID.

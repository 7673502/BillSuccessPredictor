            (1) Chinese entity of concern.--The term ``Chinese entity 
        of concern'' means any university or college in the People's 
        Republic of China that--
                    (A) is involved in the implementation of military-
                civil fusion;
                    (B) participates in the Chinese defense industrial

                    (C) is affiliated with the Chinese State 
                Administration for Science, Technology and Industry for 
                the National Defense;
                    (D) receives funding from any organization 
                subordinate to the Central Military Commission of the 
                Chinese Communist Party; or
                    (E) provides support to any security, defense, 
                police, or intelligence organization of the Government 
                of the People's Republic of China or the Chinese 
                Communist Party.
            (2) Confucius institute.--The term ``Confucius Institute'' 
        means a cultural institute funded by the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China.
            (3) Institution of higher education.--The term 
        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given such 
        term in section 102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
        U.S.C. 1002).
            (4) Relationship.--The term ``relationship'' means, with 
        respect to an institution of higher education, any contract

        Chinese entity of concern.
    (b) Restrictions on Institutions of Higher Education.--Beginning 
with the first fiscal year that begins after the date that is 12 months 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland 
Security shall ensure that an institution of higher education (referred 
to in this section as an ``institution'') which has a relationship with 
a Confucius Institute is ineligible to receive any Science and 
Technology or Research and Development funds from the Department of 
Homeland Security, unless the institution terminates the relationship 
between the institution and such Confucius Institute. Upon the 
termination of such a relationship, the institution at issue shall be 
eligible to receive Science and Technology or Research and Development 
funds from the Department of Homeland Security.
    (c) Chinese Entities of Concern Relationship Disclosures.--
Beginning on the date that is 12 months after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall require each 
institution of higher education which has a relationship with a Chinese 
entity of concern that is seeking or receives Science and Technology or 
Research and Development funds from the Department of Homeland Security 
to notify the Secretary of such relationship. Such notification shall 
include the following with respect to such relationship:
            (1) An identification of the Chinese entity of concern.

        Chinese entity of concern.
    (d) Assistance.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide 
outreach and, upon request, technical assistance to institutions of 
higher education relating to compliance with this Act. In carrying out 
this subsection, the Secretary shall provide particular attention to 
institutions assisting historically Black colleges and universities (as 
such term is defined in part B of section 322(2) of the Higher

        States.
            (2) Renewal.--The Secretary of Homeland Security may 
        annually renew a waiver issued pursuant to paragraph (1) if the 
        Secretary determines such is in the national security interests 
        of the United States.
            (3) Notification.--If the Secretary of Homeland Security 
        issues or renews a waiver pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2), 
        respectively, not later than 30 days after such issuance or 
        renewal, as the case may be, the Secretary shall provide 
        written notification to the Committee on Homeland Security of 
        the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland 
        Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding such 
        issuance or renewal, including a justification relating 
        thereto.

        pursuant to subsection (d).

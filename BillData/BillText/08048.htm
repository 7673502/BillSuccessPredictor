SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Solitary Confinement Study and 
Reform Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) develop and implement national standards for the use of 
        solitary confinement to ensure that it is used infrequently and 
        only under extreme circumstances;
            (2) establish a more humane and constitutionally sound 
        practice of segregated detention or solitary confinement in 
        correctional facilities;
            (3) accelerate the development of best practices and make 
        reforming solitary confinement a top priority in each 
        correctional facility at the Federal and State levels;
            (4) increase the available data and information on the 
        incidence of solitary confinement, consequently improving the 
        management and administration of correctional facilities;
            (5) standardize the definitions used for collecting data on 
        the incidence of solitary confinement;
            (6) increase the accountability of correctional facility 
        officials who fail to design and implement humane and 
        constitutionally sound solitary confinement practices;
            (7) protect the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of 
        incarcerated individuals at correctional facilities; and
            (8) reduce the costs that solitary confinement imposes on 
        interstate commerce.

    (e) Recommendations.--
            (1) In general.--As part of the report submitted under 
        subsection (d)(3), the Commission shall provide the Attorney 
        General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services with 
        recommended national standards for significantly reducing the 
        use of solitary confinement in correctional facilities.
            (2) Matters included.--The information provided under 
        paragraph (1) shall include recommended national standards 
        relating to--
                    (A) how authorities can progress toward 
                significantly limiting the utilization of solitary 
                confinement so that an incarcerated individual may be 
                placed in solitary confinement only under extreme 
                emergency circumstances, as a last resort, for as short 
                a time as possible, subject to independent review, and 
                pursuant to the authorization of a competent authority;
                    (B) methods that can be employed to ensure that the 
                duration of solitary confinement of an incarcerated 
                individual at an institution can be limited to hours at 
                a time for purposes of emergency de-escalation, except 
                that if the head of a correctional facility makes an 
                individualized determination that the incarcerated 
                individual cannot be safely returned to the general 
                population, the head of the correctional facility may 
                continue to segregate the incarcerated individual from 
                the general population without the use of solitary 
                confinement, while ensuring that the incarcerated 
                individual has access to the type and hours of out-of-
                cell congregate programming, activities, and engagement 
                comparable to the general population, in accordance 
                with best practices and model programs for improving 
                people's well-being and reducing violence in youth and 
                adult correctional settings, non-correctional settings, 
                and other mental health settings, and in accordance 
                with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules on the 
                Treatment of Prisoners;
                    (C) ensuring that prior to being classified, 
                assigned, or subject to long-term segregation, an 
                incarcerated individual shall be entitled to a 
                meaningful hearing on the reason for and duration of 
                the confinement and have access to legal counsel for 
                such hearings;
                    (D) ensuring that indefinite sentencing of an 
                incarcerated individual to long-term segregation will 
                not be allowed and that the incarcerated individual 
                will be afforded a meaningful review of the segregation 
                at least once every 30 days that the incarcerated 
                individual remains in segregation and that correctional 
                facility officials must record and provide a transcript 
                of the review proceedings for the incarcerated 
                individual under review to the incarcerated individual 
                or the incarcerated individual's designee;
                    (E) ensuring that correctional facility officials 
                design and implement programming that allows 
                incarcerated individuals subject to long-term 
                segregation to earn placement in less restrictive 
                housing through positive behavior;
                    (F) ensuring that protective custody and other 
                custody designations designed to protect vulnerable 
                incarcerated individuals, regardless of the reason for 
                vulnerability, are not characterized by solitary 
                confinement or other type of isolation conditions, and 
                that incarcerated individuals placed in protective 
                custody have access to programs, privileges, education, 
                and work opportunities commensurate with general 
                population incarcerated individuals to the extent 
                possible;
                    (G) ensuring that correctional facility officials 
                improve access to mental health treatment for 
                incarcerated individuals in solitary confinement;
                    (H) ensuring that correctional facility officials 
                do all that is feasible to make certain that 
                incarcerated individuals are not held in solitary 
                confinement for any duration;
                    (I) ensuring that correctional facility officials 
                develop alternative methods to manage issues with 
                incarcerated individuals other than solitary 
                confinement;
                    (J) ensuring that correctional facility officers do 
                all that is feasible to make certain that incarcerated 
                individuals with mental health, physical, or cognitive 
                disabilities are not held in solitary confinement for 
                any duration;
                    (K) ensuring that correctional facility officers do 
                all that is feasible to make certain that pregnant and 
                post-partum women are not held in solitary confinement 
                for any duration;
                    (L) ensuring that correctional facility officers 
                work towards systems that limit the circumstances and 
                conditions under which juveniles are placed in solitary 
                confinement, in compliance with section 5043 of title 
                18, United States Code;

                incarcerated individuals, on the use of solitary 
                confinement, segregation, and any other form of 
                restrictive housing in correctional facilities in the 
                jurisdiction, including--
                            (i) the average daily number and percentage 
                        of incarcerated individuals in each placement;
                            (ii) the total number of such placements;
                            (iii) the reasons for such placements;

                use of solitary confinement and segregation; and
                    (O) such other matters as may reasonably be related

                correctional facilities.
            (3) Limitation.--The Commission shall not propose a 
        recommended standard that would impose substantial additional

        facilities, and shall seek to propose standards that reduce the 
        costs of incarceration at such facilities.
    (f) Consultation With Accreditation Organizations.--In developing

        the State correctional facility population of such State bears 
        to the total correctional facility population of all the 
        participating States.

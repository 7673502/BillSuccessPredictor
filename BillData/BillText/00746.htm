To require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to secure medical opinions 
for veterans with service-connected disabilities who die from COVID-19 
  to determine whether their service-connected disabilities were the

COVID-19 Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. MEDICAL OPINIONS FOR CERTAIN VETERANS WITH SERVICE-CONNECTED 
              DISABILITIES WHO DIE OF COVID-19.

    In any case in which a veteran with one or more service-connected 
disabilities dies, the death certificate identifies Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID-19) as the principal or contributory cause of death, the 
death certificate does not clearly identify any of the service-
connected disabilities as the principal or contributory cause of death, 
and a claim for benefits is filed with respect to the veteran under 
chapter 13 of title 38, Unites States Code, the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs shall secure a medical opinion to determine if a service-
connected disability was the principal or contributory cause of death.

SEC. 2. INELIGIBILITY FOR DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANTS WITH RESPECT TO 
              DEFUNDING A MUNICIPAL POLICE DEPARTMENT.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, to be 
eligible for any grant funding from the Department of Justice, a local 
government applying for such a grant shall certify to the Attorney 
General that the municipal police department of such local government 
has not been defunded in either the current or prior fiscal year in 
which the local government is applying for such grant.
    (b) Exceptions.--
            (1) Inability to pay.--A local government that demonstrates 
        that the municipal police department was defunded because of an 
        inability to pay, including demonstrating decreases throughout 
        the budget of the local government, shall be eligible for grant 
        funding from the Department of Justice.
            (2) Waiver of sovereign immunity.--A local government that 
        has defunded the municipal police department shall be eligible 
        for grant funding from the Department of Justice if such local 
        government waives sovereign immunity with respect to a cause of 
        action against the local government by an individual for 
        property damages or damages for personal injuries as a result 
        of the municipal police department being defunded.
    (c) Local Government Defined.--In this section, the term ``local 
government'' means a municipality, city, town, township, a rural 
community, or unincorporated town or village.

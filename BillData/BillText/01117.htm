    To amend the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National 
  Historical Park Establishment Act of 2000 to provide for additional 
         areas to be added to the park, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ROSIE THE RIVETER/WORLD WAR II HOME FRONT NATIONAL 
              HISTORICAL PARK ADDITIONS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Rosie the Riveter 
National Historic Site Expansion Act''.
    (b) Additions.--The Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front 
National Historical Park Establishment Act of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 410ggg et 
seq.) is amended as follows:
            (1) In section 2(b), by adding at the end the following: 
        ``Not later than 180 days after areas are added to the park 
        administratively or by Federal law, the Secretary shall update 
        the map to include the added areas.''.
            (2) By adding at the end of section 2, the following:
    ``(c) Additional Areas Included.--In addition to areas included 
under subsection (b), the park shall include the following:
            ``(1) The Nystrom Elementary School-The Maritime Building, 
        as listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
            ``(2) Such other areas as the Secretary deems 
        appropriate.''.
            (3) By amending section 3(e)(2) to read as follows:
            ``(2) Other property.--Within the boundaries of the park, 
        the Secretary may acquire lands, improvements, waters, or 
        interests therein, by donation, purchase, exchange or transfer. 
        Any lands, or interests therein, owned by the State of 
        California or any political subdivision thereof, may be 
        acquired only by donation. When any tract of land is only 
        partly within such boundaries, the Secretary may acquire all or 
        any portion of the land outside of such boundaries in order to 
        minimize the payment of severance costs. Land so acquired 
        outside of the boundaries may be exchanged by the Secretary for 
        non-Federal lands within the boundaries. Any portion of land 
        acquired outside the boundaries and not used for exchange shall 
        be reported to the General Services Administration for disposal 
        for not less than fair market value under chapter 1 of title 
        40, United States Code.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

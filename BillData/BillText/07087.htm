  lodging to transient guests to include all mandatory fees and other 
charges in the advertised rental rates for such lodging, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. LODGING FEE DISCLOSURES.

    (a) In General.--A person who operates an inn, hotel, motel, or 
other establishment that provides lodging to transient guests shall 
include all mandatory fees and other charges in any advertised rental 
rate for such lodging.
    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) does not require the inclusion in an 
advertised rental rate of any tax, fee, or other charge assessed, or 
required to be assessed, by a government entity.
    (c) Enforcement.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        this section shall be treated as a violation of a regulation 
        under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act 
        (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)) regarding unfair or deceptive acts or 
        practices.
            (2) Powers of commission.--The Federal Trade Commission 
        shall enforce this section in the same manner, by the same 
        means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as 
        though all applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into 
        and made a part of this section. Any person who violates this 
        section shall be subject to the penalties and entitled to the 
        privileges and immunities provided in the Federal Trade 
        Commission Act.
    (d) Mandatory Defined.--In this section, the term ``mandatory'' 
means, with respect to a fee or other charge assessed in connection 
with the rental of lodging, that the fee or other charge must be paid 
as a condition of renting such lodging.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

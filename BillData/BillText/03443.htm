    ``(2)(A) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1) of this section, in any 
case in which an individual is entitled to a monthly insurance benefit 
under such subsection based on a disability that is attributable to an 
injury for which the individual was awarded the Purple Heart, such 
individual shall be deemed to continue to be entitled to such benefit 
without regard to the individual's termination month, except that 
payment of such benefit for any month shall be subject to the reduction 
described in subparagraph (B).
    ``(B)(i) Any benefit described in subparagraph (A) otherwise 
payable to an individual described in such subparagraph for a month 
shall be reduced by $1 for each $4 by which the individual's earnings 
derived from services for such month exceeds the amount specified for 
such month in clause (ii), except that such benefit may not be reduced 
below $0.
    ``(ii) The amount specified in this clause with respect to an 
individual for a month is the amount of earnings derived from services, 
applicable to the individual for such month under subsection (d)(4)(A), 
sufficient to demonstrate the individual's ability to engage in 
substantial gainful activity.
    ``(C) In the case of a benefit otherwise payable to an individual 
for a month under section 202 on the basis of the wages and self-
employment income of an individual whose benefit is reduced pursuant to 
subparagraph (B), such benefit shall be reduced for such month by the 
same proportion as the reduction made pursuant to subparagraph (B).''.

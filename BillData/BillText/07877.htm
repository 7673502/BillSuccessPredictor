 To reauthorize the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa 
Safety Reauthorization Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Section 1402 of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act 
(15 U.S.C. 8001) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 1402. FINDINGS.

    ``Congress finds the following:
            ``(1) Drowning is a public health crisis. Drowning can 
        happen in seconds, is often silent, and can happen to anyone, 
        anytime there is access to water.
            ``(2) About 11 people die each day from drowning in the 
        United States, and drowning kills nearly 4,000 people each year 
        in the United States.
            ``(3) Of injury-related deaths, drowning is the first 
        leading cause of accidental death in children aged 1 to 4 in 
        the United States, and the second leading cause of accidental 
        death in children aged 1 to 14 in the United States.
            ``(4) Drowning death rates for Black people are 1.5 times 
        higher than the rates for White people, and drowning death 
        rates for American Indian people ages 29 and younger are 2 
        times higher than the rates for White people in the same age 
        range.
            ``(5) People in rural areas of the United States are 26 
        percent more likely to die by drowning than people in urban 
        areas of the United States.
            ``(6) Research shows that the installation and proper use 
        of barriers or fencing, as well as additional layers of 
        protection, such as swimming lessons, could substantially 
        reduce the number of childhood fatal and nonfatal drownings in 
        residential swimming pools.''.

SEC. 3. COVERED ENTITY DEFINED.

    (a) In General.--Section 1403 of the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and 
Spa Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 8002) is amended--

        as paragraphs (6), (8), (9), (10), and (11), respectively;

        5130).''; and

        the following:
            ``(7) Nonprofit organization.--The term `nonprofit 
        organization' means an organization that--

                        United States; and
                    (B) whether any such rule contributed to--
                            (i) an increase in inflation in the United 
                        States; or

                domestic product in the two quarters preceding the 
                effective date; or
                    (B) if the Director has not issued two consecutive 
                reports on the gross domestic product of the United 
                States indicating a decline in such gross domestic 
                product in the two quarters preceding the effective

                            (i) The first date on which the Director 
                        determines that the gross domestic product of 
                        the United States declined in the two quarters 
                        preceding such date.
                            (ii) The publication date of the first 
                        monthly report published by the Bureau of Labor 
                        Statistics that shows an increase of 5 percent

                                 A BILL


 
   To establish the National Counter Human Trafficking Research and 
            Development Initiative, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Counter Human Trafficking Research 
and Development Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Trafficking in persons is a multi-billion dollar 
        transnational illicit enterprise.
            (2) Globally, millions of people, including children, are 
        trafficked each year through sexual exploitation or forced 
        labor.
            (3) Human trafficking impacts every country around the 
        world, including the United States, whether as the country of 
        origin, transit, or destination, or combination of all three.
            (4) Science and technology have important roles to play in 
        combatting human trafficking. The 2019 United Nations 
        Interagency Coordination Group Against Trafficking in Persons 
        report states that technology can help practitioners combat 
        trafficking, such as by aiding investigations, enhancing 
        prosecutions, raising awareness, providing service to victims, 
        and shedding light on the make-up and operation of trafficking 
        networks.
            (5) Limited data sources and data fragmentation are major 
        barriers to anti-trafficking efforts, both domestically and 
        globally, and has limited the ability to carry out rigorous 
        study of human trafficking.
            (6) Key areas of need for research and technology 
        development to counter human trafficking are measuring the 
        prevalence of trafficking, identifying effective mechanisms for 
        disrupting human trafficking networks, establishing metrics of 
        success for ongoing efforts to combat trafficking, 
        understanding long and short-term needs of victims and 
        survivors, vulnerability reduction, trafficking prevention and 
        demand reduction, understanding how legitimate businesses may 
        enable human trafficking, understanding all forms of 
        trafficking, including labor trafficking, the nature and 
        characteristics of victims of human trafficking in the United 
        States, understanding illicit activities and corruption 
        associated with human trafficking, and evaluating the efficacy 
        and impact of anti-trafficking interventions.
            (7) To improve efforts to counter human trafficking, the 
        Federal Government must address major barriers to human 
        trafficking research and technology development by improving 
        and increasing coordination of research efforts and information 
        sharing among researchers, Federal agencies, law enforcement, 
        local, State, and Tribal governments, private sector, survivors 
        and survivor organizations, policymakers, international 
        partners, and other stakeholder communities.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION.

    In this Act, the term ``trafficking'' has the meaning given the 
term ``severe forms of trafficking in persons'' in section 103 of the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7102).

        and behavioral sciences to accelerate scientific understanding 
        and technological innovation that contributes to the 
        prevention, identification, and disruption of human trafficking 
        within and across communities, including urban, rural, and 
        indigenous and tribal communities, including--
                    (A) research and development on tools for measuring

        indicators and signatures;
            (4) improving Federal agency coordination of research and 
        development activities to counter human trafficking;
            (5) improving the sharing of human trafficking data and 
        information among Federal agencies and between public and

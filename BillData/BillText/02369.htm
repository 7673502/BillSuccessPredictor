                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to provide 
rebates for expenditures for energy efficient electrotechnologies that 
   are used to replace fossil fuel-fired technologies, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthening Manufacturing in 
America through Responsible Transitions to Electric Act'' or the 
``SMART Electric Act''.

SEC. 2. REBATE PROGRAM FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT ELECTROTECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Energy efficient electrotechnology.--The term ``energy 
        efficient electrotechnology'' means--
                    (A) any electric technology that, when used instead 
                of a fossil fuel-fired technology in an industrial 
                process results in--
                            (i) energy efficiency, or production 
                        efficiency, gains; or
                            (ii) environmental benefits; or
                    (B) any electric technology that, when used instead 
                of a fossil fuel-fired technology in an industrial 
                application results in--
                            (i) improvements in on-site logistics or 
                        material handling; and
                            (ii) energy efficiency gains and 
                        environmental benefits.
            (2) Qualified entity.--The term ``qualified entity'' means 
        an industrial or manufacturing facility, commercial building, 
        or a utility or energy service company.
            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Energy.
    (b) Establishment.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall establish a program to 
provide rebates in accordance with this section.
    (c) Rebates.--The Secretary may provide a rebate under the program 
established under subsection (b) to the owner or operator of a 
qualified entity for expenditures made by the owner or operator of the 
qualified entity for an energy efficient electrotechnology that is used 
to replace a fossil fuel-fired technology.
    (d) Requirements.--To be eligible to receive a rebate under this 
section, the owner or operator of a qualified entity shall submit to 
the Secretary an application demonstrating--
            (1) that the owner or operator of the qualified entity 
        purchased an energy efficient electrotechnology;
            (2) the energy efficiency gains, production efficiency 
        gains, and environmental benefits, as applicable, resulting 
        from use of the energy efficient electrotechnology--
                    (A) as measured by a qualified professional or 
                verified by the energy efficient electrotechnology 
                manufacturer, as applicable; or
                    (B) as determined by the Secretary;
            (3) that the fossil fuel-fired technology replaced by the 
        energy efficient electrotechnology has been permanently 
        decommissioned and scrapped; and
            (4) that all laborers and mechanics who were involved in 
        the installation or maintenance, or construction or renovation 
        to support such installation or maintenance, of the energy 
        efficient electrotechnology, or the decommissioning and 
        scrapping of the fossil fuel-fired technology replaced by the 
        energy efficient electrotechnology, and who were employed by 
        the owner or operator of the qualified entity, or contractors 
        or subcontractors at any tier thereof, were paid wages at rates 
        not less than those prevailing on projects of a character 
        similar in the locality as determined by the Secretary of Labor 
        in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, 
        United States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Davis-Bacon 
        Act'').
    (e) Limitation.--The Secretary may not provide a rebate under the 
program established under subsection (b) to an owner or operator of a 
qualified entity for expenditures made by the owner or operator of the 
qualified entity for an energy efficient electrotechnology that is used 
to replace a fossil fuel-fired technology if the Secretary determines 
that such expenditures were necessary for the owner or operator to 
comply with Federal or State law.
    (f) Authorized Amount of Rebate.--The amount of a rebate provided 
under this section shall be not less than 30 percent, and not more than 
50 percent, of the overall cost of the energy efficient 
electrotechnology, including installation costs.
    (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $100,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2026.

        TITLE II--DISCLOSURE OF SUBSIDIES BY FOREIGN ADVERSARIES

SEC. 201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Foreign subsidies, which can take the form of direct 
        subsidies, grants, loans (including below-market loans), loan 
        guarantees, tax concessions, preferential government 
        procurement policies, or government ownership or control, can 
        distort the competitive process by enabling the subsidized firm 
        to submit a bid higher than other firms in the market, or 
        otherwise change the incentives of the firm in ways that 
        undermine competition following an acquisition.
            (2) Foreign subsidies are particularly problematic when 
        granted by countries or entities that constitute a strategic or 
        economic threat to United States interests.
            (3) The Made in China 2025 plan, states that the Chinese 
        Communist Party will ``support enterprises to carry out mergers 
        and acquisitions (M&A), equity investment, and venture capital 
        overseas''.
            (4) The 2020 report to Congress from the bipartisan U.S.-
        China Economic and Security Review Commission concluded that 
        the Chinese Government subsidizes companies with a goal of 
        their expanding into the United States and other countries, 
        finding that ``[t]his process assists Chinese national 
        champions in surpassing and supplanting global market 
        leaders''. The report warns that the risk is particularly acute 
        when it comes to emerging technologies, where China seeks to 
        ``surpass and displace the United States altogether [and that] 
        [f]ailure to appreciate the gravity of this challenge and 
        defend U.S. competitiveness would be dire . . . [and] risks 
        setting back U.S. economic and technological progress for 
        decades''.
            (5) In remarks before the Hudson Institute on December 8, 
        2020, FTC Commissioner Noah Phillips stated, ``[O]ne area where 
        antitrust needs to reckon with the strategic interests of other 
        nations is when we scrutinize mergers or conduct involving 
        state-owned entities . . . companies that are controlled, to 
        varying degrees, by the state . . . [and] often are a 
        government tool for implementing industrial policies or to 
        protect national security''.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to require parties 
providing pre-merger notifications to include in the notification 
required under section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a) 
information concerning subsidies they receive from countries or 
entities that are strategic or economic threats to the United States.

SEC. 202. MERGERS INVOLVING FOREIGN GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES.

    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``foreign entity of 
concern'' has the meaning given the term in section 40207 of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (42 U.S.C. 18741(a)).
    (b) Accounting for Foreign Government Subsidies.--A person required 
to file a notification under section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 
18a) that received a subsidy from a foreign entity of concern shall 
include in such notification content regarding such subsidy.
    (c) Authority of Antitrust Regulators.--The Federal Trade 
Commission, with the concurrence of the Assistant Attorney General in 
charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, and in 
consultation with the Chairperson of the Committee on Foreign 
Investment in the United States, the Secretary of Commerce, the Chair 
of the United States International Trade Commission, the United States 
Trade Representative, and the heads of other appropriate agencies, and 
by rule in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code, 
shall require that the notification required under subsection (b) be in 
such form and contain such documentary material and information 
relevant to a proposed acquisition as is necessary and appropriate to 
enable the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General 
in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice to 
determine whether such acquisition may, if consummated, violate the 
antitrust laws.
    (d) Effective Date.--Subsection (b) shall take effect on the date 
on which the rule described in subsection (c) takes effect.

            TITLE III--VENUE FOR STATE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT

SEC. 301. VENUE FOR STATE ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT.

    Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (g) by inserting ``or a State'' after 
        ``United States'' and striking ``; but shall not include 
        section 4A of the Act of October 15, 1914, as added July 7, 
        1955 (69 Stat. 282; 15 U.S.C. 15a)''; and
            (2) by striking subsection (h).

            Passed the House of Representatives September 29, 2022.

            Attest:

                                             CHERYL L. JOHNSON,

                                                                 Clerk.

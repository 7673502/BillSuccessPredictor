SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Telehealth Treatment and Technology 
Act of 2022'' or the ``3T Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF TELEHEALTH AND INTERSTATE TREATMENT.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or 
State law or regulation regarding the licensure or certification of 
health care providers or the provision of telehealth services, a health 
care professional may practice within the scope of the individual's 
license, certification, or authorization described in subsection 
(i)(1)(A) through telehealth in any State, the District of Columbia, or 
any territory or possession of the United States, or any other location 
designated by the Secretary, based on the licensure, certification, or 
authorization of such individual in any one State, the District of 
Columbia, or territory or possession of the United States.
    (b) Scope of Telehealth Services.--Telehealth services authorized 
by this section include services provided to any patient regardless of 
whether the health care professional has a prior treatment relationship 
with the patient, provided that, if the health care professional does 
not have a prior treatment relationship with the patient, a new 
relationship may be established only via a written acknowledgment or 
synchronous technology.
    (c) Initiation of Telehealth Services.--Before providing telehealth 
services authorized by this section, the health care professional 
shall--
            (1) verify the identification of the patient receiving 
        health services;
            (2) obtain oral or written acknowledgment from the patient 
        (or legal representative of the patient) to perform telehealth 
        services, and if such acknowledgment is oral, make a record of 
        such acknowledgment; and
            (3) obtain or confirm an alternative method of contacting 
        the patient in case of a technological failure.
    (d) Written Notice of Provision of Services.--As soon as 
practicable, but not later than 30 days after first providing services 
pursuant to this section in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction 
in which a health care professional is licensed, certified, or 
otherwise authorized, such health care professional shall provide 
written notice to the applicable licensing, certifying, or authorizing 
authority in the jurisdiction in which the health care professional 
provided such services. Such notice shall include the health care 
professional's--
            (1) name;
            (2) email address;
            (3) phone number;
            (4) State of primary license, certification, or 
        authorization; and
            (5) license, certification, or authorization type, and 
        applicable number or identifying information with respect to 
        such license, certification, or authorization.
    (e) Clarification.--Nothing in this section authorizes a health 
care professional to--
            (1) practice beyond the scope of practice authorized by--
                    (A) any State, District of Columbia, territorial, 
                or local authority in the jurisdiction in which the 
                health care professional holds a license, 
                certification, or authorization described in section 
                3(1)(A); or
                    (B) any State, District of Columbia, territorial, 
                or local authority in the jurisdiction in which the 
                patient receiving services is located;
            (2) provide any service or subset of services prohibited by 
        any such authority in the jurisdiction in which the patient 
        receiving services is located;
            (3) provide any service or subset of services in a manner 
        prohibited by any such authority the jurisdiction in which the 
        patient receiving services is located; or
            (4) provide any service or subset of services in a manner 
        other than the manner prescribed by any such authority in the 
        jurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is 
        located.
    (f) Investigative and Disciplinary Authority.--A health care 
professional providing services pursuant to the authority under this 
section shall be subject to investigation and disciplinary action by 
the licensing, certifying, or authorizing authorities in the 
jurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is located. The 
jurisdiction in which the patient receiving services is located shall 
have the authority to preclude the health care provider from practicing 
further in its jurisdiction, whether such practice is authorized by the 
laws of such jurisdiction or the authority granted under this section, 
and shall report any such preclusion to the licensing authority in the 
jurisdiction in which the health care provider is licensed, certified, 
or authorized.
    (g) Multiple Jurisdiction Licensure.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this section, a health care professional shall be subject 
to the requirements of the jurisdiction of licensure if the 
professional is licensed in the State, the District of Columbia, or 
territory or possession where the patient is located.
    (h) Interstate Licensure Compacts.--If a health care professional 
is licensed in multiple jurisdictions through an interstate licensure 
compact, with respect to services provided to a patient located in a 
jurisdiction covered by such compact, the health care professional 
shall be subject to the requirements of the compact and not this 
section.

            (1) the term ``health care professional'' means an

                State, the District of Columbia, or a territory or 
                possession of the United States, for any health

        mental health assessment, diagnosis, treatment, intervention, 
        consultation, supervision, and information across distance.

SEC. 3. REVISION OF HIPAA REGULATIONS TO ENSURE PATIENT ACCESS TO 
              TELEHEALTH SERVICES.

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall revise the HIPAA privacy 
regulation (as defined in section 1180(b)(3) of the Social Security Act 
(42 U.S.C. 1320d-9(b)(3))) to ensure that, with respect to services 
furnished by a health care provider via telehealth on or after the 
first day following the end of the emergency period described in 
section 1135(g)(1)(B) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5(g)(1)(B)), such 
provider may so furnish such services using any non-public facing audio 
or video communication product (as such term is used for purposes of 
the notice entitled ``Notification of Enforcement Discretion for 
Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 Nationwide Public 
Health Emergency'' as published by the Office of Civil Rights of the 
Department of Health and Human Services).

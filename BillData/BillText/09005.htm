     bill; which was referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry out a pilot 
  program for the cognitive care of veterans, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Innovative Cognitive Care for 
Veterans Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a 2020 study by the Office of the 
        Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and 
        Planning of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it is projected 
        that the number of veterans with Alzheimer's dementia will 
        increase by 28.9 percent between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal 
        year 2033, amounting to an estimated 48,000 new patients with 
        cognitive impairments.
            (2) The cost of expenditures of the Department of Veterans 
        Affairs for long-term care is growing rapidly, as demonstrated 
        by a 2020 Government Accountability Office report that 
        estimates such expenditures are projected to double to 
        $14,300,000,000 by 2037.
            (3) As described in the report specified in paragraph (2), 
        the Department of Veterans Affairs also faces both a current 
        and incoming workforce shortage, in addition to other 
        challenges relating to the provision of long-term care services 
        to the more than 2,800,000 estimated veterans who are enrolled 
        in the patient enrollment system of the Department established 
        and operated under section 1705(a) of title 38, United States 
        Code, and live in rural areas.
            (4) As observed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, 
        veterans can also be prone to unique factors that increase the 
        risk for future cognitive impairment. For example, it has been 
        found that veterans who served during the Vietnam era and, 
        while so serving, were exposed to Agent Orange are nearly twice 
        as likely as those without such exposure to receive a diagnosis 
        of dementia.
            (5) This data compels the United States Government to do 
        more for veterans and their cognitive care.

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR ADDRESSING 
              COGNITIVE DISORDERS AMONG VETERANS.

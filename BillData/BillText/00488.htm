   To prohibit a moratorium on mineral development on Bureau of Land 
  Management and National Forest System land, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saving America's Mines Act''.

SEC. 2. PROTECTING THE EXTRACTION OF CRITICAL MINERALS IN THE UNITED 
              STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is the policy of the United States Forest Service to 
        foster and encourage mineral development on National Forest 
        System lands in an ecologically sound manner.
            (2) Mineral development is an important land use within the 
        multiple-use mandate of the Bureau of Land Management.
            (3) Development of the minerals of the United States is 
        necessary for batteries, energy production, national security, 
        and health care technology.
            (4) Unilateral mineral withdrawals on Federal lands 
        increases the reliance of the United States on countries with 
        horrific labor and environmental standards, including Russia, 
        China, and the Congo.
    (b) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
President or Secretary concerned may not declare a moratorium on or 
reverse any existing lease, permit, or claim, on the mining and 
extraction of any critical mineral or common varieties of sand, stone, 
and gravel on National Forest System or Bureau of Land Management land 
unless specifically authorized by an Act of Congress, or upon the 
lessee, permittee, or claimant's failure to comply with any of the 
provisions of its agreement.

                            (ii) the supply chain of which is

                                    (I) restrictions associated with

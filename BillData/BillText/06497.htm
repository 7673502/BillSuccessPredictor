        principles, and a coordinated cybersecurity and system 
        management strategy that employs continuous monitoring, risk-
        based access controls, or system security automation techniques 
        to address the cybersecurity principle that threats exist both 
        inside and outside traditional network boundaries with an 
        assumption that a breach is inevitable or has likely already 
        occurred, and therefore employs least-privileged access for 
        network or system users while monitoring for anomalous or 
        malicious activity.

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to update the definition of 
                    rifles, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Individual Sovereignty 
Through Our Laws Act'' or the ``PISTOL Act''.

SEC. 2. UPDATED RIFLE DEFINITION UNDER NATIONAL FIREARMS ACT.

    Section 5845(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to 
read as follows:
    ``(c) Rifle.--The term `rifle' means a weapon originally designed 
or redesigned, made or remade, and originally intended by its maker or 
manufacturer to be fired from the shoulder and designed or redesigned 
and made or remade to use the energy of the explosive in a fixed 
cartridge to fire only a single projectile through a rifled bore for 
each single pull of the trigger, and shall include any such weapon 
which may be readily restored to fire a fixed cartridge. For purposes 
of the preceding sentence, such term shall not include a pistol 
equipped with a rear brace or rear attachment which can be used to 
assist the shooter in controlling the pistol, even if such brace or 
attachment can also be placed against the shoulder.''.

SEC. 3. UPDATED PISTOL DEFINITION UNDER CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

    Within 60 days of the date of the enactment of this section, the 
Attorney General shall amend subpart B of part 479 of subchapter B of 
chapter II of title 27, Code of Federal Regulations to clarify that a 
pistol has the following definition:
``Pistol. A concealable weapon originally designed, made, and intended 
to fire a projectile (bullet) from one or more barrels when held by a 
user, and having (a) a chamber(s) that is an integral part of, or 
permanently aligned with, a bore(s); and (b) one or more short stocks 
designed to be gripped by the user with said stocks at an angle to and 
extending below the line of the bore(s). The presence or absence of 
rear mounted braces or attachments which can assist a user in 
controlling the pistol shall not cause a firearm that otherwise meets 
this definition from being considered a pistol.''
                                 &lt;all&gt;

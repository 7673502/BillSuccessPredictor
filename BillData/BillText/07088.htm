                                 A BILL


 
   To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the Defenders of Ukraine, 
 collectively, in recognition of their crucial role in the defense of 
   the free democracy of Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked war of 
                              aggression.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Defenders of Ukraine Congressional 
Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1991, Ukraine declared independence from the Union 
        of Soviet Socialist Republics, key to the dissolution of the 
        Soviet Union. Soon after, Ukraine disposed of the world's third 
        largest nuclear arsenal.
            (2) In April 2014, the Russian Federation annexed Crimea 
        and invaded the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine; 
        this initial conflict claimed approximately 14,000 lives.
            (3) On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation expanded 
        its war against Ukraine, launching a further unprovoked full-
        scale invasion of the peaceful, independent country.
            (4) In response to this unprovoked invasion, hundreds of 
        thousands of Ukrainians have heroically volunteered to defend 
        their country, joining its Armed Forces and taking up arms 
        against Russian Armed Forces.
            (5) Russia's unjustifiable invasion has claimed thousands 
        of innocent lives, including children and the elderly, through 
        the targeting of civilians and the destruction of civilian 
        infrastructure including apartment buildings, schools, 
        kindergartens, hotels, and hospitals.
            (6) Millions of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their 
        homes and country behind.
            (7) Ukrainian civilians, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the 
        democratic government, and its elected and civilian officials 
        have been effective in disrupting the Russian invasion, 
        blocking the enemy using a wide range of methods including 
        direct combat, dismantling nearby road signs, using cranes to 
        move cement blocks in the way, producing improvised petrol 
        bombs, and setting up sandbags to block roadways.
            (8) Ukrainian civilians, both armed and unarmed, have shown 
        immense bravery in their heroic attempts to disrupt the Russian 
        war efforts, with little regard for their own safety.
            (9) The courage and strength of Ukrainian citizens 
        resisting their autocratic invaders has strengthened the 
        resolve of the United States and their allies, increasing 
        support for the provision of military and humanitarian aid.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress,

the free democracy of Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked war of 
aggression.
    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the presentation 
referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter 
in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal

    (c) Disposition of Medal.--Following the presentation under 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall--
            (1) give the gold medal to the Government of Ukraine; or
            (2) if the Secretary determines that Ukraine does not have 
        a democratically elected government--
                    (A) transfer the gold medal temporarily to the 
                Smithsonian Institution for display; and
                    (B) transfer the gold medal to Ukraine after 
                determining that Ukraine does have a democratically 
                elected government.

SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.

    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck pursuant to section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the 
cost thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses.

SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.

    (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act are 
national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States 
Code.
    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, 
United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be 
considered to be numismatic items.

                                 A BILL


 
   To impose sanctions with respect to foreign persons listed in the 
     Office of the Director of National Intelligence report titled 
    ``Assessing the Saudi Government's Role in the Killing of Jamal 
                 Khashoggi'', dated February 11, 2021.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia Accountability for 
Gross Violations of Human Rights Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On October 2, 2018, Washington Post journalist Jamal 
        Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi government agents in Istanbul, 
        having reportedly been lured out of the United States by Saudi 
        diplomatic officials in Washington, DC, and monitored through 
        surveillance spyware.
            (2) On July 25, 2019, the House of Representatives passed 
        by a margin of 405-7 the Saudi Arabia Human Rights and 
        Accountability Act of 2019, which required--
                    (A) an unclassified report by the Director of 
                National Intelligence on parties responsible for 
                Khashoggi's murder, a requirement ultimately inserted 
                into and passed as part of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020;
                    (B) visa sanctions on all persons identified in 
                such report; and
                    (C) a report on human rights on Saudi Arabia.
            (3) On February 26, 2021, the Director of National 
        Intelligence released the report produced pursuant to 
        congressional direction, directly implicating Saudi Crown 
        Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other senior Saudi officials in 
        the planning and direction of Khashoggi's murder.
            (4) Section 7031(c) of division K of the Consolidated 
        Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260) requires the 
        Secretary of State to deny entry into the United States of 
        ``officials of foreign governments and their immediate family 
        members about whom the Secretary of State has credible 
        information have been involved, directly or indirectly, in . . 
        . a gross violation of human rights''.
            (5) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) 
        prohibits weapons transfers to foreign countries determined by 
        the President to be engaged in a ``pattern of acts of 
        intimidation or harassment directed against individuals in the 
        United States''.
            (6) The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et 
        seq.) directs the President to formulate and conduct 
        international security assistance programs of the United States 
        in a manner which will ``avoid identification of the United 
        States, through such programs, with governments which deny to 
        their people internationally recognized human rights and 
        fundamental freedoms''.
            (7) Secretary of State Antony Blinken has affirmed the 
        United States national interest in preventing authoritarian 
        foreign governments from reaching beyond their borders to 
        intimidate or harm persons within the United States, stating 
        that: ``As a matter of safety for all within our borders, 
        perpetrators targeting perceived dissidents on behalf of any 
        foreign government should not be permitted to reach American 
        soil. . . . We have made absolutely clear that extraterritorial 
        threats and assaults by Saudi Arabia against activists, 
        dissidents, and journalists must end.''.

    Section 2705(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to read

    ``(a) Delay of Notification.--
            ``(1) Application.--A governmental entity that is seeking a 
        warrant, order, or subpoena under section 2703 may include in 
        the application (or motion in the case of an administrative 
        subpoena authorized by a Federal or State statute or a Federal 
        or State grand jury or trial subpoena) a request to a court of 
        competent jurisdiction for an order delaying the notification 
        under section 2703 for a period of not more than 60 days.
            ``(2) Determination.--The court may not grant a request for 
        delayed notification to a customer or subscriber made under 
        paragraph (1), or an extension of such delayed notification 
        requested by the governmental entity pursuant to paragraph (3), 
        unless the court issues a written determination, based on 
        specific and articulable facts, and including written findings 
        of fact and conclusions of law, that it is substantially likely 
        that the notification of the customer or subscriber of the 
        existence of the warrant, order, or subpoena will result in--
                    ``(A) endangering the life or physical safety of an 
                individual;
                    ``(B) flight from prosecution;
                    ``(C) destruction of or tampering with evidence;
                    ``(D) intimidation of potential witnesses; or
                    ``(E) otherwise seriously jeopardizing an 
                investigation or unduly delaying a trial.
            ``(3) Extension.--The governmental entity may request one 
        or more extensions of the delay of notification granted under 
        paragraph (2) for a period of not more than 60 days for each 
        such extension. The court may only grant such an extension if 
        the court makes a written determination required under 
        paragraph (2) and the extension is in accordance with the 
        requirements of such paragraph.
            ``(4) Expiration of delay of notification.--Upon expiration 
        of the period of delay of notification and all extensions 
        thereof under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection, the

SEC. 3. PRECLUSION OF NOTICE.

    Section 2705(b) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``(b) Preclusion of Notice.--
            ``(1) Application.--A governmental entity that is seeking a 
        warrant, order, or subpoena under section 2703, when it is not 
        required to notify the customer or subscriber, or to the extent 
        that it may delay such notice pursuant to subsection (a), may 
        apply to a court for an order, subject to paragraph (6), 
        directing a provider of electronic communications service or 
        remote computing service to which a warrant, order, or subpoena 
        under section 2703 is directed not to notify any other person 
        of the existence of the warrant, order, or subpoena for a 
        period of not more than either 60 days or the period of delay 
        of notice provided under subsection (a), if any.
            ``(2) Determination.--The court may not grant a request for 
        an order made under paragraph (1), or an extension of such 
        order requested by the governmental entity pursuant to 
        paragraph (3), unless--
                    ``(A) the court issues a written determination, 
                based on specific and articulable facts, and including 
                written findings of fact and conclusions of law, that 
                it is substantially likely that not granting the

                legal representation to the customer or subscriber, to 
                avoid an adverse result as described in clause (i)

        more extensions of an order granted under paragraph (2) of not 
        more than 60 days for each such extension. The court may only 
        grant such an extension if the court makes a written 
        determination required under paragraph (2)(A) and the extension 
        is in accordance with the requirements of (2)(B).
            ``(4) Notification of changed circumstances.--If the need 
        for the order issued under paragraph (2) changes materially, 
        the governmental entity that requested the order shall notify 
        the court within 72 hours of the changed circumstances, and the 
        court shall reassess the order and modify or vacate as 
        appropriate.

        Disabilities Act), or has an illness that requires continuous 
        monitoring or is life-threatening, and complex needs include 
        issues that may arise from siblings in foster care with a 
        different parent, which could impact the ability of the 
        siblings to be placed together, or from a youth with a history 
        of trauma.

                reasonably require.
            ``(4) Use of funds.--A recipient of a grant under this 
        subsection may use the grant funds only to develop specialized 
        foster care programs which are--

                for, and place together, sibling groups described in 
                paragraph (1); and
                    ``(B) evidence-based, and proven to substantially 
                increase joint sibling placements.
            ``(5) Reporting requirement.--As a condition of receiving a 
        grant under this subsection, the grant recipient shall submit 
        to the Secretary a written report on the number of children in

        sibling groups served by the program, the methods used to place 
        children with their siblings under the program, and the 
        outcomes of the placements.
            ``(6) Regulations.--The Secretary may prescribe such 
        regulations as may be necessary to carry out this subsection.
            ``(7) Appropriation.--In addition to any amounts otherwise 
        made available to carry out this subpart, out of any money in 
        the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated,

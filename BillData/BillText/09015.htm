            (2) by striking ``500,000'' and inserting ``$1,000,000'' 
        each place it appears,
            (3) in paragraph (2)(A), in the heading, by striking

            (4) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(5) Adjustment for inflation.--In the case of a taxable 
        year beginning after 2022, the $500,000 and $1,000,000 amounts 
        in paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) shall be increased by an amount 
        equal to--
                    ``(A) such dollar amount, multiplied by
                    ``(B) the cost-of-living adjustment determined 
                under section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year in which 
                the taxable year begins, determined by substituting 
                `2021' for `2016' in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
        If any increase under this clause is not a multiple of $100,

        $100.''.

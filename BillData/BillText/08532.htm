                                 A BILL


 
To provide assistance for suspected victims and witnesses of war crimes 
                  in Ukraine, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Atrocity Crimes, Relief and 
Accountability Act'' or the ``ACRA Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Russian Government's war on Ukraine has exposed the 
        systemic lack of compliance with international humanitarian 
        law, jus in bello, on the part of the Russian military.
            (2) Ukrainian civilians have been actively targeted by 
        Russian troops, compounding their needless suffering and 
        forcing non-combatants into a state of terror.
            (3) These barbaric ways of war are inconsistent with five 
        key principles of the law of armed conflict: distinction, 
        proportionality, military necessity, hors de combat and 
        unnecessary suffering.
            (4) It is vital that Russian war criminals are brought to 
        justice.
            (5) A key component of any atrocity crimes investigation 
        includes the accurate and reliable testimony of witnesses. As 
        war crimes judicial proceedings could take years, and cross 
        many national jurisdictions, investigators must protect and 
        have ready access to potential witnesses for a long period of 
        time. Within the first 100 days of the war, over 11 million 
        people - one quarter of Ukraine's 44 million population - had 
        been displaced from their homes, including five million people 
        who fled the country.
            (6) There is reasonable concern that suspected atrocity 
        crimes victims and survivors are less likely to testify as 
        witnesses in potential legal proceedings, as they may be in 
        danger of intimidation or not stay actively engaged due to lack 
        of a support structure to sustain a lengthy investigation and 
        trial, or as a result of having fled the country in which the 
        atrocities were committed.
            (7) Legal experts and civil society groups have identified 
        an immediate need for supporting and protecting victims, 
        survivors and witnesses of atrocity crimes, no matter where 
        they are located, including ensuring such efforts are 
        coordinated to minimize the risk of retraumatizing survivors.
            (8) Without requisite support, victims and survivors are 
        less likely to accept the onerous burden of testifying against 
        criminals, undermining their ability to attain some justice for 
        their suffering, and reducing the ability to hold war criminals 
        accountable for their actions.
            (9) Therefore, it is necessary that the United States 
        assist relevant authorities and civil society groups in 
        protecting and supporting this vulnerable population within 
        Ukraine and across borders.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE FOR SUSPECTED VICTIMS AND WITNESSES 
              OF WAR CRIMES.

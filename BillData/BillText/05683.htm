              OF HOMELAND SECURITY.

    (a) Report.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Management 
        of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with 
        appropriate officials of the Department, shall submit to the 
        appropriate congressional committees a report on active 
        contracts for covered services of the Department awarded on or 
        before September 30, 2021.
            (2) Elements.--The report required under paragraph (1) 
        shall include the following:
                    (A) The criteria used by the Department to 
                determine whether contractor personnel were necessary 
                to assist the Department in carrying out its mission 
                along the United States land border with Mexico.
                    (B) An analysis of the purpose, quantity, and 
                location of contractor personnel to perform covered 
                services of the Department with respect to 
                effectively--
                            (i) addressing mission needs along such 
                        border; and
                            (ii) enhancing the capability of Department 
                        personnel to perform primary mission 
                        responsibilities, including the number of 
                        Department personnel not removed from their 
                        primary mission responsibilities by reason of 
                        the performance of covered services by 
                        contractor personnel.
                    (C) An assessment with respect to the benefits of 
                contractor personnel performing covered services, 
                including whether the performance of such services by 
                contractor personnel is more efficient or effective 
                than the performance of such services by Department 
                employees.
                    (D) An assessment of opportunities to increase the 
                efficiency of the Department with respect to 
                contracting, including whether Department-wide contract 
                vehicles for covered services would be the most cost 
                effective option for the performance of covered 
                services.
                    (E) A strategy to improve the procurement and 
                delivery of covered services through contracts during 
                the five-year period beginning on the date of the 
                enactment of this Act to achieve the best value for the 
                Department through the use of full and open competition 
                and to ensure no lapse in the performance of such 
                services.
                    (F) Recommendations based on findings resulting 
                from the analysis and assessments required in 
                subparagraphs (B) through (D).
                    (G) Any other information relating to contracts for 
                covered services that the Under Secretary determines to 
                be appropriate.
    (b) Implementation Plan.--
            (1) In general.--The Under Secretary for Management shall 
        transmit with the report required under subsection (a) a plan 
        to implement the recommendations and strategy contained in such 
        report to enhance coordination, minimize overlap, and increase 
        cost effectiveness among contracts for covered services.
            (2) Briefing.--Not later than 180 days after the date on 
        which the Under Secretary for Management submits the report 
        required under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) and the plan 
        required under paragraph (1) and every 180 days thereafter 
        until the plan is fully implemented, the Under Secretary, or 
        the designee of the Under Secretary, shall provide a briefing 
        to the appropriate congressional committees with respect to the 
        status of such implementation.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
        means--
                    (A) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House 
                of Representatives; and
                    (B) the Committee on Homeland Security and 
                Governmental Affairs of the Senate.
            (2) The term ``contract for covered services'' means a

        covered services for the Department of Homeland Security.
            (3) The term ``covered services'' means, with respect to 
        the United States land border with Mexico, any service, 
        including related to border security, provided by a contractor 
        to be used by the Department.
            Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to direct the Under 
        Secretary for Management of the Department of Homeland Security 
        to assess contracts for covered services performed by

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
      To amend title 18, United States Code, to provide for video 
   teleconferencing for certain criminal proceedings, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Courtroom Videoconferencing Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

     It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is important to modernize Federal courts to allow 
        for videoconferencing in certain criminal proceedings, which 
        flexibility Congress authorized under the CARES Act, which 
        provided for such an option at the discretion of the chief 
        judge of a district court during the national emergency 
        associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;
            (2) the efficiency and expediency gained from the 
        flexibility authorized under the CARES Act should be made 
        permanent; and
            (3) such an option should not impede constitutional rights, 
        but expand and protect them during times when meeting together 
        may be difficult and inefficient.

                determination is received, except that such 20-day 
                period may be extended for good cause. As soon as 
                practicable after the individual requests review of the 
                determination, the Commissioner shall provide notice to 
                the individual of a final determination of eligibility 
                for benefits under this section.
            (2) Benefit payment determinations.--
                    (A) In general.--The Commissioner shall make any 
                monthly benefit payment to an individual claiming 
                benefits for a month under this section, or provide 
                notice of the reason such payment will not be made if 
                the Commissioner determines that the individual is not 
                entitled to payment for such month, not later than 20 
                days after the individual's monthly benefit claim 
                report for such month is received. Such monthly report 
                shall be filed with the Commissioner not later than 15 
                days after the end of each month.
                    (B) Review.--If the Commissioner determines that 
                payment will not be made to an individual for a month, 
                or if the Commissioner determines that payment shall be 
                made based on a number of caregiving days in the month 
                inconsistent with the number of caregiving days in the 
                monthly benefit claim report of the individual for such 
                month, the individual may request review of such 
                determination at any time before the end of the 20-day 
                period that begins on the date notice of such 
                determination is received, except that such 20-day 
                period may be extended for good cause. Not later than 
                20 days after the individual requests review of the 
                determination, the Commissioner shall provide notice to 
                the individual of a final determination of payment for 
                such month, and shall make payment to the individual of 
                any additional amount not included in the initial 
                payment to the individual for such month to which the 
                Commissioner determines the individual is entitled.
            (3) Burden of proof.--An application for benefits under 
        this section and a monthly benefit claim report of an 
        individual shall each be presumed to be true and accurate, 
        unless the Commissioner demonstrates by a preponderance of the 
        evidence that information contained in the application is 
        false.
            (4) Definition of monthly benefit claim report.--For 
        purposes of this subsection, the term ``monthly benefit claim 
        report'' means, with respect to an individual for a month, the 
        individual's report to the Commissioner of the number of 
        caregiving days of the individual in such month, which shall be 
        filed no later than 15 days after the end of each month.
            (5) Review.--All final determinations of the Commissioner 
        under this subsection shall be reviewable according to the 
        procedures set out in section 205 of the Social Security Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 405).
    (g) Relationship With State Law; Employer Benefits.--
            (1) In general.--This section does not preempt or supercede 
        any provision of State or local law that authorizes a State or 
        local municipality to provide paid family and medical leave 
        benefits similar to the benefits provided under this section.
            (2) Greater benefits allowed.--Nothing in this title shall 
        be construed to diminish the obligation of an employer to 
        comply with any contract, collective bargaining agreement, or 
        any employment benefit program or plan that provides greater 
        paid leave or other leave rights to employees than the rights 
        established under this title.
    (h) Prohibited Acts; Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person to 
        discharge or in any other manner discriminate against an 
        individual because the individual has applied for, indicated an 
        intent to apply for, or received family and medical leave 
        insurance benefits.
            (2) Civil action by an individual.--
                    (A) Liability.--Any person who violates paragraph 
                (1) shall be liable to any individual employed by such 
                person who is affected by the violation--

                                        compensation denied or lost to 
                                        such individual by reason of 
                                        the violation; or
                                            (bb) in a case in which

                                        monetary losses sustained by 
                                        the individual as a direct 
                                        result of the violation, such 
                                        as the cost of providing care, 
                                        up to a sum equal to 60 
                                        calendar days of wages or 
                                        salary for the individual;
                                    (II) the interest on the amount

                                    (III) an additional amount as 
                                liquidated damages equal to the sum of 
                                the amount described in subclause (I) 
                                and the interest described in subclause 
                                (II), except that if a person who has 
                                violated paragraph (1) proves to the 
                                satisfaction of the court that the act 
                                or omission which violated paragraph 
                                (1) was in good faith and that the 
                                person had reasonable grounds for 
                                believing that the act or omission was 
                                not a violation of paragraph (1), such 
                                court may, in the discretion of the 
                                court, reduce the amount of the 
                                liability to the amount and interest 
                                determined under subclauses (I) and 
                                (II), respectively; and
                            (ii) for such equitable relief as may be

                        reckless or intentional disregard of rules and 
                        regulations (but not due to fraud).
            ``(2) Taxpayers making improper prior claims.--In the case 
        of a taxpayer who is denied credit under this section for any 
        taxable year as a result of the deficiency procedures under 
        subchapter B of chapter 63, no credit shall be allowed under 
        this section for any subsequent taxable year unless the 
        taxpayer provides such information as the Secretary may require 
        to demonstrate eligibility for such credit.
    ``(j) Reconciliation of Credit and Advance Credit.--
            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the credit allowed under 
        this section to any taxpayer for any taxable year shall be 
        reduced (but not below zero) by the aggregate amount of 
        payments made under section 7527A to such taxpayer during such 
        taxable year.
            ``(2) Excess advance payments.--If the aggregate amount of 
        payments under section 7527A to the taxpayer during the taxable 
        year exceeds the amount of the credit allowed under this 
        section to such taxpayer for such taxable year (determined 
        without regard to paragraph (1)), the tax imposed by this 
        chapter for such taxable year shall be increased by the amount 
        of such excess.''.
    (c) Advance Payment of Credit.--Section 7527A of such Code is 
amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 7527A. ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CHILD TAX CREDIT.

    ``(a) In General.--As soon as practicable after the date of the 
enactment of this section, the Secretary shall establish a program for

        section 36C(a) (determined without regard to subsection (j) 
        thereof) for the taxpayer's taxable year beginning in such 
        calendar year if--

                taxable year,

        the case of taxpayer who did not file a return of tax for such 
        taxable year, the taxpayer's taxable year beginning in the 
        second preceding calendar year.
            ``(3) Modifications during calendar year.--The Secretary 
        may modify, during any calendar year, the annual advance amount 
        with respect to any taxpayer for such calendar year to take 
        into account--
                    ``(A) a return of tax filed by such taxpayer during

                reference taxable year), and

                taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the Secretary to

                aggregate during any taxable year of the taxpayer, more 
                closely total the Secretary's best estimate of the 
                credit allowed to the taxpayer under section 36C(a) 
                (determined without regard to subsection (i) thereof) 
                for such taxable year.
    ``(c) On-Line Information Portal.--The Secretary shall establish an 
on-line portal which allows taxpayers to--

            ``(2) provide information to the Secretary which would be 
        relevant to a modification under subsection (b)(3)(B) of the

calendar year following any calendar year during which the Secretary 
makes one or more payments to any taxpayer under this section, the 
Secretary shall provide such taxpayer with a written notice which 
includes the taxpayer's taxpayer identity (as defined in section 
6103(b)(6)), the aggregate amount of such payments made to such 
taxpayer during such calendar year, and such other information as the 
Secretary determines appropriate.
    ``(e) Authority To Adjust Interval of Payments.--If the Secretary 
determines that it is not administratively feasible to make monthly

system amounts equal to the loss to that possession by reason of the 
application of section 36C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as 
added by section 4001) with respect to taxable years beginning after 
2020. Such amounts shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury

possession.
    (b) Other Possessions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to 
each possession of the United States which does not have a mirror code 
tax system amounts estimated by the Secretary of the Treasury as being 
equal to the aggregate benefits that would have been provided to 
residents of such possession by reason of the application of section 
36C of such Code (as so added) for taxable years beginning after 2021 
if a mirror code tax system had been in effect in such possession. The 
preceding sentence shall not apply with respect to any possession of 
the United States unless such possession has a plan, which has been 
approved by the Secretary of the Treasury, under which such possession 
will promptly distribute such payments to the residents of such 
possession.

Taxes.--No credit shall be allowed against United States income taxes

        the term ``mirror code tax system'' means, with respect to any 
        possession of the United States, the income tax system of such 
        possession if the income tax liability of the residents of such 
        possession under such system is determined by reference to the 
        income tax laws of the United States as if such possession were 
        the United States.

        1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, the payments under

                                covered by the grant is completed; and

                        amounts of any grants received by such 
                        applicant under this section will be treated as

                        accordance with paragraph (3) and the 
                        regulations thereunder; and

                repayment requirements that are the consequence of the 
                failure to complete the service obligation.

        serves as a full or part-time educator in a licensed early 
        childhood education program concurrently while enrolled in a

        service toward the fulfillment of the service obligation in the 
        agreement under paragraph (1).
            (3) Repayment for failure to complete service.--Except as 
        provided in paragraph (4), in the event that any recipient of a 
        grant under this section fails or refuses to comply with the 
        service obligation in the agreement under paragraph (1), the 
        sum of the amounts of any grants received by such recipient 
        shall, upon a determination of such a failure or refusal in 
        such service obligation, be treated as a Federal Direct 
        Unsubsidized Stafford Loan under part D of title IV of the 
        Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) except 
        that--
                    (A) no interest shall accrue on such amounts; and
                    (B) such amounts shall be subject to repayment in 
                accordance with--
                            (i) an income-contingent or income-based 
                        repayment plan, if the individual meets the 
                        eligibility requirements for such a repayment 
                        plan; and
                            (ii) such other terms and conditions as are 
                        specified by the Secretary in regulations 
                        promulgated under this section.
            (4) Hardship extension.--In the case of a recipient who has 
        made a good faith effort to find employment in a licensed early 
        learning program and has been unable to acquire such 
        employment, the Secretary is authorized to provide a hardship 
        extension for a period of not more than one year to grant 
        recipients who fail to complete their service requirement 
        within a 2-year period.
    (d) Grant Amount.--An eligible individual selected to receive a 
grant or a grant renewal under this section shall receive a grant in an 
amount not to exceed $3,000 for each academic year during which the 
individual is enrolled on a full-time or part-time basis in the 
qualified early childhood educator program for which the grant was 
awarded.
    (e) Grant Disbursement.--Payments under this section shall be made 
in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary for such 
purpose and in such manner as will best accomplish the purposes of this 
section, provided--
            (1) any disbursement made by crediting a grant recipient's 
        account shall be limited to tuition and fees and other 
        materials necessary for the completion of coursework as 
        determined by the Secretary; and
            (2) not less than 85 percent of any funds provided to an 
        eligible institution under subsection (a) shall be advanced to 
        the eligible institution prior to the start of each payment 
        period and shall be based upon an amount requested by the 
        institution as needed to cover the total cost of grants awarded 
        to eligible recipients until such time as the Secretary 
        determines and publishes in the Federal Register with an 
        opportunity for comment, an alternative payment system that 
        provides payments to institutions in an accurate and timely 
        manner, except that this sentence shall not be construed to 
        limit the authority of the Secretary to place an institution on 
        a reimbursement system of payment.
    (f) Direct Payment.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
prohibit the Secretary from making a grant directly to an eligible 
individual in a case in which an institution of higher education with a

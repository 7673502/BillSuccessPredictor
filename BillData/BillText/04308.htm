    For the purposes of this Act--
            (1) the term ``interactive wagering platform'' means a 
        person or entity to the extent such person or entity offers 
        lawful wagering over the internet, including through an 
        internet website or mobile application; and
            (2) the term ``wager'' means the staking or risking by any 
        person of something of value upon the outcome of an event, 
        including the outcome of any portion or aspect thereof, upon an

        shall receive something of value in the event of a certain 
        outcome.

SEC. 3. IGRA MOBILE WAGERS.

    For purposes of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et

        the same State; and
            (2) the applicable State and Indian Tribe have entered into 
        a Tribal-State compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.

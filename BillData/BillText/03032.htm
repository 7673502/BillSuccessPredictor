To increase funding for the 10-Year Pediatric Research Initiative Fund 
 by eliminating taxpayer financing of presidential election campaigns.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Jonny Wade Pediatric Cancer Research 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings Relating to Pediatric Cancer.--Congress finds that 
pediatric cancer--
            (1) kills over 100,000 children annually worldwide;
            (2) reduces a child's life expectancy by 69 years once 
        diagnosed;
            (3) increases the likelihood of a secondary cancer;
            (4) is the leading cause of death by disease in children;
            (5) affects over 300,000 children annually worldwide; and
            (6) gives life-long adverse side effects to the patient.
    (b) Findings Relating to Pediatric Cancer Research.--Congress finds 
that pediatric cancer research--
            (1) increases new treatments for safety and effectiveness;
            (2) increases the likelihood of identifying a secondary 
        cancer after treatment;
            (3) increases survival rates for children;
            (4) increases the identity factors that may be associated 
        with reducing risk;
            (5) enhances our understanding of the fundamental 
        mechanisms of cancer;
            (6) increases survivorship research to reduce the long-term 
        adverse effects of cancer and its treatment; and
            (7) increases the ability to identify the likely causes of 
        pediatric cancer.

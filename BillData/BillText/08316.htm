United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing America's Borders Against 
Fentanyl Act''.

SEC. 2. REPORTS, EVALUATIONS, AND RESEARCH REGARDING DRUG INTERDICTION 
              AT AND BETWEEN PORTS OF ENTRY.

    (a) Research on Additional Technologies To Detect Fentanyl.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
        in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, the Federal Drug Administration, and the Defense 
        Advanced Research Projects Agency, shall research additional 
        technological solutions to--
                    (A) target and detect illicit fentanyl and its 
                precursors, including low-purity fentanyl, especially 
                in counterfeit pressed tablets, and illicit pill press 
                molds;
                    (B) enhance targeting of counterfeit pills through 
                nonintrusive, noninvasive, and other visual screening 
                technologies; and
                    (C) enhance data-driven targeting to increase 
                seizure rates of fentanyl and its precursors.
            (2) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized 
        to be appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Security to 
        carry out this subsection $20,000,000 for each of fiscal years 
        2023 through 2027.
    (b) Evaluation of Current Technologies and Strategies in Illicit 
Drug Interdiction and Procurement Decisions.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
        consultation with the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
        Administration, the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention, and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall 
        establish a program to collect available data and develop 
        metrics to measure how technologies and strategies used by the 
        Department, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and other 
        relevant Federal agencies have helped detect, deter, or address 
        illicit fentanyl and its precursors being trafficking into the 
        United States at and between land, air, and sea ports of entry. 
        Such data and metrics program may consider the rate of 
        detection at random secondary inspections at such ports of 
        entry, investigations and intelligence sharing into the origins 
        of illicit fentanyl later detected within the United States, 
        and other data or metrics considered appropriate by the 
        Secretary. The Secretary, as appropriate and in the 
        coordination with the officials specified in this paragraph, 
        may update such data and metrics program.
            (2) Reports.--
                    (A) Secretary of homeland security.--Not later than 
                one year after the date of the enactment of this Act 
                and biennially thereafter, the Secretary of Homeland 
                Security, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement 
                Administration, the Director of the Federal Bureau of

                data collected and metrics developed pursuant to the 
                program established under paragraph (1), submit to the 
                Committee on Homeland Security of the House of

                and Governmental Affairs a report that--
                            (i) examines and analyzes current 
                        technologies deployed at land, air, and sea 
                        ports of entry, including pilot technologies, 
                        to assess how well such technologies detect,

        Counternarcotics Strategies) to effectively evaluate region-
        specific goals, to the extent the performance measurement 
        system does not adequately measure the effectiveness of the 
        strategies, as determined by the Director, such strategies may 
        evaluate interdiction efforts at and between ports of entry, 
        interdiction technology, intelligence sharing, diplomacy, and 
        other appropriate metrics, specific to each supplemental 
        strategies region, as determined by the Director.''.

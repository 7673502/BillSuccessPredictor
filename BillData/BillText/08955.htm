        committees--
                    (A) has recognized the independence of, or has 
                established diplomatic relations with, any region 
                located in the territory of Ukraine that is occupied by

                backed separatists, including Crimea and the Donetsk 
                and Luhansk regions; or

        prohibition on assistance required by paragraph (1) with 
        respect to any such central government if the Secretary

        committees that to do so is in the national interest of the 
        United States, and includes a justification for such interest.
    (c) Duration.--The requirements and limitations of this section 
shall cease to be in effect if the Secretary of State determines and

under the control of Russian-backed separatists, including Crimea and 
the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

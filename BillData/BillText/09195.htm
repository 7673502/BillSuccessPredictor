                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 28, United States Code, to require the Attorney General 
  to submit an annual report to Congress on gang activity, reporting, 
        investigation, and prosecution, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gang Activity Reporting Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States is experiencing an unprecedented 
        surge in violent crime, including an increase of more than 30 
        percent in the rate of murders since 2020.
            (2) The most recent Department of Justice data regarding 
        gangs and criminal activity, published in the 2011 National 
        Gang Threat Assessment, indicated that gangs were responsible 
        for an average of 48 percent of violent crime in the United 
        States.
            (3) Up-to-date, accurate, and consistent reporting from the 
        relevant Federal agencies relating to gang activity in the 
        United States is a foundational element in enabling 
        policymakers to enact effective, evidence-based policy that 
        protects the people of the United States from gang activity.

amended by adding at the end the following:

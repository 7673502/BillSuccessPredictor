  To direct the Secretary of the Navy to establish a pilot program to 
   offer plant-based protein options at forward operating bases for 
                  consumption by members of the Navy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alternative Protein Pilot Act''.

SEC. 2. PLANT-BASED PROTEIN PILOT PROGRAM OF THE NAVY.

    (a) Establishment.--Not later than March 1, 2022, the Secretary of 
the Navy shall establish a pilot program to offer plant-based protein 
options at forward operating bases for consumption by members of the 
Navy.
    (b) Locations.--Not later than March 1, 2022, the Secretary shall 
select not fewer than two naval facilities to participate in the pilot 
program and shall prioritize facilities (such as Joint Region Marianas, 
Guam, Navy Support Facility, Diego Garcia, and U.S. Fleet Activities 
Sasebo, Japan) where livestock-based protein options may be costly to 
obtain or store.
    (c) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed 
to prevent offering livestock-based protein options alongside plant-
based protein options at naval facilities selected under subsection 
(b).
    (d) Termination.--The pilot program established under this section 
shall terminate three years after the date on which the Secretary 
establishes such pilot program.
    (e) Report.--Not later than one year after the termination of the 
pilot program, the Secretary shall submit, to the Committees on Armed 
Services of the Senate and House of Representatives, a report on the 
pilot program. Such report shall include the following elements:
            (1) The consumption rate of plant-based protein options by 
        members of the Navy under the pilot program.
            (2) A comparison of the costs of obtaining and storing, at 
        selected naval facilities--
                    (A) plant-based protein options; and
                    (B) storing livestock-based protein options.
            (3) Effective criteria to increase plant-based protein 
        options at naval facilities other than those selected under 
        subsection (b).
    (f) Plant-Based Protein Options Defined.--In this Act, the term 
``plant-based protein options'' means edible proteins made from plants 
(such as vegetables, beans, and legumes), fungi, or other non-animal 
sources.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

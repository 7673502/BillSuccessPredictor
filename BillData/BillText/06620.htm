                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 51, United States Code, to extend the authority of the 
 National Aeronautics and Space Administration to enter into leases of 
               non-excess property of the Administration.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``NASA Enhanced-Use Leasing Extension 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing to enter into agreements 
        with private sector entities, State and local governments, 
        academic institutions, and other Federal agencies for lease of 
        non-excess, underutilized NASA properties and facilities.
            (2) NASA uses enhanced-use leasing authority to support 
        responsible management of its real property, including to 
        improve the use of underutilized property for activities that 
        are compatible with NASA's mission and to reduce facility 
        operating and maintenance costs.
            (3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced-use lease 
        authority, NASA leased 65 real properties.
            (4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA's use of enhanced-use leasing 
        resulted in the collection of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue.
            (5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion of its 
        enhanced-use leasing revenues for repairs of facility control 
        systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air 
        conditioning.
            (6) NASA's use of enhanced-use leasing authority can 
        contribute to reducing the rate of increase of the Agency's 
        overall deferred maintenance cost.

SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO LEASES OF NON-EXCESS 
              PROPERTY OF THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE 
              ADMINISTRATION.

    Section 20145(g) of title 51, United States Code, is amended by 
striking ``December 31, 2021'' and inserting ``December 31, 2022''.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.

    The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of complying 
with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by 
reference to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO 
Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the Congressional 
Record by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

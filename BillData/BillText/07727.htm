``SEC. 498C. ASSISTANCE TO PROGRESS PERIOD INSTITUTIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall provide grants and technical 
assistance to covered progress period institutions in accordance with 
this section.
    ``(b) Authorized Activities.--Grants and assistance provided under 
this section shall be used to improve student achievement (as described 
in section 496(a)(5)(A)) at covered progress period institutions.
    ``(c) Duration.--Grants and assistance may be provided under this 
section for a period of not less than one year and not more than three 
years.
    ``(d) Conditions.--
            ``(1) Benchmarks.--
                    ``(A) In general.--To continue to receive support 
                under this section after the first year in which such 
                support is provided, an institution must show progress, 
                as determined by the Secretary, toward meeting the 
                standards for student achievement established by the 
                relevant accrediting agency or association pursuant to 
                section 496(a)(5)(A).
                    ``(B) Considerations.--In determining the progress 
                of an institution under subparagraph (A), the Secretary 
                may take into consideration extenuating circumstances 
                that may have contributed to the poor performance of 
                the institution in the first year of the review period.
            ``(2) Deadline for compliance.--An institution that does 
        not achieve an adjusted cohort default rate of less than 10 
        percent after receiving support under this section for three 
        consecutive years shall be ineligible to receive further 
        support under this section.
            ``(3) Prohibition.--An institution shall be ineligible to 
        receive further support under this section if, while the 
        institution was receiving such support, the total enrollment of 
        low-income students (as such term is defined in section 
        419N(b)(7)) at the institution decreased by 10 percent or more.
    ``(e) Covered Progress Period Institution.--In this section, the 
term `covered progress period institution' means--
            ``(1) a public institution of higher education that is 
        determined to be in progress period status;
            ``(2) a part B institution (as defined in section 322) that 
        is determined to be in progress period status; or
            ``(3) a private, nonprofit institution of higher 
        education--
                    ``(A) that is determined to be in progress period 
                status; and
                    ``(B) at which not less than 45 percent of the 
                total student enrollment consists of low-income 
                students (as such term is defined in section 
                419N(b)(7)).
    ``(f) Funding.--
            ``(1) In general.--There are appropriated such funds as the 
        Secretary, using the formula described in paragraph (2), 
        determines necessary to meet the needs of all eligible 
        institutions under this subsection.
            ``(2) Formula.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
        enactment of this section, the Secretary shall establish 
        through negotiated rulemaking a formula to determine the--
                    ``(A) proportional amount of institutional need 
                under this section; and
                    ``(B) total amount of institutional need under this 
                section.
            ``(3) Special rule.--Such formula must at minimum take into 
        consideration the severity of the problem, size of the 
        institution, institutional resources, historical underfunding, 
        and the number of low-income students (as such term is defined 
        in section 419N(b)(7)) being served.''.

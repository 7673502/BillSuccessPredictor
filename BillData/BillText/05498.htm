(8 U.S.C. 1151(d)) shall be increased by the number computed under

        section 201(d) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.

        permanent residence under section 203(b) of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(b)) during the fiscal years

issued and used as the basis for an application for admission into the 
United States.

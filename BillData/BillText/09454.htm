SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The future strength of the Nation's democracy, as well 
        as the Nation's economy, is dependent upon the investments made 
        in children and youth today.
            (2) Evidence demonstrates that effective partnerships among 
        schools and communities increase student achievement by 
        addressing the academic needs of students as well as the 
        challenges the students face outside the classroom. For 
        example:
                    (A) Chicago public schools lead one of the Nation's 
                largest community school initiatives and found that 
                students in grades 9 through 12 who attend a community 
                school have 61 percent fewer school-day absences than 
                their non-community school counterparts. When compared 
                to non-community school counterparts--
                            (i) students in grades 9 through 12 were 
                        found to have more positive educational 
                        experiences;
                            (ii) students in grades 4 through 8 had 
                        higher emotional health scores on the survey; 
                        and
                            (iii) students in kindergarten through 
                        grade 3 had 53 percent fewer suspensions and 55 
                        percent fewer misconducts.
                    (B) In a 7-year study of 200 Chicago public 
                schools, sociologist Anthony Bryk found that in schools 
                where grassroots organizations forge strong connections 
                with their schools, trust levels and parent involvement 
                are greater.
                    (C) United Way of Salt Lake's Promise Partnership, 
                an initiative across multiple school districts in the 
                Salt Lake, Utah area, has helped increase student 
                achievement and graduation rates. Since the program's 
                launch in 2014, 5 out of the 8 targeted indicators have 
                improved, even in light of the challenges posed by 
                COVID-19. Kindergarten readiness in numeracy increased 
                by 3 percent, 8th grade math proficiency improved by 8 
                percent, high school graduation rose by 5 percent, 
                postsecondary readiness grew by 4 percent, and 
                postsecondary completion increased by 5 percent. To 
                overcome pandemic-related learning loss in literacy, 
                Promise Partnership school Mill Creek Elementary 
                collaborated with 80 volunteers from organizations 
                including Goldman Sachs and Dominion Energy to offer 
                tutoring support through the iReady program. By the end 
                of the 2020-2021 school year, the number of 3rd grade 
                students participating in the program testing at or 
                above grade level tripled.
                    (D) From 2015 to 2018, the New York City Community 
                School Initiative improved attendance, on-time grade 
                progression, and graduation rates across elementary and 
                secondary students. During the same 3-year period, this 
                initiative led to a reduction in disciplinary incidents 
                for elementary and middle school students while also 
                improving math achievement scores. Middle school 
                students attending community schools scored 4.2 
                percentage points higher on math exams compared their 
                peers at non-community schools, and high school 
                students attending community schools earned 12 percent 
                more credits per academic year than students enrolled 
                at non-community schools.
                    (E) In Wisconsin, where formal partnerships with 
                community agencies are required for grant programs, 
                non-traditional partners have proven to be instrumental 
                for smaller communities to enrich after school 
                programs. Those partners have included--
                            (i) local trucking companies;
                            (ii) statewide nonprofit organizations, 
                        such as The Grange;
                            (iii) Farm Bureau;
                            (iv) small retailers; and
                            (v) retirees.
                    (F) The Union City Public Schools school district 
                in New Jersey proves that by breaking down 
                institutional ``silos'' and creating deep partnerships, 
                through collaboration and municipal involvement, 
                schools can be vibrant places of hope despite poverty, 
                unemployment, and lack of affordable housing.
                    (G) Six family resource centers housed in community 
                schools in Redwood City, California promote school 
                readiness among children while also providing parents 
                with educational services, community resources, and 
                leadership opportunities. A 2017 report indicates that 
                with the assistance of English language proficiency 
                supports, 70 percent of Redwood City community school 
                parents were able to participate in their children's 
                school meetings, attend professional development 
                programs, and engage in family-to-family education and 
                outreach. Over the course of a 3-year period, students 
                whose parents participated in family engagement 
                programs had a 40 percent increase in attendance and 
                were more likely to see improvement in their math and 
                English language test scores.
                    (H) By meeting the comprehensive needs of students, 
                Communities In Schools, a national dropout prevention 
                organization, found that 99 percent of participating 
                students stayed in school, 78 percent of participating 
                students met or made progress toward their attendance 
                goals, 90 percent met or made progress toward their 
                behavior goals, and 88 percent met or made progress 
                toward their academic improvement goals.
            (3) In adopting the Every Student Succeeds Act (Public Law 
        114-95), Congress recognized community schools as a strategy to 
        significantly improve the coordination and integration, 
        accessibility, and effectiveness of services for children and 
        families, particularly for children attending high-poverty 
        schools, including high-poverty rural schools. Congress 
        recognized community schools as an effective use of funds for 
        school districts in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 
        (Public Law 117-2).
            (4) Approximately 86 percent of 9th graders graduate from 
        high school within 4 years. Of students who graduate from high 
        school, 63 percent enroll in a 2- or 4-year college in the fall 
        after completing high school. Only about half (64 percent) of 
        first-time, full-time college freshmen seeking a 4-year degree 
        receive a bachelor's degree within 6 years or less.
            (5) Over the past 4 decades, the United States has slipped 
        from being first in the world in high school and college 
        graduation rates to 21st and 14th, respectively, putting the 
        Nation at a growing competitive disadvantage with other 
        countries.
            (6) The 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress 
        Long-Term Trend Assessment results indicate that between 2020 
        and 2022, students experienced a 5-percent drop in reading 
        scores, the largest drop since 1990, and a 7-percent decrease, 
        the first ever drop, in math scores. Black student scores in 
        math fell by 13 percent as compared to a 5-percent decrease by 
        their White peers, thus expanding the achievement gap from 25 
        percentage points to 33 percent percentage points in just 2 
        years.
            (7) In a study conducted by Hanover Research, data showed 
        that quality partnerships between schools and their communities 
        can result in improved attendance, motivation, conduct, and 
        academic achievement. Community-level strategies like focusing 
        on parental involvement, community building, and cultural 
        competence were shown to contribute to decreases in the 
        achievement gap between lower- and upper-income students.
            (8) Research from the Government Accountability Office 
        found that students who change schools less frequently are more 
        likely to perform at grade level and less likely to repeat a 
        grade than their less stable peers.
            (9) In research studies in psychology, health, and 
        education by Teachers College, Columbia University, school 
        ``connectedness'' is identified as important to student 
        learning, achievement, and well-being. When students feel a 
        sense of connection with the larger world and community 
        institutions, they are more engaged in instructional activities 
        and express greater commitment to school.
            (10) It has been learned from successful experiences that 
        hundreds of thousands of arts, cultural, service, sports, 
        college, and other youth organizations, as well as civic and 
        faith-based groups, want to partner with schools and educators 
        to reinforce learning, but far too often, neither the school 
        nor the community know how to effectively connect with each 
        other.
            (11) In order for the United States to compete in a global 
        economy, the co-partnering efforts of government, social 
        services, business, arts, home, community-based organizations, 
        and philanthropy need to concentrate their efforts where they 
        are most needed: in our schools.
            (12) Research from Johns Hopkins University has shown that 
        access to summer learning opportunities leads to significant 
        student learning gains not experienced by students who cannot 
        access summer learning opportunities.
            (13) A 2011 study conducted by the RAND Corporation found 
        that students who attend summer learning programs, particularly 
        those featuring individualized instruction, parental 
        involvement, and small class sizes, experience clear benefits 
        in overcoming the achievement gap between low- and upper-income 
        students.
            (14) Research from the Community School Partnership found 
        that community schools see a return of $7.11 for every dollar 
        of investment in community schools coordinators.
            (15) A 2017 report from the Learning Policy Institute found 
        that teacher retention has a direct impact on student learning 
        and academic performance. Implementing strategies such as 
        teacher residency programs, high-quality mentoring, grow your 
        own models, principal training and State leadership academies 
        can lead to higher rates of educator retention and career 
        satisfaction. For example, California's Paraprofessional 
        Teacher Training Program has prepared more than 2,200 
        paraprofessionals to become fully certified teachers with 92 
        percent of graduates obtaining teaching positions in California 
        public schools.
            (16) According to the National Center for Education 
        Statistics, 44 percent of public schools reported having at 
        least 1 full-time or part-time vacant teaching position in the 
        spring of 2022. Of those schools with reported unfilled 
        teaching positions, 51 percent cited resignation as the leading 
        cause of vacancies.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

        education;
            (5) to leverage and integrate the human and financial 
        assets of local communities, schools, State governments, the 
        Federal Government, and the natural assets of communities--
                    (A) toward better results for children, youth, and 
                families; and
                    (B) for sustained civic capacity;
            (6) to develop school improvement strategies that 
        incorporate approaches that meet the comprehensive needs of 
        children and youth, such as full service community schools, 
        community-based, integrated student services, and related 
        approaches;
            (7) to ensure that schools and neighborhoods are safe and 
        provide a positive climate for learning; and
            (8) to address learning loss as a result of the COVID-19 
        pandemic.

    Section 411(c) of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921(c)) is 
amended by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:(3)(A) If 
x-ray, CT scan, biopsy, autopsy, or other medically accepted and 
relevant test or procedure establishes that a miner is suffering or has 
suffered from a chronic dust disease of the lung, diagnosed as 
complicated pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis (as 
determined in accordance with subparagraph (B)), then there shall be an 
irrebuttable presumption that such miner is totally disabled due to 
pneumoconiosis, that the miner's death was due to pneumoconiosis, or 
that at the time of death the miner was totally disabled by 
pneumoconiosis, as the case may be.
            ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), complicated 
        pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis can be 
        established by any of the following:
                    ``(i) A chest radiograph, which yields one or more 
                large opacities whose greatest diameter exceeds 1 
                centimeter and would be classified in Category A, B, or 
                C in the International Classification of Radiographs of 
                Pneumoconiosis by the International Labor Organization, 
                in the absence of more probative evidence sufficient to 
                establish that the etiology of the large opacity is not 
                pneumoconiosis.
                    ``(ii) A chest CT scan, which yields one or more 
                large opacities whose greatest diameter exceeds 1 
                centimeter, in the absence of more probative evidence 
                sufficient to establish that the etiology of the large 
                opacity is not pneumoconiosis.
                    ``(iii) A lung biopsy or autopsy, which would yield 
                a lesion at least 1 centimeter in its long axis 
                diameter if measured at the time of gross dissection.
                    ``(iv) A diagnosis by other means that would 
                reasonably be expected to yield results described in 
                clause (i), (ii), or (iii).''.

SEC. 103. DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE BY THE SECRETARY.

    Part C of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 931 et seq.) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 435. DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL EVIDENCE BY THE SECRETARY.

    ``(a) Complete Pulmonary Evaluation.--Upon request by a claimant 
for benefits under this title, the Secretary shall provide the claimant 
an opportunity to substantiate the claim through a complete pulmonary 
evaluation of the miner that shall include--
            ``(1) an initial report, conducted by a qualified physician 
        on the list provided under subsection (e), and in accordance 
        with subsection (d)(5) and sections 402(f)(1)(D) and 413(b); 
        and
            ``(2) if the conditions under subsection (b) are met, any 
        supplemental medical evidence described in subsection (c).
    ``(b) Authorizing Chest Scans.--In diagnosing whether there is 
complicated pneumoconiosis as a part of a medical examination conducted 
under subsection (a), the Secretary shall authorize a high-quality, 
low-dose or standard computerized tomography scan where any or a 
combination of the following is found:
            ``(1) Any certified B reader of a chest radiograph 
        associated with an exam conducted under section 413(b) finds 
        pneumoconiosis (ILO category 2/1 or greater).

        associated with an exam conducted under section 413(b) finds a 
        coalescence of small opacities.

shall develop supplemental medical evidence, in accordance with 
subsection (d)--
            ``(1) for any claim in which the Secretary recommends an 
        award of benefits based on the results of the initial report 
        under subsection (a)(1) and a party opposing such award submits 
        evidence that could be considered contrary to the findings of 
        the Secretary; and
            ``(2) for any compensation case under this title heard by 
        an administrative law judge, in which--
                    ``(A) the Secretary has awarded benefits to the 
                claimant;
                    ``(B) the party opposing such award has submitted 
                evidence not previously reviewed that could be

                represented by an attorney, the claimant's attorney

        physician who conducted the initial report under subsection 
        (a)(1) to--
                    ``(A) review any medical evidence submitted after 
                such report or the most recent supplemental report, as 
                appropriate; and
                    ``(B) update his or her opinion in a supplemental 
                report.
            ``(2) Alternative physician.--If such physician is no 
        longer available or is unwilling to provide supplemental 
        medical evidence under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
        select another qualified physician from the list provided 
        pursuant to subsection (e) to provide such evidence.
    ``(e) Qualified Physicians for Complete Pulmonary Evaluation and 
Protections for Suitability and Potential Conflicts of Interest.--
            ``(1) Qualified physicians list.--The Secretary shall 
        create and maintain a list of qualified physicians to be 
        selected by a claimant to perform the complete pulmonary 
        evaluation described in subsection (a).
            ``(2) Public availability.--The Secretary shall make the 
        list under this subsection available to the public.
            ``(3) Annual evaluation.--Each year, the Secretary shall 
        update such list by reviewing the suitability of the listed 
        qualified physicians and assessing any potential conflicts of 
        interest.
            ``(4) Criteria for suitability.--The Secretary shall 
        include on the list only those physicians whom the Secretary 
        determines are qualified, capable, and willing to provide 
        credible opinions consistent with the premises underlying this 
        Act. In determining whether a physician is suitable to be on 
        the list under this subsection, the Secretary shall consult the 
        National Practitioner Data Bank of the Department of Health and 
        Human Services and assess reports of adverse licensure, 
        certifications, hospital privilege, and professional society 
        actions involving the physician. In no case shall such list 
        include any physician--
                    ``(A) who is not licensed to practice medicine in 
                any State or any territory, commonwealth, or possession

                or possession of the United States.
            ``(5) Conflicts of interest.--The Secretary shall develop 
        and implement policies and procedures to ensure that any actual 
        or potential conflict of interest of qualified physicians on 
        the list under this subsection, including both individual and 
        organizational conflicts of interest, are disclosed to the 
        Department, and to provide such disclosure to claimants. Such 
        policies and procedures shall provide that a physician with a 
        conflict of interest shall not be used to perform a complete 
        pulmonary medical evaluation under subsection (a) that is 
        reimbursed pursuant to subsection (g) if--
                    ``(A) such physician is employed by, under contract 
                to, or otherwise providing services to a private party 
                opposing the claim, a law firm or lawyer representing 
                such opposing party, or an interested insurer or other 
                interested third party; or

                insurer or other interested third party in the previous 
                24 months.

report under this section, the Secretary shall enter the report in the 
record and provide a copy of such report to all parties to the 
proceeding.

evidence under this section shall be paid for by the fund. If a 
claimant receives a final award of benefits, the operator liable for 
payment of benefits, if any, shall reimburse the fund for such 
expenses, which shall include interest.''.

following:

``SEC. 436. READJUDICATING CASES INVOLVING DISCREDITED EXPERT OPINIONS.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Covered chest radiograph.--The term `covered chest 
        radiograph' means a chest radiograph that was interpreted as 
        negative for simple pneumoconiosis, complicated pneumoconiosis, 
        or progressive massive fibrosis by a physician with respect to 
        whom the Secretary has directed, in writing and after an 
        evaluation by the Secretary, that such physician's negative 
        interpretations of chest radiographs not be credited, except 
        where subsequently determined to be credible by the Secretary 
        in evaluating a claim for benefits under this Act.
            ``(2) Covered individual.--The term `covered individual' 
        means an individual whose record for a claim for benefits under 
        this Act includes a covered chest radiograph.
            ``(3) Covered survivor.--The term `covered survivor' means 
        an individual who--
                    ``(A) is a survivor of a covered individual whose 
                claim under this Act was still pending at the time of 
                the covered individual's death; and
                    ``(B) who continued to seek an award with respect 
                to the covered individual's claim after the covered 
                individual's death.
    ``(b) Claims.--A covered individual or a covered survivor whose 
claim for benefits under this Act was denied may file a new claim for 
benefits under this Act.
    ``(c) Adjudication on the Merits.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any new claim filed under subsection (b) 
        shall be adjudicated on the merits and shall not include 
        consideration of a covered chest radiograph.
            ``(2) Covered survivor.--Any new claim filed under 
        subsection (b) by a covered survivor shall be adjudicated as 
        either a miner's or a survivor's claim depending upon the type 
        of claim pending at the time of the covered individual's death.
    ``(d) Time of Payment.--
            ``(1) Miner's claim.--If a claim, filed under subsection 
        (b) and adjudicated under subsection (c) as a miner's claim, 
        results in an award of benefits, benefits shall be payable 
        beginning with the month of the filing of the denied claim that 
        had included in its record a covered chest radiograph.
            ``(2) Survivor's claim.--If a claim, filed under subsection 
        (b) and adjudicated under subsection (c) as a survivor's claim, 
        results in an award of benefits, benefits shall be payable 
        beginning with the month of the miner's death.
    ``(e) Contributing Impact.--The Secretary shall have the discretion 
to deny a new claim under subsection (b) in circumstances where the 
party opposing such claim establishes through clear and convincing 
evidence that a covered chest radiograph did not contribute to the 
decision to deny benefits in all prior claims filed by the covered 
individual or the covered survivor.
    ``(f) Limitation on Filing of New Claims.--A new claim for benefits 
may be filed under subsection (b) only if the original claim was 
finally denied by a district director, an administrative law judge, or 
the Benefits Review Board established under section 21(b) of the 
Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 921(b)).''.

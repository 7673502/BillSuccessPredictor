SECTION 1. NATIONAL DEFENSE STOCKPILE ASSESSMENT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than April 1, 2023, the Comptroller

Services of the House of Representatives a report assessing the efforts 
of the Secretary of Defense with respect to the National Defense 
Stockpile, including--

        under section 14 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock 
        Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98h-5);
            (2) the extent to which the Secretary has assessed whether 
        the reserves of strategic and critical materials that are 
        contained in the National Defense Stockpile reduce the 
        dependence of the United States on foreign sources or single 
        sources for supplies of such strategic and critical materials 
        in times of national emergency;
            (3) the risks identified by the Secretary of Defense 
        arising from insufficient reserves of certain strategic and 
        critical materials in the National Defense Stockpile; and
            (4) recommendations for improvements with respect to the 
        items described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).
    (b) Briefing.--Not later than April 30, 2023, the Comptroller 
General shall provide to the Committee On Armed Services of the House 
of Representatives a briefing on the findings and recommendations of 
the report required by subsection (a).
    (c) Definitions.--In this Act:
            (1) National emergency.--The term ``national emergency'' 
        has the meaning given such term in section 12 of the Strategic 
        and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98h-3).
            (2) Strategic and critical material.--The term ``strategic 
        and critical materials'' means a material determined to be 
        strategic and critical material by the President pursuant to 
        section 3(a) of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock 
        Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98b(a)).

        greater than the rate which the Secretary estimates will permit 
        the issuance of each such bond with a specified maturity or 
        redemption date without discount and without interest cost to 
        the issuer. The applicable interest rate with respect to any 
        such bond shall be determined as of the first day on which

                permitted under this paragraph for bonds issued during 
                the following calendar month. Such maximum term shall 
                be the term which the Secretary estimates will result 
                in the present value of the obligation to repay the 
                principal on the bond being equal to 20 percent of the 
                face amount of such bond. Such present value shall be 
                determined using as a discount rate the average annual 
                interest rate of tax-exempt obligations having a term 
                of 10 years or more which are issued during the month. 
                If the term as so determined is not a multiple of a 
                whole year, such term shall be rounded to the next 
                highest whole year.

        with proceeds of SIFIA bonds are owned by a person otherwise 
        entitled to allowance for depreciation with respect to such 
        facility, that person may make an irrevocable election (binding 
        on any successors in interest) not to claim depreciation with 
        respect to the property financed with proceeds of the SIFIA 
        bonds for so long as the issue of which such bonds are a part 
        is outstanding. Such election shall be deemed to have been made 
        if the person fails to claim depreciation with respect to the 
        property in the first tax return filed by the person in which 
        such depreciation could have been claimed. To the extent the 
        person elects not to claim depreciation under this paragraph, 
        the basis of the financed property shall not be reduced under 
        section 1016 or otherwise for the depreciation that could have 
        been claimed.

        made in writing before the first interest payment date with 
        respect to the bond in such form and manner as the Secretary 
        shall prescribe. Such election, once made, shall be 
        irrevocable.

        with respect to which an election is made under this 
        subsection, the following rules shall apply:

                in gross income for purposes of this title.
                    ``(B) Any payments made under this subsection shall 
                not be includible as income for purposes of this title.

                SIFIA bond for which credit payments have been elected 
                under this subsection shall be reduced by the amount of 
                such credit payments.''.

subchapter A of chapter 1 is amended by adding at the end the

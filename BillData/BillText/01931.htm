        to educate individuals, including through the use of digital 
        resources, in the United States on the historical importance of 
        Japanese American confinement during World War II, so that 
        present and future generations may learn from Japanese American 
        confinement and the commitment of the United States to equal 
        justice under the law.
            ``(5) Japanese american organization.--The term `Japanese 
        American organization' means a private nonprofit organization 
        within the United States established to promote the 
        understanding and appreciation of the ethnic and cultural 
        diversity of the United States by illustrating the Japanese 
        American experience throughout the history of the United 
        States.''; and
            (2) in section 4--

        section, not more than $10,000,000 shall be awarded as Japanese 
        American Confinement Education Grants to Japanese American

        not less than $750,000 and the Secretary shall give priority 
        consideration to Japanese American organizations with fewer 
        than 100 employees.

                    ``(A) Fifty percent.--Except as provided in 
                subparagraph (B), for funds awarded under this

                which may include cash or durable goods and materials 
                fairly valued, as determined by the Secretary.
                    ``(B) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive all or part 
                of the matching requirement under subparagraph (A), if

                        matching requirement; and
                            ``(ii) the probable benefit of the project 
                        funded outweighs the public interest in such 
                        matching requirement.''.

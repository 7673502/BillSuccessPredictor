                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the tenth general capital increase for the Inter-American 
               Development Bank, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Inter-American Development Bank 
General Capital Increase Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. ADDRESSING CHINA'S SOVEREIGN LENDING PRACTICES IN LATIN AMERICA 
              AND THE CARIBBEAN.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) since 2005, the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China has expanded sovereign lending to governments in Latin 
        America and the Caribbean with loans that are repaid or 
        collateralized with natural resources or commodities;
            (2) several countries in Latin American and the Caribbean 
        that have received a significant amount of sovereign lending 
        from the Government of the People's Republic of China face 
        challenges in repaying such loans;
            (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China's 
        predatory economic practices and sovereign lending practices in 
        Latin America and the Caribbean negatively influence United 
        States national interests in the Western Hemisphere;
            (4) the Inter-American Development Bank, the premier 
        multilateral development bank dedicated to the Western 
        Hemisphere, should play a significant role supporting the 
        countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in achieving 
        sustainable and serviceable debt structures; and
            (5) a tenth general capital increase for the Inter-American 
        Development Bank would strengthen the Bank's ability to help 
        the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean achieve 
        sustainable and serviceable debt structures.
    (b) Support for a General Capital Increase.--The President shall 
take steps to support a tenth general capital increase for the Inter-
American Development Bank, including advancing diplomatic engagement to 
build support among member countries of the Bank for a tenth general 
capital increase for the Bank.
    (c) Tenth Capital Increase.--The Inter-American Development Bank 
Act (22 U.S.C. 283 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

    ``(a) Vote Authorized.--The United States Governor of the Bank is

    ``(c) Limitations on Authorization of Appropriations.--
            ``(1) In general.--In order to pay for the increase in the

                the Bank; and
                    ``(B) $23,414,485,761 shall be for callable shares

        restructure debt resulting from sovereign lending by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China in order to 
        achieve sustainable and serviceable debt structures; and
            (2) to establish appropriate safeguards and transparency 
        and conditionality measures to protect debt-vulnerable member 
        countries of the Inter-American Development Bank that borrow 
        from the Bank for the purposes of restructuring Chinese 
        bilateral debt held by such countries and preventing such 
        countries from incurring subsequent Chinese bilateral debt.

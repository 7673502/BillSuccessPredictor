 To require the Transportation Security Administration to issue a plan 
 to improve security screening procedures at airports during the COVID-

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Security Screening During COVID-19 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PLAN.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in coordination with the 
Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Homeland Security, and in 
consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the 
Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall issue 
and commence implementing a plan to enhance, as appropriate, security 
operations at airports during the COVID-19 national emergency in order 
to reduce risk of the spread of the coronavirus at passenger screening 
checkpoints and among the TSA workforce.
    (b) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall include 
the following:
            (1) An identification of best practices developed in 
        response to the coronavirus among foreign governments, 
        airports, and air carriers conducting aviation security 
        screening operations, as well as among Federal agencies 
        conducting similar security screening operations outside of 
        airports, including in locations where the spread of the 
        coronavirus has been successfully contained, that could be 
        further integrated into the United States aviation security 
        system.
            (2) Specific operational changes to aviation security 
        screening operations informed by the identification of best 
        practices under paragraph (1) that could be implemented without 
        degrading aviation security and a corresponding timeline and 
        costs for implementing such changes.
    (c) Considerations.--In carrying out the identification of best 
practices under subsection (b), the Administrator shall take into 
consideration the following:
            (1) Aviation security screening procedures and practices in 
        place at security screening locations, including procedures and 
        practices implemented in response to the coronavirus.
            (2) Volume and average wait times at each such security 
        screening location.
            (3) Public health measures already in place at each such 
        security screening location.
            (4) The feasibility and effectiveness of implementing 
        similar procedures and practices in locations where such are 
        not already in place.
            (5) The feasibility and potential benefits to security, 
        public health, and travel facilitation of continuing any 
        procedures and practices implemented in response to the COVID-
        19 national emergency beyond the end of such emergency.
    (d) Consultation.--In developing the plan required under subsection 
(a), the Administrator may consult with public and private stakeholders 
and the TSA workforce, including through the labor organization 
certified as the exclusive representative of full- and part-time non-
supervisory TSA personnel carrying out screening functions under 
section 44901 of title 49, U.S. Code.
    (e) Submission.--Upon issuance of the plan required under 
subsection (a), the Administrator shall submit the plan to the 
Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate.
    (f) Issuance and Implementation.--The Administrator shall not be 
required to issue or implement, as the case may be, the plan required 
under subsection (a) upon the termination of the COVID-19 national 
emergency except to the extent the Administrator determines such 
issuance or implementation, as the case may be, to be feasible and 
beneficial to security screening operations.
    (g) GAO Review.--Not later than 1 year after the issuance of the 
plan required under subsection (a) (if such plan is issued in 
accordance with subsection (f)), the Comptroller General of the United 
States shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the House 
of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate a review, if appropriate, of such plan and 
any efforts to implement such plan.

        Administrator of the Transportation Security Administration.

                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit commercial sexual orientation conversion therapy, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender 
        nonconforming is not a disorder, disease, illness, deficiency, 
        or shortcoming.
            (2) The national community of professionals in education, 
        social work, health, mental health, and counseling has 
        determined that there is no scientifically valid evidence that 
        supports the practice of attempting to prevent a person from 
        being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender 
        nonconforming.
            (3) Such professionals have determined that there is no 
        evidence that conversion therapy is effective or that an 
        individual's sexual orientation or gender identity can be 
        changed by conversion therapy.
            (4) Such professionals have also determined that the 
        potential risks of conversion therapy are not only that it is 
        ineffective, but also that it is substantially dangerous to an 
        individual's mental and physical health, and has been shown to 
        contribute to depression, self-harm, low self-esteem, family 
        rejection, and suicide.
            (5) It is in the interest of the Nation to prevent lesbian, 
        gay, bisexual, transgender, and gender nonconforming people and 
        their families from being defrauded by persons seeking to 
        profit by offering this harmful and wholly ineffective therapy.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Conversion therapy.--The term ``conversion therapy''--
                    (A) means any practice or treatment by any person 
                that seeks to change another individual's sexual 
                orientation or gender identity, including efforts to 
                change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate 
                or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings 
                toward individuals of the same gender, if such person--
                            (i) receives monetary compensation in 
                        exchange for such practice or treatment; or
                            (ii) instead of, or in addition to, 
                        receiving monetary compensation in exchange for 
                        such practice or treatment directly, receives 
                        monetary compensation in exchange for a product 
                        or service that is integral to the provision of 
                        such practice or treatment by such person, 
                        unless such product or service is protected by 
                        the First Amendment to the Constitution; and
                    (B) does not include any practice or treatment, 
                which does not seek to change sexual orientation or 
                gender identity, that--
                            (i) provides assistance to an individual 
                        undergoing a gender transition; or
                            (ii) provides acceptance, support, and 
                        understanding of a client or facilitation of a 
                        client's coping, social support, and identity 
                        exploration and development, including sexual 
                        orientation-neutral interventions to prevent or 
                        address unlawful conduct or unsafe sexual 
                        practices.
            (2) Gender identity.--The term ``gender identity'' means 
        the gender-related identity, appearance, mannerisms, or other 
        gender-related characteristics of an individual, regardless of 
        the individual's designated sex at birth.
            (3) Person.--The term ``person'' means any individual, 
        partnership, corporation, cooperative, association, or any 
        other entity.
            (4) Sexual orientation.--The term ``sexual orientation'' 
        means homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality.

                    (A) to change another individual's sexual 
                orientation or gender identity;
                    (B) to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic 
                attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same 
                gender; or
                    (C) that such efforts are harmless or without risk 
                to individuals receiving such therapy; or
            (3) to knowingly assist or facilitate the provision of 
        conversion therapy to an individual if such person receives 
        compensation from any source in connection with providing 
        conversion therapy.
    (b) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Violation of rule.--A violation of subsection (a) shall 
        be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or

                means, and with the same jurisdiction, powers, and 
                duties as though all applicable terms and provisions of 
                the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) 
                were incorporated into and made a part of this Act.

                Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).
            (3) Regulations.--The Federal Trade Commission may 
        promulgate, in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United

        reason to believe that an interest of the residents of the 
        State has been or is being threatened or adversely affected by 
        a practice that violates subsection (a), the attorney general 
        of the State may, as parens patriae, bring a civil action on

        court of the United States to obtain appropriate relief.

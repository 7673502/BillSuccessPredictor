   To provide assistance for mature technology nodes, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Mature Technology Node Resiliency 
and Manufacturing Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. ASSISTANCE FOR MATURE TECHNOLOGY NODES.

            (1) In general.--There is appropriated $2,000,000,000 for 
        fiscal year 2022 to implement section 9902 of Public Law 116-
        283 to provide Federal financial assistance to covered entities 
        to incentivize investment in facilities and equipment in the 
        United States for the fabrication, assembly, testing, or 
        advanced packaging of semiconductors at mature technology 
        nodes.
            (2) Criteria for assistance.--In addition to the 
        procedures, eligibility, and considerations for review 
        specified in subsection (a)(2) of Public Law 116-283, in order 
        for an entity to qualify to receive Federal financial 
        assistance under this section, the covered entity shall--
                    (A)(i) provide equipment or materials for the 
                fabrication, assembly, testing, or advanced packaging 
                of semiconductors at mature technology nodes in the 
                United States; or
                    (ii) fabricate, assemble using advanced packaging, 
                or test semiconductors at mature technology nodes in 
                the United States; and
                    (B) commit to using any Federal financial 
                assistance received under this section to increase the 
                production of semiconductors at mature technology 
                nodes.
            (3) Additional criteria.--In addition to the considerations 
        described in subsection 9902(a)(2)(C) of Public Law 116-283, in 
        granting Federal financial assistance under this section, the 
        Secretary may consider whether a covered entity produces or 
        supplies equipment or materials used in the fabrication, 
        assembly, testing, or advanced packaging of semiconductors at 
        mature technology nodes that are necessary to support a 
        critical manufacturing industry.
            (4) Priority.--In awarding Federal financial assistance to 
        covered entities under this section, the Secretary shall give 
        priority to covered entities that support the resiliency of 
        semiconductor supply chains for critical manufacturing 
        industries in the United States.
            (5) Definition of critical manufacturing industry.--In this 
        section, the term ``critical manufacturing industry''--
                    (A) means an industry that is assigned a North 
                American Industry Classification System code beginning 
                with 31, 32, or 33, and for which the industry 
                components that are assigned a North American Industry 
                Classification System code beginning with the same 4 
                digits as the industry--
                            (i) manufacture primary products and parts, 
                        the sum of which account for not less than 5 
                        percent of the manufacturing value added by 
                        industry gross domestic product of the United 
                        States; and
                            (ii) employ individuals for primary 
                        products and parts manufacturing activities 
                        that, combined, account for not less than 5 
                        percent of manufacturing employment in the 
                        United States; and
                    (B) may include any other manufacturing industry 
                designated by the Secretary based on the relevance of 
                the manufacturing industry to the national and economic 
                security of the United States, including the impacts of 
                job losses.
            (6) Definition of mature technology node.--In this section, 
        the term ``mature technology node'' has the meaning given the 
        term by the Secretary of Commerce.

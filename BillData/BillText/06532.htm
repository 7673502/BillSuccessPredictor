                                 A BILL


 
To authorize funding for section 619 and part C of the Individuals with 
                      Disabilities Education Act.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Funding Early Childhood is the Right 
IDEA Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) High-quality early intervention and preschool special 
        education services can change a child's developmental 
        trajectory and improve outcomes for children, families, and 
        communities.
            (2) Part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
        Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) authorizes a grant program to aid 
        each State in implementing a system of early intervention 
        services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their 
        families.
            (3) Funding for such part C (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.) has 
        eroded significantly in the last two decades, from a high of 
        $1,768 per child in 1999 to $645 per child in 2017, adjusted 
        for inflation.
            (4) Section 619 of the Individuals with Disabilities 
        Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1419) authorizes grants to States for 
        preschool programs serving children with disabilities ages 
        three to five.
            (5) Funding for such section 619 (20 U.S.C. 1419) has 
        eroded significantly in the last 25 years, from a high of 
        $1,484 per child in 1992, to $529 in 2017, adjusted for 
        inflation.
            (6) Infants, toddlers, and preschool children, and their 
        schools would benefit from additional funding to restore per 
        child amounts under part C and section 619 of the Individuals 
        with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.; 1419) 
        to ensure continued delivery of high quality early intervention 
        and preschool special education services.

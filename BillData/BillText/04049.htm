                          for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as ``Dillon's Law''.

SEC. 2. PREFERENCE FOR STATES THAT ALLOW TRAINED INDIVIDUALS TO CARRY 
              AND ADMINISTER EPINEPHRINE.

    Section 317 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(o) Preference for States That Allow Trained Individuals To Carry 
and Administer Epinephrine.--
            ``(1) Preference.--The Secretary, in making grants under 
        this section, shall give preference to any State that--
                    ``(A) permits a trained individual to administer 
                epinephrine to any individual reasonably believed to be 
                having an anaphylactic reaction; and
                    ``(B) provides to the Secretary the certification 
                described in paragraph (2).
            ``(2) Civil liability protection law.--The certification 
        described in this paragraph is a certification made by the 
        attorney general of the State that the State--
                    ``(A) has a civil liability protection law;
                    ``(B) has reviewed such law to determine the 
                application of such law with regard to a trained 
                individual who may administer epinephrine to another 
                individual reasonably believed to be having an 
                anaphylactic reaction; and
                    ``(C) has concluded that such law provides adequate 
                civil liability protection applicable to such a trained 
                individual.
            ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        creates a cause of action or in any other way increases or 
        diminishes the liability of any person under any other law.
            ``(4) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:
                    ``(A) The term `civil liability protection law' 
                means a State law offering liability protection to 
                individuals who give aid on a voluntary basis in an 
                emergency to an individual who is ill, in peril, or 
                otherwise incapacitated.
                    ``(B) The term `trained individual' means an 
                individual--
                            ``(i) who has received training in the 
                        administration of epinephrine; and
                            ``(ii) whose training in the administration 
                        of epinephrine meets appropriate medical 
                        standards and has been approved by the 
                        State.''.

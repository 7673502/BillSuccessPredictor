                                 A BILL


 
 To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the U.S. Air Force aircrew of 
Reach 871, commonly known as the ``Reach 871'', in recognition of their 
    bravery and outstanding service during Operation Allies Refuge.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reach 871 Congressional Gold Medal 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The U.S. Air Force is an essential and integral part 
        U.S. national security and diplomatic efforts, often called 
        upon to enter extremely dangerous situations and provide 
        support and safety for combat and non-combat missions 
        worldwide.
            (2) A U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircrew, assigned 
        to the 6th Airlift Squadron, 305 Air Mobility Wing, based at 
        Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst (JBMDL), callsign Reach 871, 
        was deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Allies 
        Refuge to assist in non-combatant evacuation operations.
            (3) Reach 871 safely evacuated over 800 Afghans fleeing the 
        Taliban takeover of Kabul.
            (4) U.S. Air Force confirmed that Reach 871's evacuation 
        flight set a record for the number of personnel onboard an 
        airborne C-17 Globemaster III under any condition.
            (5) The aircrew's selfless action allowed for the safe 
        evacuation of vulnerable Afghan civilians. The crew maximized 
        previously undemonstrated capability and capacity of the 
        aircraft, while operating the aircraft in extraordinary 
        circumstances--balancing risk and capability to save the lives 
        of others.
            (6) The crew and its commander made the brave decision, in 
        accordance with their commander's intent, to evacuate as many 
        civilians as possible, including women and children, placing 
        those civilian lives and safety above all else.
            (7) The selfless service and willingness to face extreme 
        peril in order to secure the safety of Afghan civilians should 
        be recognized and honored. These Airmen exemplify the 
        patriotism and the commitment of all our brave service members 
        who have served in Afghanistan over the last 20 years and 
        risked their lives in service of our country.

and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate

            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that

        aircrew.

                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the United States Postal Service to designate a single, 
    unique ZIP Code for Fairlawn, Virginia, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ZIP CODE FOR FAIRLAWN, VIRGINIA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Commonwealth of Virginia is the only State in the 
        United States where all cities are independent from their 
        surrounding counties;
            (2) these independent cities are not politically a part of 
        the surrounding counties, even if they are located within their 
        borders;
            (3) in Virginia these independent cities are subject to 
        separate revenue collection and distribution practices related 
        to roads, resources, and sales tax than neighboring counties;
            (4) the sales tax collected from electronic commerce from 
        the unincorporated community of Fairlawn, Virginia, located in 
        Pulaski County, is often misallocated to the independent city 
        of Radford, Virginia, because they share the same ZIP Codes; 
        and
            (5) Fairlawn, Virginia, should be eligible to obtain a 
        separate and unique ZIP Code from the neighboring independent 
        city of Radford, Virginia, for tax purposes.
    (b) ZIP Code Designation.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the United States Postal Service shall 
designate a single, unique ZIP Code applicable to Fairlawn, Virginia.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

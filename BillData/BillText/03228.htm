                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator 
  of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, to improve 
   science, data, and services that enable sound decision making in 
 response to coastal flood risk, including impacts of sea level rise, 
 storm events, changing Great Lakes water levels, and land subsidence.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC 
              ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator shall, in consultation with 
other Federal agencies, develop within the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration a comprehensive suite of coastal flood and 
coastal land loss, sea level rise, Great Lakes bathymetry water level, 
and vertical land motion data, products, and services, and conduct the 
research and development necessary to support those products and 
services that--
            (1) augment existing capacities and combine existing 
        observations, modeling, predictions, products and services into 
        a coordinated decision-support framework;
            (2) produce and maintain authoritative and timely data, 
        maps, and information services, including improving existing 
        and new information products and services targeted to end-user 
        needs, that allow coastal communities across the United States 
        to plan for present and future coastal flood and coastal land 
        loss risk; and
            (3) engage with, ensure accessibility by, and provide 
        technical assistance to, end users, with particular attention 
        to historically underserved and at risk communities and 
        populations, and also including other Federal agencies, 
        regional ocean partnerships, states, local governments, Tribal 
        governments, and Indigenous communities on the appropriate 
        application of these data and tools and to better assess 
        information gaps, needs, and solutions relating to the risk 
        posed by coastal flooding and coastal land loss, including sea 
        level rise.
    (b) Data Archiving.--The Administrator shall publish and maintain 
archives of the data and metadata generated under this Act and shall 
maximize distribution, access, and use of such data and metadata.
    (c) Use of Existing Advisory Committees.--The Administrator may 
consult with and seek input from existing agency advisory committees to 
provide recommendations on systems, products, and services relating to 
coastal flooding and coastal land loss, including sea level rise.
    (d) Technical Assistance to Other Federal Agencies.--To assist in 
carrying out this Act and to facilitate collaboration, the 
Administrator may provide technical assistance to other Federal 
agencies on a reimbursable or non-reimbursable basis, including by 
entering into an agreement with another Federal agency to detail, for a 
period of not more than 3 years, an employee of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration to such other Federal agency.
    (e) International Engagement.--The Administrator, in consultation 
with the Secretary of State, may work with international counterparts 
to provide and receive technical assistance, data sharing, and capacity 
building on matters pertaining to coastal flooding and coastal land 
loss, sea level rise, and inundation, including participation in 
relevant international bodies.
    (f) Report.--The Administrator shall, not later than 1 year after 
the date of enactment of this Act and every 3 years thereafter, provide 
the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate 
with a report on actions taken to implement this Act and containing an 
evaluation of the need to expand and improve agency observations, 
modeling, predictions, products, and services to--
            (1) improve the understanding of the processes that drive 
        coastal flood and coastal land loss risk, including sea level 
        rise, storm events, changing Great Lakes water levels, and land 
        subsidence; and
            (2) track and report how observed rates of sea level rise 
        compare to the sea level rise trends and predictions published 
        within the quadrennial National Climate Assessments and related 
        reports.
    (g) Administrator.--In this section, the term ``Administrator'' 
means the Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Administrator of 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out this Section, 
there are authorized to be appropriated $3,000,000 for each of fiscal

            (1) facilitate interagency cooperation and alignment of 
        Federal Government activities conducted with respect to coastal 
        flooding and coastal land loss, including sea level rise, to 
        improve the ability of the United States to prepare for, avoid, 
        mitigate, respond to, and recover from potentially devastating 
        impacts; and
            (2) coordinate the activities of the interagency

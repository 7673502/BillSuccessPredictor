 To authorize programs to provide college scholarships and educational 
support to women and girls who have escaped Afghanistan and come to the 
                 United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Displaced Afghan Women and Girls 
Education Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS; DEFINITION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) After 20 years, August 2021 marked the end of the 
        United States military involvement in Afghanistan--the longest 
        war in American history.
            (2) As of January 27, 2022, the United States has evacuated 
        more than 76,000 Afghans through Operation Allies Welcome.
            (3) Between May and August of 2021, 80 percent of nearly 
        250,0000 Afghans forced to flee since the end of May were women 
        and children.
            (4) According to a group of United Nations human rights 
        experts, the Taliban is currently institutionalizing large-
        scaled systematic gender-based discrimination against Afghan 
        women and girls. This includes denying women and girls the 
        access to secondary and tertiary education based on their 
        gender.
            (5) On January 17, 2022, a group of 36 United Nations human 
        rights experts expressed concerns regarding ``restrictive 
        measures that have been introduced since the Taliban's takeover 
        of Afghanistan, particularly those concerning women and 
        girls''.
            (6) The United States and the international community have 
        expressed concern about Afghan women and girls, their rights to 
        education, work, and freedom of movement, and called on those 
        in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan to 
        guarantee their protection.
            (7) The United States and the international community have 
        affirmed that ``Afghan women and girls, as all Afghan people, 
        deserve to live in safety, security and dignity''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) every individual should have the opportunity to pursue 
        a full cycle of primary, secondary, and higher education; and
            (2) every individual, regardless of gender, socioeconomic 
        status, ethnicity, or religion should have the opportunity to 
        pursue an education without fear of discrimination.
    (c) Definition of Displaced Afghan Women and Girls.--The term 
``displaced Afghan women and girls'' means women and girls who escaped 
or fled Afghanistan and entered the United States on or after July 1, 
2021, and before the date that is two years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and who are domiciled in the United States.

SEC. 3. SPECIAL OFFICIAL FOR DISPLACED AFGHAN WOMEN AND GIRLS.

    Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, shall designate a qualified individual to serve as the Special 
Official for Displaced Afghan Women and Girls. Such Special Official 
shall--
            (1) have not less than 10 years of experience in the fields 
        of education and immigration, including expertise related to 
        Afghanistan;
            (2) coordinate and oversee, under the direction of the 
        Secretary and in consultation with the Office of Federal 
        Student Aid, the Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, 
        and the Office of Postsecondary Education of the Department of 
        Education (as appropriate), the programs authorized under this 
        Act and the amendments made by this Act; and
            (3) report to the Secretary of Education and Congress on 
        the effectiveness and outcomes of such programs.

                                 A BILL


 
     To provide for a study by the National Academies of Sciences, 
   Engineering, and Medicine on the potential benefits on population 
 health outcomes of incorporating into the Federal legislative process 
 tools that measure the impacts of proposed legislation (including in 
areas outside of health care) on health and health disparities, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Assessing Health Evaluations to 
Advance Decision-making Act of 2022'' or the ``AHEAD Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. STUDY TO ASSESS THE VALUE OF USING TOOLS TO MEASURE THE IMPACTS 
              OF PROPOSED FEDERAL LEGISLATION ON HEALTH AND HEALTH 
              DISPARITIES.

    (a) Study.--Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in 
this section as the ``Secretary'') shall enter into an arrangement with 
the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (referred 
to in this section as the ``National Academies'') (or, if the National 
Academies decline to enter into such arrangement, with another 
appropriate entity such as the National Academy of Public 
Administration) under which the National Academies (or other 
appropriate entity) will complete a study to--
            (1) examine the potential benefits on population health 
        outcomes of incorporating into the Federal legislative process 
        tools that measure the impacts of proposed legislation 
        (including in areas outside of health care) on health and 
        health disparities;
            (2) formulate recommendations on integrating such tools 
        into the Federal legislative process to achieve better 
        population health outcomes;
            (3) formulate recommendations on how behavioral and nudge 
        research on the effects of health disparities may translate 
        into evaluative tools for policymakers; and
            (4) consider, with input from the Comptroller General of 
        the United States, the Director of the Congressional Budget 
        Office, and the Director of the Congressional Research Service, 
        how such tools could be incorporated into the Federal 
        legislative process.
    (b) Tools To Be Considered.--The tools considered under the study 
under subsection (a) shall include health impact assessments, and may 
include any other tools of analysis, particularly such tools related to 
impacts on health and health disparities.
    (c) Specific Populations To Be Considered.--The study under 
subsection (a) shall consider the impacts described in such subsection 
on health and health disparities within specific populations, including 
racial and ethnic minority groups (as defined in section 1707(g) of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300u-6(g))), youth, women, older 
adults, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural 
communities, individuals living in rural Tribal or urban Indian 
communities, individuals living in regions with persistent poverty, 
individuals with co-morbid conditions, individuals with disabilities, 
individuals who are homeless, and individuals involved with the 
criminal justice system, among others.
    (d) Congressional and Regulatory Process Options.--The study under 
subsection (a) shall consider how assessments of potential population 
health outcomes could be incorporated into Federal legislative and 
regulatory processes, including by evaluating options with respect to--
            (1) methodological tools for evaluating evidentiary 
        standards across multiple disciplines and the potential 
        benefits and negative effects of a proposed policy;
            (2) the processes and considerations for preparing a 
        population health outcomes report, including time, resources, 
        community consultation, and competencies required to review 
        relevant scientific literature;
            (3) entities that conduct population health outcomes 
        reports by comparing the experiences of State and local 
        jurisdictions that have incorporated health impacts assessments 
        in legislative or regulatory processes; and
            (4) potential uses of a population health outcomes report 
        in the Federal legislative and regulatory processes.
    (e) Report.--The arrangement under subsection (a) shall provide for 
the submission of a report on the results of the study under such 
subsection, not later than 30 months after the date of enactment of 
this Act, to the Secretary, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of 
the House of Representatives.

        the individual beneficiary, such as women;
            (4) the affordability of assistive devices;

        acclimation to assistive devices; and
            (6) appropriate timelines for assessments for surgery and 
        assessments of assistive devices.
    (b) Comparison of Certain Data.--As part of the evaluation 
conducted under subsection (a), the Comptroller General shall compare

        after receiving a prosthetic device comparable to other 
        assistive technologies;
            (6) reductions in long-term assistive technology services 
        and supports;
            (7) with respect to those using assistive technologies, 
        policies to reduce falls and secondary complications, such as 
        diabetes, heart disease, vascular disease, and others; and
            (8) the amount expended by individual entities on 
        prosthetics relative to total amount expended by such entities.

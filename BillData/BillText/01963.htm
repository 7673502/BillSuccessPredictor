                        with the subsidy value of child care services 
                        provided if the child were enrolled with a

                        rates.--When setting differential rates on the 
                        basis of child care quality, States are 
                        prohibited from using type of child care (such 
                        as family child care or center-based care) or 
                        type of provider (such as nonprofit providers, 
                        for-profit providers, or faith-based providers)

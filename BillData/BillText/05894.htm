Federal funds may be used to fund research or publications relating to 
gender transition in individuals under the age of 18, including any 
observational studies that gather evidence on the provision of hormonal 
treatments or surgical procedures on minors, for the purpose of--
            (1) affirming a minor's perception of his or her sex, if 
        that perception is incongruent with such minor's sex; or
            (2) affirming a minor's asserted identity, if the asserted 
        identity is incongruent with such minor's sex.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``sex'' 
shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and 
genetics at birth.

seq.) and the Six Assurances, to provide the people of Taiwan with de

Office is designated as the Taiwan Representative Office, any reference 
in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, or other record of the 
United States Government to the Taipei Economic and Cultural

Representative Office, including for all official purposes of the 
Government of the United States, all courts of the United States, and 
any proceedings therein.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be

States with respect to the international status of Taiwan.

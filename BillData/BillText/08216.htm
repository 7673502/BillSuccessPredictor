                                 A BILL


 
           To promote digital citizenship and media literacy.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Digital Citizenship and Media 
Literacy Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) People in the United States rely on information from 
        mass media, social media, and digital media to make decisions 
        about all aspects of social, economic, and political life, 
        including products and services consumption, employment, career 
        and professional development, family and leisure choices, 
        health and wellness, and democratic engagement. Ensuring that 
        people in the United States possess the skills to make these 
        informed decisions based on media begins early in life.
            (2) Adversaries from Russia, China, and Iran are using 
        information warfare to influence democracies across the world, 
        and terrorist organizations often use digital communications to 
        recruit members. The United States can fight these influences 
        by ensuring that citizens of the United States possess the 
        necessary skills to discern disinformation and misinformation 
        and think critically about their digital activities.
            (3) Media literacy education has proven critical to allies 
        of the United States in building national resilience to foreign 
        disinformation campaigns. Countries like Estonia, Finland, and 
        Ukraine have developed and implemented successful media 
        literacy education programs in schools that have helped counter 
        Russian disinformation campaigns. The United States has also 
        invested in and promoted media literacy education abroad, 
        including in the Baltics.
            (4) Following Russia's increased aggression towards Ukraine 
        and the West this year, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, media 
        literacy skills have been important in ensuring Ukrainians and 
        citizens of Western allied countries are not influenced by 
        Russian disinformation.
            (5) In order to build similar national resilience against 
        foreign disinformation in the United States, Congress has 
        recommended investing in media literacy education.
            (6) The bipartisan and bicameral Cyberspace Solarium 
        Commission's 2020 report recommended that the United States 
        invest in media literacy, writing that ``[b]y promoting modern 
        civics education and digital literacy programs, the U.S. 
        government can assist in enhancing the average American's 
        ability to discern the trustworthiness of online content, and 
        thereby reduce the impact of malicious foreign cyber-enabled 
        information campaigns'', and concluded that Congress should 
        authorize a grant program ``to improve digital citizenship and 
        to incorporate effective digital literacy curricula in American 
        classrooms at the K-12 level and beyond''.
            (7) Similarly, the Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
        Senate stated, in a bipartisan report released during the 116th 
        Congress, ``Addressing the challenge of disinformation in the 
        long-term will ultimately need to be tackled by an informed and 
        discerning population of citizens who are both alert to the 
        threat and armed with the critical thinking skills necessary to 
        protect against malicious influence.'' The Committee then 
        recommended that a ``public initiative--propelled by Federal 
        funding but led in large part by state and local education 
        institutions--focused on building media literacy from an early 
        age would help build long-term resilience to foreign 
        manipulation of our democracy''.
            (8) Media literacy and digital citizenship education also 
        empowers young people and is critical to improving the health 
        and wellness of young people, preventing cyberbullying, and 
        enabling young people to make informed decisions about products 
        and services, including advertisements and controlled 
        substances.
            (9) Social media and other online activities have been 
        shown to have serious negative impacts on the mental and 
        physical health of young people. Many studies have found that 
        media literacy education is one of the most successful 
        strategies for countering body image issues and eating 
        disorders in children. The National Eating Disorders 
        Association, in partnership with California State University, 
        Northridge, published a Digital Media Literacy toolkit to help 
        students, including high school students, learn skills to think 
        critically about body images and the online content they see.
            (10) Education and childhood development experts, as well 
        as academic and medical researchers, have recommended that a 
        key method for preventing and countering the negative impacts 
        described in paragraph (9) is to teach media literacy skills to 
        young people beginning early in their education.
            (11) A successful and inclusive media literacy program must 
        be directed at students beginning in kindergarten and should 
        continue throughout the completion of postsecondary education. 
        Media literacy education must be inclusive and accessible for 
        all students, including multilingual students, students with 
        limited proficiency in English, and students with disabilities. 
        Learning to critically analyze and create media is a lifelong 
        process that can be developed by integrating media literacy 
        competencies into academic curriculum across content areas and 
        disciplines.

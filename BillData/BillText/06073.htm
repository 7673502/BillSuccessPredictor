    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

        Maritime Commission.
            (2) Interoperable gray chassis pool.--The term 
        ``interoperable gray chassis pool'' means a single enterprise 
        for voluntary chassis provisioning that allows for the use of 
        any container chassis for marine shipping containers not less 
        than 20 feet and not more than 45 feet in length at the rail 
        ramps around Memphis, Tennessee, by shippers or motor carriers.
    (b) Development of Plan.--

        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Transportation, in 
        coordination with the Commission, shall develop a plan to issue 
        a request for proposals to develop an operating model for an 
        interoperable gray chassis pool at the rail ramps around 
        Memphis, Tennessee.
            (2) Plan details.--In developing the plan under paragraph 
        (1), the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the 
        Commission, shall identify a suitable location or locations for 
        the interoperable gray chassis pool and consult with relevant 
        stakeholders, including the International Port of Memphis, 
        ocean carriers, railroad carriers, motor carriers, chassis 
        providers, shippers, and the Surface Transportation Board.

                        and receiving feedback from Memphis 
                        stakeholders regarding the interoperable gray 
                        chassis pool; and

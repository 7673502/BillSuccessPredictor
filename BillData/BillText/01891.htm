            (1) in paragraph (1) by striking ``lands within the State 
        of Oregon'' and inserting ``the 84 acres known as the Thompson 
        Strip'';
            (2) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3); and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:
            ``(2) Gaming prohibition.--Any real property obtained by 
        the Tribes as part of a land claim settlement approved by the 
        United States shall not be eligible, or used, for any class II 
        gaming or class III gaming under the Indian Gaming Regulatory 
        Act (25 U.S.C. 2701, et seq.) (as those terms are defined in

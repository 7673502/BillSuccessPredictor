                                 A BILL


 
   To protect stateless persons in the United States, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stateless Protection Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to resolve the status of stateless persons in the 
        United States and to promote their access to fundamental human 
        rights and human dignity; and
            (2) to prevent statelessness from occurring under United 
        States law or on United States territory.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The international community has recognized the 
        significance of the right to a nationality in the International 
        Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at New York 
        December 16, 1966, to which the United States is a signatory, 
        as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
        numerous international treaties, including the Convention 
        Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, done at New York 
        September 28, 1954, and the Convention on the Reduction of 
        Statelessness, done at New York August 30, 1961.
            (2) Statelessness is an abhorrent violation of fundamental 
        human rights and human dignity, and a life of statelessness has 
        been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States as a 
        form of punishment more primitive than torture.
            (3) Government action and inaction causes statelessness; 
        therefore, governments have the power to resolve and prevent 
        statelessness.
            (4) The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees--
                    (A) is the United Nations agency responsible for 
                preventing and reducing statelessness; and
                    (B) estimates that there are more than 4,200,000 
                stateless persons worldwide.
            (5) A 2020 study found that there are approximately 218,000 
        individuals living in the United States who are stateless or at 
        risk of statelessness.
            (6) Stateless individuals live in all 50 States, and many 
        such individuals have lived in the United States for years or 
        decades without relief.
            (7) Despite the presence of stateless persons in the United 
        States, there is no law relating to the identification of 
        stateless persons in the United States or to provide them with 
        a path to legal status.
            (8) Stateless persons generally--
                    (A) live without the means to work legally or to 
                travel; and
                    (B) face barriers in opening bank accounts, 
                pursuing higher education, and obtaining health care.
            (9) If detained for removal from the United States, a 
        stateless person is often subjected to prolonged detention and 
        cannot be removed because no country recognizes the person as 
        its citizen.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that to resolve 
statelessness and its related human suffering, lost potential, and 
societal impacts, the United States should--
            (1) provide a legal status to protect stateless persons; 
        and
            (2) urge the international community to take strong action 
        to prevent statelessness globally.

                        of the enactment of this section, unless the 
                        renunciation was the result of duress,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Air Force Rated Officer Retention 
Program Act''.

SEC. 2. AIR FORCE RATED OFFICER RETENTION DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM.

    (a) Program Requirement.--The Secretary shall establish and carry 
out within the Department of the Air Force a demonstration program to 
assess and improve retention on active duty in the Air Force of rated 
officers described in subsection (b).
    (b) Rated Officers Described.--Rated officers described in this 
subsection are rated officers serving on active duty in the Air Force, 
excluding rated officers with a reserve appointment in the Air National 
Guard or Air Force Reserve--
            (1) whose continued service on active duty would be in the 
        best interest of the Department of the Air Force, as determined 
        by the Secretary; and
            (2) who have not more than three years and not less than 
        one year remaining on an active duty service obligation under 
        section 653 of title 10, United States Code.
    (c) Written Agreement.--
            (1) In general.--Under the demonstration program required 
        under subsection (a), the Secretary shall offer retention 
        incentives under subsection (d) to a rated officer described in 
        subsection (b) who executes a written agreement to remain on 
        active duty in a regular component of the Air Force for not 
        less than four years after the completion of the active duty 
        service obligation of the officer under section 653 of title 
        10, United States Code.
            (2) Exception.--If the Secretary of the Air Force 
        determines that an assignment previously guaranteed under 
        subsection (d)(1) to a rated officer described in subsection 
        (b) cannot be fulfilled, the agreement of the officer under 
        paragraph (1) to remain on active duty shall expire not later 
        than one year after that determination.
    (d) Retention Incentives.--
            (1) Guarantee of future assignment location.--Under the 
        demonstration program required under subsection (a), the 
        Secretary may offer to a rated officer described in subsection 
        (b) a guarantee of future assignment locations based on the 
        preference of the officer.
            (2) Aviation bonus.--Under the demonstration program 
        required under subsection (a), notwithstanding section 334(c) 
        of title 37, United States Code, the Secretary may pay to a 
        rated officer described in subsection (b) an aviation bonus not 
        to exceed an average annual amount of $50,000 (subject to 
        paragraph (3)(B)).
            (3) Combination of incentives.--The Secretary may offer to 
        a rated officer described in subsection (b) a combination of 
        incentives under paragraphs (1) and (2).
            (4) Variations; limitations.--The Secretary may vary or 
        limit the total number of available contracts and the 
        combination of incentives within such contracts to target 
        certain Air Force specialty codes, ensure required assignments 
        locations are filled, and readiness is not negatively affected. 
        The Secretary shall determine the criteria for such variations 
        or limitations and include such criteria in the annual briefing 
        under subsection (e).
    (e) Annual Briefing.--Not later than December 31, 2023, and 
annually thereafter until the termination of the demonstration program 
required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall provide to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives a briefing describing the use of such demonstration 
program and its effects on the retention on active duty in the Air 
Force of rated officers described in subsection (b).

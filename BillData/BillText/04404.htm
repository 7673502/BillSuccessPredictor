 To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate segments of the

              KISSIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA.

    Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--The restored segment of 
        the Kissimmee River, beginning approximately 16 miles 
        downstream of Lake Kissimmee and ending approximately 15 miles 
        upstream of Lake Okeechobee.''.

SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS.

    Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1276(b)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(__) Kissimmee river, florida.--Not later than 3 years 
        after the date on which funds are made available to carry out 
        this paragraph, the Secretary of the Interior shall--

SEC. 4. EFFECT ON MANAGEMENT.

    This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not interfere 
with the current management of the area of the Kissimmee River 
described in section 5(a)(_) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, nor 
shall the fact that such area is listed for study under the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as justification for 
more restrictive management until Congress acts on the study 
recommendations.

            Passed the House of Representatives July 19, 2022.

            Attest:

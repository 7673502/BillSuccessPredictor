          relations treatment) to the products of Kazakhstan.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Kazakhstan allows its citizens the right and 
        opportunity to emigrate, free of any heavy tax on emigration or 
        on the visas or other documents required for emigration and 
        free of any tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any 
        citizens, as a consequence of the desire of those citizens to 
        emigrate to the country of their choice.
            (2) Kazakhstan has been found to be in full compliance with 
        the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the 
        Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) since 1994.
            (3) Kazakhstan has received normal trade relations 
        treatment since concluding a bilateral trade agreement with the 
        United States that entered into force in 1992.
            (4) On November 30, 2015, Kazakhstan officially acceded to 
        the World Trade Organization.

SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974 
              TO THE PRODUCTS OF KAZAKHSTAN.

    (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of Nondiscriminatory 
Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act 
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may--
            (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to 
        Kazakhstan; and
            (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with 
        respect to Kazakhstan, proclaim the extension of 
        nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations treatment) 
        to the products of Kazakhstan.
    (b) Termination of Applicability of Title IV.--On and after the 
date on which the President extends nondiscriminatory treatment to the 
products of Kazakhstan pursuant to subsection (a), title IV of the 
Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) shall cease to apply to 
Kazakhstan.

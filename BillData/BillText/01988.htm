To amend title 36, United States Code, to direct the President to issue 
   an annual proclamation establishing Women's Military History Day.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Women's Military History Day Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On March 21, 1917, Loretta Perfectus Walsh became the 
        first woman in United States history to officially enlist in 
        any military service when she joined the United States Navy in 
        the month that would later be designated Women's History Month.
            (2) Women have served in the United States Armed Forces 
        since the Revolutionary War, initially serving in support roles 
        as nurses, seamstresses, and cooks for troops.
            (3) Valiant women have served selflessly alongside men 
        during every conflict involving the United States, and have 
        suffered the same hardships, often without the benefit of 
        military rank or compensation.
            (4) Pioneering women have served as trailblazers, inspiring 
        generations of American women to follow in their footsteps by 
        answering the call to serve.
            (5) On January 21, 1918, Myrtle Hazard became the first 
        woman to officially take the oath of enlistment for the United 
        States Coast Guard, joining twin sisters, Genevieve and Lucille 
        Baker.
            (6) On August 13, 1918, Opha May Johnson joined the United 
        States Marine Corps before she, or any woman, was permitted to 
        vote.
            (7) On July 8, 1948, Esther McGowin Blake, having already 
        joined the Army Air Forces in 1944, enlisted in the active duty 
        United States Air Force, and served beside her two sons.
            (8) Deborah Sampson was, by scholarly consensus, the first 
        woman to serve in the United States Army, when she disguised 
        herself as a man to join the Continental Army, in which she 
        served until 1783.
            (9) In 2015, Department of Defense formally announced women 
        could serve in direct combat roles and join combat arms 
        professions.
            (10) Army Captains Shaye Haver and Kristen Griest were the 
        first females to graduate the United States Army's Ranger 
        School, and Sergeant First Class Amanda Kelley was the first 
        enlisted female to do so.
            (11) There are nearly 2,000,000 living female veterans of 
        the United States Armed Forces who represent approximately 10 
        percent of the overall veteran population.
            (12) The United States holds these iconic women, and every 
        woman who has served in the United States military, in the 
        highest regard for their courage and bravery.
    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to encourage the 
nationwide observance of ``Women's Military History Day'' on a day in 
the month of March.

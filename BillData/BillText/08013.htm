    (h) Carbon Accounting Coordination Working Group and Data Plan.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
                    (A) multiple Federal agencies and programs collect 
                data on carbon emissions and sinks related to carbon 
                dioxide removal;
                    (B) Federal carbon emissions and sinks data 
                collection efforts are siloed, with different 
                methodological approaches to collection, multiple data 
                warehouse locations, potential redundancies in data 
                collected, and gaps in coverage; and
                    (C) improved coordination of carbon measurement, 
                monitoring, and data aggregation related to carbon 
                dioxide removal is needed to support the development 
                and deployment of carbon dioxide removal methods and 
                strategies at scale.
            (2) Objective.--The objective of this subsection is to 
        establish a comprehensive, multi-agency plan for the collection 
        and management of data on carbon emissions and sinks related to 
        carbon dioxide removal that--
                    (A) enables comprehensive reporting on carbon 
                dioxide removal based on full and consistent 
                integration with existing relevant data collection 
                efforts across the Federal Government; and
                    (B) provides policymakers with information on the 
                effectiveness of carbon dioxide removal and carbon 
                sequestration activities.
            (3) Establishment.--The executive committee shall establish 
        a working group on carbon dioxide removal-related data 
        collection and management.
            (4) Data plan elements.--The working group established in 
        paragraph (3) shall develop a data plan that includes--
                    (A) an inventory of existing Federal data sources 
                on carbon emissions and sinks related to carbon dioxide 
                removal;
                    (B) a description of the scope of activities for 
                which new data on emissions and sinks related to carbon 
                dioxide removal should be collected;
                    (C) methodologies for collection of carbon dioxide 
                removal-related data;
                    (D) the roles of the respective Federal agencies in 
                collection and management of carbon dioxide removal-
                related data in meeting agency-specific mission 
                requirements in coordination with governmentwide 
                comprehensive carbon accounting objectives; and
                    (E) data collection and management protocols and 
                practices to facilitate integration of data on 
                emissions and sinks related to carbon dioxide removal 
                into comprehensive reports on carbon removal and 
                accounting on a nationwide scale.
            (5) Considerations.--The data plan shall, at a minimum, 
        consider and address--
                    (A) the role of existing programs that document 
                carbon emissions and sinks, including but not limited 
                to the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the 
                Environmental Protection Agency's Greenhouse Gas 
                Reporting Program;
                    (B) how the effectiveness of carbon dioxide removal 
                projects (as defined by the Committee) can be tracked 
                and effectively managed over time;
                    (C) gaps in existing Federal data collection 
                efforts that delay progress on carbon dioxide removal 
                experimenting, prototyping, and production;
                    (D) how data collection on carbon dioxide removal 
                projects could incorporate best practices for the 
                accounting of--
                            (i) additionality, which is the 
                        counterfactual assessment of carbon dioxide 
                        emitted without the occurrence of a carbon 
                        dioxide removal practice;
                            (ii) permanence, which is an assessment of 
                        the time scale of climate impacts for a carbon 
                        dioxide removal practice in comparison to the 
                        time scale of greenhouse gases impacting 
                        climate change;
                            (iii) risk of reversal, which is a 
                        probabilistic assessment of a carbon dioxide 
                        removal practice storing carbon for a shorter 
                        period of time than the time scale identified 
                        in clause (ii);
                            (iv) lifecycle environmental, socio-
                        economic, and community impacts of a carbon 
                        dioxide removal practice; and
                            (v) transparency, which is the ability for 
                        the public to easily access information 
                        regarding carbon dioxide removal practices, 
                        including information listed in this 
                        subparagraph; and
                    (E) how the gaps identified in subparagraph (C) can 
                be remedied to ensure the qualities listed in 
                subparagraph (D) are measured, potentially through the 
                consolidation of resources or the creation of a new 
                database intended for supporting carbon dioxide removal 
                over time.
            (6) Reports.--
                    (A) Expert participation.--The working group shall 
                establish a process for engagement with the scientific 
                community and stakeholder groups in the development of 
                the data plan.
                    (B) Public review.--Within 180 days of enactment of 
                this subsection, the Committee shall make available a 
                draft report for public review and comment. The working 
                group shall consider public comments in the process of 
                finalizing the data plan.
                    (C) Reports to congress.--
                            (i) Not later than 1 year after the date of 
                        enactment of this subsection, the executive 
                        committee shall submit to Congress the initial 
                        data plan.
                            (ii) Along with each submission of the 
                        President pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, 
                        United States Code, the executive committee 
                        shall submit to Congress a report on the 
                        findings of the Committee with respect to 
                        implementation of the data plan along with any 
                        recommendations for modification of the plan.

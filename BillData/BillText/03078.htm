SEC. 2. PHYSICAL SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY FOR PIPELINES AND LIQUEFIED 
              NATURAL GAS FACILITIES.

    The Secretary of Energy, in carrying out the Department of Energy's

        Federal agencies, States, and the energy sector, including 
        through councils or other entities engaged in sharing, 
        analysis, or sector coordinating, to ensure the security, 
        resiliency, and survivability of natural gas pipelines 
        (including natural gas transmission and distribution 
        pipelines), hazardous liquid pipelines, and liquefied natural 
        gas facilities;
            (2) to coordinate response and recovery by Federal 
        agencies, States, and the energy sector, to physical incidents 
        and cyber incidents impacting the energy sector;
            (3) to develop, for voluntary use, advanced cybersecurity 
        applications and technologies for natural gas pipelines 
        (including natural gas transmission and distribution 
        pipelines), hazardous liquid pipelines, and liquefied natural 
        gas facilities;
            (4) to perform pilot demonstration projects relating to 
        physical security and cybersecurity for natural gas pipelines 
        (including natural gas transmission and distribution 
        pipelines), hazardous liquid pipelines, and liquefied natural 
        gas facilities with representatives of the energy sector;
            (5) to develop workforce development curricula for the 
        energy sector relating to physical security and cybersecurity 
        for natural gas pipelines (including natural gas transmission 
        and distribution pipelines), hazardous liquid pipelines, and 
        liquefied natural gas facilities; and
            (6) to provide technical tools to help the energy sector 
        voluntarily evaluate, prioritize, and improve physical security 
        and cybersecurity capabilities of natural gas pipelines 
        (including natural gas transmission and distribution 
        pipelines), hazardous liquid pipelines, and liquefied natural 
        gas facilities.

SEC. 3. SAVINGS CLAUSE.

    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to modify the authority of

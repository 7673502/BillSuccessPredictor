                                 A BILL


 
 To establish a lending program for Latin America and the Caribbean to 
reaffirm the United States commitment to growth and energy security in 
                        the Western Hemisphere.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Las Americas Energy Security Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE; STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Energy independence and security are critical for a 
        country to maintain its sovereignty and independence.
            (2) The International Energy Agency (``IEA'') defines 
        energy security as the uninterrupted availability of energy 
        sources at an affordable price.
            (3) The IEA defines long-term energy security as primarily 
        dealing with timely investments to supply energy in line with 
        economic developments and environmental needs.
            (4) The IEA defines short-term energy security as focusing 
        on the ability of a country's energy system to react promptly 
        to sudden changes in the supply-demand balance.
            (5) The IEA found in February 2022 that Russia's unlawful 
        invasion of Ukraine poses serious implications for 
        international energy security.
            (6) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a 
        United Nations body that provides regular assessments on 
        climate change, issued its sixth report in February 2022, and 
        found that ``human-induced climate change, including more 
        frequent and intense extreme events, has caused widespread 
        adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and 
        people, beyond natural climate variability''.
            (7) The IPCC notes that to avoid mounting loss of life, 
        biodiversity, and infrastructure, we must have ambitious, 
        accelerated action to adapt to climate change, while also 
        making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
            (8) The World Meteorological Organization's State of the 
        Climate in Latin America and the Caribbean 2020 report found 
        that--
                    (A) widespread drought across Latin America and the 
                Caribbean has had significant impact on inland shipping 
                routes, crop yields, and food production, and 
                consequently led to worsening food insecurity;
                    (B) extreme weather events affected more than 8 
                million people across Central America, exacerbating 
                food insecurity in countries already crippled by 
                economic shocks, COVID-19 impacts, and conflict; and
                    (C) sea-level rise poses a major risk to low-lying 
                coastal zones in the Latin America and the Caribbean.
            (9) Rising commodity and energy prices, as well as other 
        global economic shocks such as those caused by natural 
        disasters, pandemics, and conflict, pose a serious food 
        security risk that may lead to social unrest and instability in 
        Latin America and the Caribbean.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States has economic and national security interests in assisting Latin 
America and the Caribbean to achieve energy security.
    (c) Statement of Policy.-- It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to advance United States foreign policy and development 
        goals by helping Latin America and the Caribbean meet its 
        short-term energy needs;
            (2) to promote the energy security of Latin America and the 
        Caribbean by encouraging the development of accessible, 
        transparent, and competitive energy markets that provide 
        diversified sources, types, and routes of energy, prioritizing 
        renewable energy practices that address challenges posed by 
        climate change;
            (3) to encourage United States public and private sector 
        investment in Latin American and Caribbean energy 
        infrastructure projects to bridge the gap between energy 
        security requirements and commercial demand in a way that is 
        consistent with the region's absorptive capacity, and that 
        recognizes the importance of building and widening the 
        absorptive capacity of the region; and
            (4) to help facilitate the export of United States energy 
        resources, technology, and expertise to global markets in a way 
        that benefits the energy security of Latin America and the 
        Caribbean.

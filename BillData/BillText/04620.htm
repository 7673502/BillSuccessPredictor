                            ``(ii) may include a family office with 
                        fewer assets under management than the 
                        threshold described under subparagraph (A), if 
                        the Commission, by rule, determines the family 
                        office is highly leveraged or engaged in high-
                        risk activities that the Commission determines 
                        warrants inclusion, as appropriate to protect

        advisers exempted by reason of this subsection to maintain such

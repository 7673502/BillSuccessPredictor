   To provide for the issuance of a Lyme Disease Research Semipostal 
                                 Stamp.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stamp Out Lyme Disease Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
        estimate that 476,000 Lyme disease cases are diagnosed and 
        treated in the United States annually.
            (2) The CDC reports that Lyme disease is difficult to 
        diagnose due to its diverse manifestations and a lack of 
        reliable testing options.
            (3) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that a 
        significant number of later-stage or post-treatment Lyme 
        disease patients are not cured.
            (4) The Tick-Borne Disease Working Group reports that 10 to 
        20 percent of Lyme disease patients will suffer from persistent 
        symptoms which can be chronic and disabling.
            (5) According to the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of 
        Public Health, Lyme disease costs the United States healthcare 
        system up to $1,300,000,000 per year.
    (b) Purpose.--To afford a convenient way for members of the public 
to contribute to funding for Lyme disease and related tick-borne 
illness research within the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, the United States Postal Service shall issue a 
semipostal stamp (hereinafter in this Act referred to as the ``Lyme 
Disease Research Semipostal Stamp'') in accordance with this section.

        416(d)(4) of such title 39, amounts becoming available from the

        funding to be furnished in any year to the National Institute 
        of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
    (c) Duration.--The Lyme Disease Research Semipostal Stamp shall be 
made available to the public for a period of at least 6 years, 
beginning no later than 12 months after the date of the enactment of 
this Act.

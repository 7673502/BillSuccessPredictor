 To reimburse the State of Texas for the costs of Operation Lone Star, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lone Star Reimbursement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The House of Representatives recognized the security of 
        our Nation's borders as a matter of national security in the 
        National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022.
            (2) The Texas Military Department has reported 48,900 
        migrants attempting to cross the Texas Mexico Border.
            (3) The Texas Military Department has apprehended and 
        referred over 134,000 migrants to law enforcement.
            (4) The Texas Military Department has turned back and 
        denied the crossing into Texas of 16,700 migrants resulting in 
        no mass migrations across the border during Operation Lone 
        Star.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Operation 
Lone Star has been a tremendous help to stem the tide of illegal 
immigration and its members should be recognized for their efforts.

SEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT.

    Of amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to the 
Department of Defense for fiscal year 2022, $1,434,094,366 shall be 
expended in the form of reimbursements to the State of Texas for the 
costs of Operation Lone Star incurred in fiscal years 2021 and 2022.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

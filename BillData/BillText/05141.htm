SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Maximizing Outcomes through Better 
Investments in Lifesaving Equipment for (MOBILE) Health Care Act''.

    (a) In General.--Section 330(e)(6)(A) of the Public Health Service 
Act (42 U.S.C. 254b(e)(6)(A)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
                            ``(v) Mobile units.--An existing health 
                        center may be awarded funds under clause (i) to 
                        establish a new delivery site that is a mobile 
                        unit, regardless of whether the applicant 
                        additionally proposes to establish a permanent, 
                        full-time site. In the case of a health center

                        this section, such health center may be awarded 
                        funds under clause (i) to establish a new 
                        delivery site that is a mobile unit only if 
                        such health center uses a portion of such funds 
                        to also establish a permanent, full-time 
                        site.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect on January 1, 2024.

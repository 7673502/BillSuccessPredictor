SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Security Cooperation with 
Allied Partners in Europe Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reduce the dependency of allies and partners of the 
        United States on Russian energy resources, especially natural 
        gas, in order for those countries to achieve lasting and 
        dependable energy security;
            (2) to condemn the Government of the Russian Federation 
        for, and to deter that government from, using its energy 
        resources as a geopolitical weapon to coerce, intimidate, and 
        influence other countries;
            (3) to improve energy security in Europe by increasing 
        access to diverse, reliable, and affordable energy;
            (4) to promote energy security in Europe by working with 
        the European Union and other allies of the United States to 
        develop liberalized energy markets that provide diversified 
        energy sources, suppliers, and routes;
            (5) to continue to strongly oppose the Nord Stream 2 
        pipeline based on its detrimental effects on the energy 
        security of the European Union and the economy of Ukraine and 
        other countries in Central Europe through which natural gas is 
        transported; and
            (6) to support countries that are allies or partners of the 
        United States by expediting the export of energy resources from 
        the United States.

Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

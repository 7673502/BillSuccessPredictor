        invest in the research and development of distributed ledger 
        technologies and their applications, including through programs 
        like the Small Business Innovation Research program, the Small 
        Business Technology Transfer program, and the National Science 
        Foundation's Innovation Corps programs.
            (2)(A) The potential benefits and risks of applications of 
        distributed ledger technologies across different industry 
        sectors, including their potential to--
                    (i) lower transactions costs and facilitate new 
                types of commercial transactions;
                    (ii) protect privacy and increase individuals' data 
                sovereignty;

        scalability, interoperability, security, and privacy of 
        applications using distributed ledger technologies.
            (5) The need for increased coordination of the public and 
        private sectors on the development of voluntary standards in 
        order to promote research and development, including standards 
        regarding security, smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, 
        virtual routing and forwarding, interoperability, zero-
        knowledge proofs, and privacy, for distributed ledger 
        technologies and their applications.
            (6) Applications of distributed ledger technologies that 
        could positively benefit society but that receive relatively 
        little private sector investment.

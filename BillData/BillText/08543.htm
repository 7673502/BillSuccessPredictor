        order, or warrant (including a subpoena or court order obtained 
        by a person that is not a government entity), or to provide 
        information as otherwise required by law.
            (2) To respond to a circumstance that would cause a 
        reasonable person to believe that disclosure of the covered 
        information to the third party is necessary to prevent physical 
        harm to an individual.
    (b) Notice of Disclosure.--
            (1) Requirement.--Unless prohibited by law, a manufacturer 
        of a covered device shall notify a user of such device whose 
        covered information is disclosed to a third party by such 
        manufacturer.
            (2) Contents.--The notice required by paragraph (1) shall

        information for the user. If the manufacturer does not have 
        such contact information, the manufacturer shall provide such

        with the covered device.
            (5) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        be construed to require a manufacturer of a covered device to--
                    (A) take an action that would convert information 
                that is not covered information into covered

purposes for which the covered information is collected.

SEC. 6. SAFE HARBOR.

    (a) Deemed Compliance.--A manufacturer of a covered device shall be

by other persons, that is approved under subsection (b).
    (b) Approval of Guidelines.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after receiving a 
        request for approval of a set of self-regulatory guidelines 
        described in subsection (a), after notice and comment, the 
        Commission shall--
                    (A) if the Commission determines that such set of

                such set of guidelines; and
                    (B) if the Commission determines that such set of 
                guidelines does not meet the requirements of this Act, 
                deny approval of such set of guidelines.
            (2) Written conclusions.--The Commission shall set forth in 
        writing its conclusions relating to a determination under

of the United States of appropriate jurisdiction as provided for in 
section 706 of title 5, United States Code.

SEC. 7. ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Enforcement by Federal Trade Commission.--
            (1) Unfair or deceptive acts or practices.--A violation of 
        this Act shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an 
        unfair or deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 
        18(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
        57a(a)(1)(B)).
            (2) Actions by the commission.--The Commission shall 
        enforce this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and 
        with the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all 
        applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission 
        Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into and made a 
        part of this Act, and any person who violates this Act shall be 
        subject to the penalties and entitled to the privileges and 
        immunities provided in the Federal Trade Commission Act.
    (b) Enforcement by State Attorneys General.--
            (1) In general.--If the attorney general of a State has 
        reason to believe that any person has committed or is 
        committing a violation of this Act that affects one or more 
        residents of such State, such attorney general may bring a 
        civil action exclusively in an appropriate district court of

            (2) Rule of construction.--For purposes of bringing a civil 
        action under paragraph (1), nothing in this subsection may be 
        construed to prevent the attorney general of a State from 
        exercising the powers conferred on such attorney general by the 
        laws of such State to conduct investigations, administer oaths 
        or affirmations, or compel the attendance of witnesses or the

                State to do so, except for any private person on behalf 
                of such State, may bring a civil action under paragraph 
                (1), subject to the same requirements and limitations 
                that apply under this subsection to civil actions 
                brought by attorneys general.
                    (B) Savings provision.--Nothing in this subsection 
                may be construed to prohibit an authorized official of 
                a State from initiating or continuing any proceeding in 
                a court of such State for a violation of any civil or 
                criminal law of such State.

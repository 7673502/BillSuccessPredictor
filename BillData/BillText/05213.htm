        substance abuse disorder.
            (3) Such veterans may be at a greater risk for suicide.
            (4) Veterans released from incarceration have specialized

SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE DOCUMENTATION OF INCARCERATED 
              VETERANS.

    (a) Establishment.--The Attorney General, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall carry out a pilot program to 
provide grants and technical assistance to State prisons and local 
jails to improve documentation of whether inmates of such institutions 
are veterans.
    (b) Purpose.--The purposes of the pilot program are the following:
            (1) To assist the Secretary in providing benefits to 
        incarcerated veterans under laws administered by the Secretary.
            (2) To assist veterans affairs offices of States in 
        providing benefits to incarcerated veterans under laws 
        administered by such offices.
            (3) To increase the number of veterans involved in the 
        criminal justice system whose cases are diverted to veterans 
        treatment courts.
    (c) Priority.--In selecting grant recipients under the pilot 
program, the Attorney General shall give priority to State prisons and 
local jails located in--
            (1) States that contain the greatest populations of 
        veterans per capita;
            (2) States with the highest rates of veterans living in 
        poverty; and
            (3) jurisdictions that contain a veterans treatment court 
        or veterans diversion program.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``veterans treatment 
court'' and ``veterans diversion program'' mean a State or local court 
that is participating in the veterans treatment court program (as 
defined in section 2991(i)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe 
Streets Act of 1968; 34 U.S.C. 10651(i)(1)).

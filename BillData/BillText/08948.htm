   To reauthorize the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Runaway and Homeless Youth and 
Trafficking Prevention Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Section 302 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (34 U.S.C. 11201) 
is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 302. FINDINGS.

    ``The Congress finds that--
            ``(1) youth who have become homeless or who leave and 
        remain away from home without parental permission are at risk 
        of developing, and have a disproportionate share of, trauma, 
        substance use disorders, and serious health, behavioral, 
        social, and emotional challenges because they lack sufficient 
        resources to obtain care and may live on the street for 
        extended periods of time, thereby endangering themselves;
            ``(2) many such young people, because of their age and 
        situation, are urgently in need of temporary shelter and 
        services, including services that consider their age, gender, 
        and social and developmental needs, are culturally and 
        linguistically appropriate, and acknowledge the environment of 
        youth seeking these services;
            ``(3) research has documented the fluid experiences of 
        homelessness of youth, where many youth experience 2 or more 
        different types of homelessness, including couch surfing, 
        living in motels, and staying on the streets;
            ``(4) research has documented that persons who are members 
        of historically marginalized and underserved communities of 
        color, LGBTQ youth, youth who do not complete high school or 
        achieve a high school equivalency, youth involved in the child 
        welfare system, youth who have been involved with the criminal 
        justice system, and pregnant and parenting youth are most 
        likely to experience homelessness in the United States while 
        unaccompanied by a parent or adult;
            ``(5) services to such young people should be developed and 
        provided using a positive youth development approach that 
        ensures a young person a sense of--
                    ``(A) safety and structure;
                    ``(B) belonging and membership;
                    ``(C) self-worth, empowerment, voice, and choice;
                    ``(D) independence and control over one's life; and
                    ``(E) closeness in interpersonal relationships;
            ``(6) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it 
        is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an 
        accurate national reporting system to report the prevalence of 
        youth homelessness, and to assist in the development of an 
        effective system of care (including prevention services and 
        aftercare services, short-term housing with services, extended 
        housing with supportive services, and street outreach services) 
        outside the welfare system and the law enforcement system, in 
        collaboration with public assistance systems, the education 
        system, and the child welfare system;
            ``(7) to make a successful transition to adulthood, youth 
        who run away, youth experiencing homelessness, and youth living 
        in the street need a safe and stable place to live, connections 
        to caring adults, and opportunities to complete high school or 
        earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain 
        employment;
            ``(8) improved coordination and collaboration at the 
        Federal level between programs that serve runaway and homeless 
        youth are necessary for the development of a long-term strategy 
        for responding to the needs of this population;
            ``(9) runaway and homeless youth are at a high risk of 
        substance use disorders and becoming victims of sexual 
        exploitation and trafficking;
            ``(10) since research has shown that the prevalence of 
        homelessness among youth is similar in rural and urban 
        communities, runaway and homeless youth programs, such as those 
        funded under this title, are integral services that every 
        community should provide, regardless of the size of the 
        community; and
            ``(11) runaway and homeless youth programs, such as those 
        funded under this title, are expert adolescent service 
        providers and integral community partners for the child welfare 
        and juvenile justice systems as many youth exit these systems 
        to homelessness.''.

SEC. 3. BASIC CENTER GRANT PROGRAM.

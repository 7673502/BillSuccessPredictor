            (1) In general.--The amendments made by this section shall 
        apply to taxable years ending after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, except that only periods after the date that is 
        270 days after the date of the enactment of this Act shall be 
        taken into account in determining whether the requirement of 
        section 501(s) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added 
        by this section) is met with respect to any taxable year.
            (2) 1-year grace period under certain circumstances.--In 
        the case of any organization that, after intensive due 
        diligence, is unaware of the failure to satisfy the requirement 
        of such section 501(s), paragraph (1) shall be applied by 
        substituting ``1 year'' for ``270 days''.
    (c) Public Report.--Not later than 360 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of the 
Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate) shall publicly release a report 
describing the patterns of United States outbound investment in China, 
including such investment by organizations described in section 
501(s)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by this 
section). Such report shall detail the sectoral breadkown of such 
investments.

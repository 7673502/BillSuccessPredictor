To revise the standards for eligibility for community development block 
        grant disaster recovery grants, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DISASTER RECOVERY GRANTS.

    In making any determination of whether any ZIP Code is a most 
impacted and distressed area for purposes of eligibility for a formula 
allocation with amounts made available under title I of the Housing and 
Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) for disaster 
recovery, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may not 
establish a minimum threshold dollar amount relating to serious unmet 
housing need for an area to be considered as having suffered sufficient 
concentrated damages, but shall consider any ZIP Code for which the 
median household income is less than 75 percent of the national median 
household income as having suffered such sufficient concentrated 
damages.

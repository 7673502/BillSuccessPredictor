    (b) Processing Previously Denied Applications.--If a service and

(title III of division N of Public Law 116-260), as added by subsection 
(a), was denied a grant under such section before the date of enactment 
of this Act due to lack of eligibility but, as a result of the 
amendments made by subsection (a), is eligible for a grant under such 
section, the Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall 
reconsider and process the application of the service and support 
company.
    (c) Regulations.--Not later than 30 days after the date of

Administration shall issue regulations to carry out this Act and the 
amendments made by this Act without regard to the notice requirements 
under section 553(b) of title 5, United States Code.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the

        business is to provide services and support to the live events 
        industry remain eligible for the program established under 
        section 324 of the Economic Aid to Hard Hit Small Businesses, 
        Nonprofits, and Venues Act (title III of division N of Public 
        Law 116-260); and
            (2) distribute funds appropriated for the program described 
        in paragraph (1) not later than 120 days after the date of

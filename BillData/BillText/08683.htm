                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for the establishment of United States embassies in the 
   Republic of Vanuatu, the Republic of Kiribati, and the Kingdom of 
                     Tonga, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pacific Islands Embassies Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Pacific Islands are vital to United States national 
        security and national interests in the Indo-Pacific region and 
        globally.
            (2) The Pacific Islands region spans 15 percent of the 
        world's surface area and controls access to open waters in the 
        Central Pacific, sea lanes to the Western Hemisphere, supply 
        lines to United States forward-deployed forces in East Asia, 
        and economically important fisheries.
            (3) The Pacific Islands region is home to the State of 
        Hawaii, 11 United States territories, United States Naval Base 
        Guam, and United States Andersen Air Force Base.
            (4) Pacific Island countries cooperate with the United 
        States and United States partners on maritime security and 
        efforts to stop illegal, unreported, and destructive fishing.
            (5) The Pacific Islands are rich in biodiversity and on the 
        frontlines of sea level rise, worsening tropical storms, and 
        coral reef loss associated with climate change.
            (6) The People's Republic of China (PRC) seeks to increase 
        its influence in the Pacific Islands region, including through 
        infrastructure development under the PRC's Belt and Road 
        Initiative and its new security agreement with the Solomon 
        Islands.
            (7) The United States Embassy in Papua New Guinea manages 
        the diplomatic affairs of the United States to the Republic of 
        Vanuatu, and the United States Embassy in Fiji manages the 
        diplomatic affairs of the United States to the Republic of 
        Kiribati and the Kingdom of Tonga.
            (8) The United States requires a physical diplomatic 
        presence in the Republic of Vanuatu, the Republic of Kiribati, 
        and the Kingdom of Tonga, to ensure the physical and operation 
        security of our efforts in those countries to deepen relations, 
        protect United States national security, and pursue United 
        States national interests.
            (9) Increasing the number of United States embassies 
        dedicated solely to a Pacific Island country demonstrates the 
        United States' ongoing commitment to the region and to the 
        Pacific Island countries.

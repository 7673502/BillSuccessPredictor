                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit certain discrimination against athletes on the basis of sex 
   by intercollegiate athletic associations, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Play for Women Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) 50 years ago, Congress passed title IX of the Education 
        Amendments of 1972 (referred to in this section as ``title 
        IX''), helping to transform participation in and support for 
        women's sports by barring discrimination on the basis of sex in 
        all schools that receive Federal funding, including in their 
        athletic programs.
            (2) Since the passage of title IX, millions more women and 
        girls have had the opportunity to compete in interscholastic 
        athletics. At the high school level, athletic participation 
        opportunities have increased from nearly 300,000 in 1972 to 
        more than 3,400,000 in 2019. At the collegiate level, 
        opportunities have increased from nearly 30,000 in 1972 to 
        215,000 in 2020 on teams sponsored by institutions who are 
        members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
        (referred to in this section as the ``NCAA'').
            (3) Despite progress, women and girls still face unequal 
        opportunities. At the high school level, girls have over 
        1,000,000 fewer athletic opportunities than boys, with schools 
        providing girls with 43 percent of all athletic opportunities 
        while girls represent nearly half of all students. At the 
        collegiate level, colleges would need to provide women with an 
        additional 148,000 sports opportunities to match the same ratio 
        of sports opportunities per student as is offered to men.
            (4) Girls of color are often most impacted by inequitable 
        opportunities. At high schools predominantly attended by White 
        students, girls have 82 percent of the opportunities that boys 
        have to play sports, while at high schools predominantly 
        attended by students of color, girls have only 67 percent of 
        the opportunities that boys have to play sports.
            (5) The magnitude of current gaps in intercollegiate 
        participation opportunities is likely undercounted, as 
        investigations of intercollegiate athletics data have found 
        that the majority of NCAA member institutions inflate the 
        number of women participating in sports by double- and triple-
        counting women athletes who participate in more than one sport 
        more often than the institutions double- and triple-count their 
        male counterparts, counting male practice players on women's 
        teams as women athletes, and packing women's teams with extra 
        players who never end up competing.
            (6) Women and girls in sports also face unequal treatment. 
        They are frequently provided worse facilities, equipment, and 
        uniforms than men and boys, and they receive less financial 
        support and publicity from their schools, as women receive 
        $240,000,000 less than men in athletic-based scholarships 
        annually. For every dollar colleges spend on recruiting, 
        travel, and equipment for men's sports, they spend 58 cents, 62 
        cents, and 73 cents, respectively, for women's sports.
            (7) Amid ongoing inequitable treatment, athletes and 
        athletics-related staff too often are unaware of the rights and 
        obligations that are described in or come from title IX. In 
        surveys of children and their parents, the majority report not 
        knowing what title IX is. A study conducted by the Government 
        Accountability Office in 2017 found that the majority of high 
        school athletic administrators were unaware of who their title 
        IX coordinator was or felt unsupported by their title IX 
        coordinator. In collegiate sports, the majority of coaches 
        report that they never received formal training about title IX 
        as part of the preparation for their jobs.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) address inequitable and discriminatory treatment of 
        women and girls in sports in elementary and secondary schools, 
        as well as institutions of higher education; and
            (2) improve the collection and transparency of data 
        pertaining to participation in and support for women's and 
        girls' sports at schools receiving Federal financial 
        assistance.

SEC. 4. DISCRIMINATION BY INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC ASSOCIATIONS.

    (a) In General.--No intercollegiate athletic association shall, on 
the basis of sex, subject any athlete to discrimination with respect to 
intercollegiate athletics, including discrimination through--

            (2) the sports required for association membership or the 
        sports sponsored for association competitions or supported with

        association competitions or championships;
            (4) the provision or arrangement for the provision of goods 
        or services (including benefits) for association competitions 
        or championships; or
            (5) the distribution of revenues or other benefits to 
        association members or institutions under the authority of the 
        association.
    (b) Private Right of Action.--A covered institution of higher 
education that is a member of or under the authority of an 
intercollegiate athletic association, or an individual who applies to 
participate, participates, or previously participated in 
intercollegiate athletics, at a covered institution of higher education 
that is a member of or under the authority of an intercollegiate 
athletic association, may bring an action in any Federal or State court 
of competent jurisdiction against the intercollegiate athletic 
association to remedy a violation of this section. The court may award 
such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate for such a 
violation. The legal relief may include compensatory damages for 
emotional distress, humiliation, or pain and suffering.
    (c) Training.--Each intercollegiate athletic association shall 
ensure that each employee of the association receives, at least once 
per year, training on the provisions of this section, including the 
rights delineated under this section and the procedures for bringing 
actions under this section.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Covered institution of higher education.--The term 
        ``covered institution of higher education'' means an entity 
        described in section 908(2)(A) of the Education Amendments of

            (2) Intercollegiate athletic association.--The term 
        ``intercollegiate athletic association'' means any conference,

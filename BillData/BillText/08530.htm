        more than 6 times the national average of such allotments for 
        all the States for such fiscal year and that requires political 
        subdivisions within the State to contribute funds towards 
        medical assistance or other expenditures under the State plan 
        under this title (or under a waiver of such plan) for a quarter 
        in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2025), in 
        determining the amount that is payable to the State for 
        expenditures in such quarter under subsection (a)(1), other 
        than contributions described in paragraph (2), the amount of 
        such expenditures shall be reduced by the applicable percentage 
        described in paragraph (3), with respect to such fiscal year, 
        of the amount that political subdivisions in the State are 
        required to contribute under the plan.
            ``(2) Excepted contributions.--The contributions described 
        in this paragraph for a fiscal year are the following:

                        5,000,000, as estimated by the Bureau of the 
                        Census; and

                        residents.
                    ``(B) Contributions required by a State from a 
                political subdivision for administrative expenses if

                subdivision without reimbursement from the State as of 
                January 1, 2022.
            ``(3) Applicable percentage.--For purposes of paragraph

        not receive the increase described in the second sentence of 
        paragraph (1) to the enhanced FMAP for such State, with respect 
        to a quarter that occurs during such period, if--

                State under the State child health plan (or a waiver of 
                such plan) during such quarter, with respect to an 
                individual enrolled under such plan (or waiver), 
                exceeds the amount of such premium as of January 1, 
                2020;
                    ``(B) the State fails to provide that an individual 
                who is enrolled for benefits under such plan (or 
                waiver) as of the date of enactment of this paragraph 
                or enrolls for benefits under such plan (or waiver) 
                during the period beginning on such date of enactment 
                and ending on the last day of the month in which the 
                emergency period defined in paragraph (1)(B) of section 
                1135(g) ends shall be treated as eligible for such 
                benefits through the end of the month in which such 
                emergency period ends unless the individual requests a 
                voluntary termination of eligibility or the individual 
                ceases to be a resident of the State;
                    ``(C) the State does not provide coverage under 
                such plan (or waiver), without the imposition of cost 
                sharing, during such quarter for any testing services 
                and treatments for COVID-19, including vaccines, 
                specialized equipment, and therapies;

                State child health plan prior to the provision of child 
                health assistance to a targeted low-income child; or
                    ``(E) the State fails to take active measures (as 
                determined by the Secretary) to identify and re-enroll 
                children who are eligible for child health assistance 
                under the State plan and who were previously enrolled 
                in such plan.''.

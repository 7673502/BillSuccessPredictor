                                 A BILL


 
To authorize assistance to train and retain obstetrician-gynecologists 
and sub-specialists in urogynecology and to help improve the quality of 
    care to meet the health care needs of women in least developed 
                   countries, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Physician Education for Fistula 
Treatment Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Obstetric fistula, an abnormal opening between a 
        woman's genital tract and her urinary tract or rectum, is a 
        devastating childbirth injury caused by prolonged, obstructed 
        labor in the absence of timely and quality medical care.
            (2) Worldwide, an estimated 500,000 women and girls live 
        with obstetric fistula with thousands more occurring annually. 
        It occurs disproportionately among impoverished, vulnerable, 
        and marginalized girls and women.
            (3) Women who experience an obstetric fistula suffer life-
        shattering consequences including chronic incontinence, shame, 
        social isolation, poverty, and physical, mental, and emotional 
        health problems.
            (4) Obstetric fistula is a violation of human rights and an 
        indicator of the failure of health systems to deliver 
        universally accessible, timely, and quality health care to 
        women and girls who need it.
            (5) Obstetric fistula is preventable. Universal health 
        coverage and universal access to quality care are essential in 
        ending preventable maternal and newborn deaths and 
        disabilities, including fistula. Skilled health personnel at 
        birth, emergency obstetric and newborn care, and universal 
        access to modern contraception are the most effective 
        interventions to prevent maternal mortality and fistula.
            (6) Safeguarding the rights and dignity of women and girls 
        and addressing underlying gender and socioeconomic inequalities 
        and discrimination which drive obstetric fistula are equally 
        important to end the condition.
            (7) In 2018 and 2020, the United Nations General Assembly 
        resolutions on fistula were adopted, calling for ``Ending 
        fistula within a decade''. This represents a turning point in 
        the global fight to eliminate fistula, as it brings the global 
        objective and timeline for ending fistula into alignment with 
        achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)/Agenda 2030. 
        The resolutions also call for an increased focus on social 
        determinants to tackle the root causes of fistula.
            (8) Obstetric fistula can be surgically treated. The impact 
        of an obstetric fistula-repair surgery is immediate and women 
        can be reintegrated into society. There is however a high unmet 
        need for treatment and social reintegration of fistula 
        survivors.
            (9) The Covid-19 pandemic caused overloaded health systems 
        and reallocation of human and financial resources with 
        disruptions to services resulting in an undermining of the 
        sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls. 
        In 2020, fistula repairs were widely halted or slowed down due 
        to Covid-19, as they were deemed non-urgent and unsafe during 
        the pandemic. This may result in an increased backlog of 
        fistula cases.
            (10) The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)-led global 
        Campaign to End Fistula, is a key contributor to promoting the 
        rights, dignity, and well-being of women and girls. The 
        Campaign focuses on prevention, treatment, social 
        reintegration, and advocacy. Aimed at ``leaving no one behind'' 
        and ``reaching the furthest behind'', it contributes to 
        achieving the SDGs and has also helped restore overall health, 
        dignity, hope, and a sense of self-worth and agency to some of 
        the poorest, most marginalized women and girls worldwide 
        through its holistic, gender-sensitive, and rights-based 
        approach to policies and programs for the elimination of 
        obstetric fistula and several other maternal morbidities.
            (11) UNFPA has supported over 129,000 surgical repairs from 
        2003 through 2021. The Campaign to End Fistula and its partners 
        has made remarkable progress, but the needs remain great.
            (12) With 8 years to reach the global goal of ending 
        fistula by 2030, significantly intensified investment, efforts, 
        and partnerships at the international and national levels are 
        required.
            (13) The International Day to End Obstetric Fistula which 
        takes place on May 23, 2022, will be commemorated this year 
        with the theme: ``End Fistula Now: Invest in Quality 
        Healthcare, Empower Communities!'', calling for investments to 
        improve the quality of care and emphasizing the key role of 
        communities in addressing social, cultural, political, and 
        economic determinants that impact maternal health and sexual 
        reproductive health, and reproductive rights.

              PHYSICIANS IN LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

    (a) In General.--The President, acting through the Director of the 
John E. Fogarty International Center for Advanced Study in the Health 
Sciences, shall establish a comprehensive, integrated, 10-year strategy 
to address the shortage of physicians in least developed countries.
    (b) Elements.--Such strategy shall maintain sufficient flexibility 
and remain responsive to the needs of women afflicted with childbirth-
related injuries and shall include the following:
            (1) A plan for implementation and coordination of programs 
        and activities under this Act, including grants and contracts 
        for prevention, treatment, and monitoring of childbirth-related 
        injuries.
            (2) Specific objectives, multi-sector approaches, and 
        specific strategies to treat women who suffer from childbirth-
        related injuries and to prevent further occurrences of 
        childbirth-related injuries.
            (3) Assignment of priorities for relevant executive branch 
        agencies.
            (4) Public health and health care delivery system research 
        on the prevention, repair, and rehabilitation of childbirth-
        related injuries.
            (5) Social science research in fields such as anthropology, 
        sociology, and related fields to monitor and evaluate the 
        underlying social and economic factors that contribute to 
        childbirth-related injuries.
            (6) Development, implementation, and evaluation of 
        evidence-based systems of care connecting maternity care 
        facilities with local care delivery and community education 
        programs. Such systems of care should promote rapid and long-
        term prevention of childbirth-related injuries, including--
                    (A) culturally appropriate childbirth education, 
                preparation, and planning; and
                    (B) access to obstetrician-gynecologists (OB-GYNs),

            (8) Priorities for the distribution of resources based on 
        factors such as the size and demographics of the population 
        suffering from childbirth-related injuries, the needs of that 
        population, and the existing infrastructure or funding levels 
        that may exist to treat and prevent childbirth-related 
        injuries, including obstetric fistula.
            (9) A plan for institutional capacity-building of 
        partnerships to strengthen universities, research centers, 
        health-profession training programs, and government institutes 
        to build the in-country capacity needed to eradicate 
        childbirth-related injuries in least developed countries.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment

                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                           December 21, 2022

  Mr. Beyer introduced the following bill; which was referred to the 
 Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on 
   Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the 
  Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall 
           within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To cap the emissions of greenhouse gases through a requirement to 
 purchase carbon permits, to distribute the proceeds of such purchases 
            to eligible individuals, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy Climate and Family Security 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
        continue to rise.
            (2) The warming of our planet has led to more frequent, 
        dangerous and expensive extreme weather events, including heat 
        waves, storms, fires, droughts, floods and tornadoes.
            (3) A 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
        Change (IPCC) recommends that serious efforts be made to limit 
        global warming to 1.5 C, which would require that 
        CO&lt;INF&gt;2&lt;/INF&gt; emissions fall by 45 percent below 2010 levels 
        by 2030, reaching net zero by the middle of this century.
            (4) The atmosphere is a common resource that belongs 
        equally to all.
            (5) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way 
        that supports vibrant economic growth and a thriving middle 
        class.
            (6) Stabilizing the climate can and must be done in a way 
        that supports environmental justice by reducing pollution 
        affecting communities that have suffered disproportionately 
        from hazards arising from the extraction and combustion of 
        fossil fuels and supports community right-to-know reporting on 
        emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
            (7) Legislation to address climate change and accelerate 
        the transition to a clean energy economy must be fair, 
        transparent and built to last.

Secretary a quantity of carbon permits at least as great as the number 
of metric tons of carbon dioxide that the Secretary, in consultation 
with the Administrator, determines would be emitted by the combustion 
of covered fuels with respect to which the covered entity made the 
first sale in United States markets during the previous calendar year.
    ``(b) Use Treated as Sale.--For purposes of subsection (a), 
consumption for an emitting use by the covered entity of covered fuels 
produced by the covered entity shall be treated as a first sale.

surrender, by the deadline described in section 9904, one or more of

surrender permits in order to meet this past due obligation and shall 
be liable for payment to the Secretary of a penalty in the amount 
described in subsection (b).

subsection (a) shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying--

        failed to surrender by the deadline, by
            ``(2) 3 times the fair market value of carbon permits 
        issued for emissions occurring in the calendar year for which 
        the carbon permits were due.
    ``(c) Timing.--A penalty required under this section shall be 
immediately due and payable to the Secretary, without demand, in 
accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary, which shall 
be issued not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this 
subtitle.

covered entity under this section shall not diminish the liability of 
the covered entity for any fine, penalty, or assessment against the 
covered entity for the same violation under any other provision of law.
    ``(e) Penalty Not Deductible.--No deduction shall be allowed under 
subtitle A for a penalty paid under this section.

``SEC. 9906. TRACKING.

    ``The regulations promulgated under section 9902(e) shall include a

that shall specify all necessary procedures and requirements for an 
orderly and competitive functioning of the carbon permit system. Such 
regulations shall provide for appropriate publication of the 
information in the system on the Internet.

``SEC. 9907. BANKING.

    ``(a) Banking.--A carbon permit may be used to meet the compliance 
obligation requirements of section 9904 for emissions only in the 
permit's vintage year, the year prior, or the year following. At least 
80 percent of permits used by an entity to meet its compliance 
obligation for a year must be of that year's vintage. The Secretary 
shall have the authority to establish stricter requirements for the 
percentage of the compliance obligation for a year that must be met 
with permits of that year's vintage, and to establish penalties for 
failure to comply.
    ``(b) Expiration.--A carbon permit shall expire when--
            ``(1) it is surrendered to the Secretary under section 
        9904,
            ``(2) it has been held by a covered entity and has not been 
        surrendered to the Secretary under section 9904 within 18 
        months after the end of its vintage year, or
            ``(3) the Secretary determines by regulation that 
        expiration is necessary to ensure the authenticity and 
        integrity of carbon permits or the carbon permit tracking 
        system.

``SEC. 9908. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

    ``(a) In General.--This chapter shall be implemented to the extent 
practicable to ensure that reductions in carbon emissions are 
accompanied by commensurate reductions in emissions of co-pollutants 
from fossil fuel combustion that impact frontline communities.
    ``(b) Report on Air Quality Methods Development.--Not later than 1 
year after the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator 
shall submit to Congress a report detailing efforts to increase air 
quality monitoring deployment and technical assistance at the Federal, 
State, local, and tribal level.
    ``(c) Air Quality Monitoring in Frontline Communities.--The 
Administrator (or the Administrator's delegate) is authorized to 
provide for trends monitoring of ambient air quality in frontline 
communities and monitoring of co-pollutant emissions from sources 
located in or near such communities that impact their pollution burden. 
Not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of this section, 
any information from such monitors shall be recorded and reported at 
the level of monitor and pollutant, and made available to the public to 
support effective community participation in the making of 
environmental policies.
    ``(d) Environmental Justice Guarantee.--In cases where co-pollutant 
emissions impacting frontline communities have not declined at a rate 
equal to the carbon dioxide emissions targets established in section 
9902(b)(2), the Administrator is authorized to implement or promulgate 
additional regulatory measures to ensure such reductions.
    ``(e) Environmental Justice Review.--Not later than 4 years after 
the date of enactment of this section, and annually thereafter, the

communities, evaluate the effects of the enactment of this chapter on 
environmental justice, and recommend further corrective measures if 
needed.

otherwise appropriated, there shall be appropriated such sums as are 
necessary to carry out the purposes of this section, to remain 
available until expended.

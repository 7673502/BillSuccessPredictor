To amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for the treatment of 
      notice of presumed risk issued by the Military Aviation and 
      Installation Assurance Clearinghouse for review of mission 
                             obstructions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF NOTICE OF PRESUMED RISK ISSUED BY MILITARY 
              AVIATION AND INSTALLATION ASSURANCE CLEARINGHOUSE FOR 
              REVIEW OF MISSION OBSTRUCTIONS.

    Subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) of subsection (C) of section 183a 
of title 10, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:
    ``(B) A notice of presumed risk issued pursuant to subparagraph (A) 
is a preliminary assessment only and is not a finding of unacceptable 
risk under subsection (e). A discussion of mitigation actions could 
resolve the concerns identified by the Department in the preliminary 
assessment in favor of the applicant.''.

date amends or repeals a source provision, that law is deemed to amend 
or repeal, as the case may be, the corresponding restated provision. If

provision or a provision of this Act, that law supersedes the restated 
provision or provision of this Act to the extent of the inconsistency.

offense committed under a source provision is deemed to have been taken 
or committed under the corresponding restated provision.

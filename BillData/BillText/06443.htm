                                 A BILL


 
     To accelerate deployment by Taiwan of the asymmetric defense 
capabilities required to deter or, if necessary, defeat an invasion of 
   Taiwan by the People's Republic of China, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Arm Taiwan Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has warned that the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China may conclude that 
        it can successfully invade and seize control of Taiwan in the 
        latter half of the 2020s.
            (2) In October 2021, the Minister of National Defense of 
        Taiwan, Chiu Kuo-cheng, echoed these warnings when he stated 
        that the People's Republic of China--
                    (A) ``is capable now'' of invading Taiwan; and
                    (B) will have ``lowered the costs and losses'' 
                associated with invading Taiwan ``to a minimum'' after 
                2025.
            (3) If the People's Republic of China were to invade and 
        seize control of Taiwan, it would deal a severe blow to United 
        States interests by--
                    (A) destroying one of the world's leading 
                democracies;
                    (B) casting doubt on the ability and resolve of the 
                United States to uphold its security commitments;
                    (C) incentivizing other countries in the Indo-
                Pacific region to bandwagon with the People's Republic 
                of China; and
                    (D) facilitating the formation of a regional order 
                dominated by the People's Republic of China in which 
                the Government of the People's Republic of China may--
                            (i) regulate or otherwise limit the ability 
                        of individuals in the United States to trade in 
                        the Indo-Pacific region, which would have dire 
                        effects on the livelihoods and freedoms of such 
                        individuals; and
                            (ii) use the Indo-Pacific region as a 
                        secure base from which to project military 
                        power into other regions, including the Western 
                        Hemisphere.
            (4) Taiwan's proximity to the People's Republic of China, 
        coupled with investments by the People's Republic of China in 
        capabilities designed to delay intervention by the United 
        States Armed Forces in support of Taiwan, means that Taiwan may 
        be forced to delay, degrade, and deny an invasion by the 
        People's Republic of China with limited support from the United 
        States Armed Forces for the initial days, weeks, or months of 
        such an invasion.
            (5) If Taiwan is unable to delay, degrade, and deny an 
        invasion by the People's Republic of China with limited support 
        from the United States Armed Forces, especially in the initial 
        period of war, then the People's Republic of China may conclude 
        that it is, or may actually be, capable of--
                    (A) invading and seizing control of Taiwan before 
                the United States or any other partner country of 
                Taiwan is able to respond effectively, thereby 
                achieving a fait accompli; and
                    (B) potentially rendering any attempt by the United 
                States or any other partner country of Taiwan to 
                reverse territorial gains by the People's Republic of 
                China prohibitively difficult, costly, or both.
            (6) To defend itself effectively, especially in the initial 
        period of war, it is imperative that Taiwan accelerate 
        deployment of cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense 
        capabilities, including mobile coastal and air defenses, naval 
        mines, missile boats, man-portable anti-armor weapons, civil 
        defense forces, and their enablers.
            (7) The deployment of such asymmetric defense capabilities 
        by Taiwan would not only improve the ability of Taiwan to 
        defend itself, but also reduce operational risk to members of 
        the United States Armed Forces under a Taiwan contingency.
            (8) The President of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-Wen, has--
                    (A) vowed to bolster the national defense of Taiwan 
                and demonstrate Taiwan's determination to defend itself 
                so as to ensure that Taiwan will not be forced to take 
                the path that the People's Republic of China has laid 
                out for Taiwan; and
                    (B) advocated the deployment of asymmetric defense 
                capabilities.
            (9) The Government of Taiwan has begun taking steps to 
        improve Taiwan's defenses, including by increasing Taiwan's 
        defense budget and through Taiwan's new proposed special 
        defense budget, but far more is needed, and quickly, to ensure 
        that Taiwan is able to maintain a sufficient self-defense 
        capability.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the threat of an invasion of Taiwan by the People's 
        Republic of China is increasing rapidly and expected to reach 
        especially dangerous levels by the latter half of the 2020s;
            (2) the United States has a strong interest in preventing 
        the People's Republic of China from invading and seizing 
        control of Taiwan, especially by ensuring that Taiwan is able 
        to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability;
            (3) the United States should establish a security 
        assistance initiative so as to accelerate, to the greatest 
        extent possible, Taiwan's deployment of cost-effective and 
        resilient asymmetric defense capabilities;
            (4) the United States should provide such assistance on the 
        condition that Taiwan--
                    (A) matches investments by the United States in its 
                asymmetric defense capabilities;
                    (B) increases its defense spending to a level 
                commensurate with the threat it faces;
                    (C) prioritizes acquiring cost-effective and 
                resilient asymmetric defense capabilities as rapidly as 
                possible, including from foreign suppliers, if 
                necessary; and
                    (D) demonstrates progress on defense reforms 
                required to maximize the effectiveness of its 
                asymmetric defenses, with special regard to Taiwan's 
                reserve forces; and
            (5) in the course of executing such a security assistance 
        initiative, the United States should--
                    (A) seek to co-produce or co-develop cost-effective 
                and resilient asymmetric defense capabilities with 
                suppliers in Taiwan, including by providing incentives 
                to that effect, so long as those suppliers can produce 
                such capabilities at a reasonable cost, in the 
                quantities required, as rapidly, and to the same 
                quality and technical standards as suppliers in the 
                United States or other countries; and
                    (B) encourage other countries, particularly United 
                States allies and partners, to sell, lease, or 
                otherwise provide appropriate asymmetric defense 
                capabilities to Taiwan so as to facilitate Taiwan's 
                rapid deployment of the asymmetric defense capabilities 
                required to deter or, if necessary, defeat an invasion 
                by the People's Republic of China.

                defense capabilities in the applicable fiscal year and 
                upheld its commitment to spend an equivalent amount as 
                the United States in the preceding fiscal year on 
                asymmetric defense capabilities to be deployed by 
                Taiwan;
                    (B) to spending not less than two and a half 
                percent of Taiwan's national gross domestic product on 
                defense on an annual basis by the end of fiscal year 
                2025, and not less than three percent of Taiwan's

                the preceding fiscal year;
                    (C) to acquiring asymmetric defense capabilities as 
                rapidly as possible, including from suppliers in the 
                United States or other countries, if the Secretary of 
                Defense determines that such suppliers will be able to 
                provide such capabilities at reasonable cost, in 
                sufficient quantities, of sufficient quality and 
                technical standards, and more rapidly than suppliers in 
                Taiwan, and upheld its commitment to acquire asymmetric 
                defense capabilities as rapidly as possible in the 
                preceding fiscal year; and
                    (D) to undertaking the defense reforms required to

                against an invasion by the People's Republic of China, 
                including by improving the organization, mobilization, 
                and training of the reserve forces and other military 
                personnel of Taiwan, and demonstrated progress on such 
                reforms in the preceding fiscal year.

    (h) Termination of Authority.--Assistance may not be provided under 
this section after September 30, 2027.

SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON CONVENTIONAL ARMS SALES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) historically, the Government of Taiwan has prioritized 
        the acquisition of conventional weapons that would be of 
        limited utility in deterring or defeating an invasion by the 
        People's Republic of China at the expense of the timely 
        acquisition of cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense 
        capabilities;
            (2) the United States Government has often shared 
        responsibility for the misguided prioritization of defense 
        acquisitions described in paragraph (1) by approving sales of 
        conventional weapons to Taiwan, despite knowledge that such 
        sales would do little to enhance, and may even undermine, the 
        ability of Taiwan to deter or defeat an invasion by the 
        People's Republic of China;
            (3) the misguided prioritization of defense acquisitions 
        described in paragraph (1) has not only undermined the ability 
        of Taiwan to deter or defeat an invasion by the People's 
        Republic of China, but has also placed at greater risk of death 
        or injury members of the United States Armed Forces who may 
        come under attack or be asked to come to the aid of Taiwan to 
        repel such an invasion; and
            (4) any future sales, leases, or other provision of 
        conventional weaponry to Taiwan by the United States should be 
        conditioned on meaningful progress by the Government of Taiwan 
        on the acquisition of appropriate asymmetric defense

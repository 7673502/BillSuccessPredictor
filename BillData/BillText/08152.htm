                to a specific request from a covered entity that meets 
                the requirements of subparagraph (B).
                    (B) Request requirements.--The requirements of this

                        standalone disclosure made through the primary 
                        medium used to offer the covered entity's 
                        product or service, or only if the product or 
                        service is not offered in a medium that permits 
                        the making of the request under this paragraph, 
                        another medium regularly used in conjunction 
                        with the covered entity's product or service.

                        the processing purpose for which the 
                        individual's consent is sought and--
                                    (I) clearly states the specific 
                                categories of covered data that the 
                                covered entity shall collect, process, 
                                and transfer necessary to effectuate 
                                the processing purpose; and
                                    (II) includes a prominent heading 
                                and is written in easy-to-understand 
                                language that would enable a reasonable 
                                individual to identify and understand 
                                the processing purpose for which 
                                consent is sought and the covered data 
                                to be collected, processed, or 
                                transferred by the covered entity for 
                                such processing purpose.
                            (iii) The request clearly explains the 
                        individual's applicable rights related to 
                        consent.
                            (iv) The request is made in a manner 
                        reasonably accessible to and usable by 
                        individuals with disabilities.
                            (v) The request is made available to the 
                        individual in each covered language in which 
                        the covered entity provides a product or 
                        service for which authorization is sought.
                            (vi) The option to refuse consent shall be 
                        at least as prominent as the option to accept, 
                        and the option to refuse consent shall take the 
                        same number of steps or fewer as the option to 
                        accept.

                        express consent for a different processing 
                        purpose than that for which affirmative express 
                        consent was obtained shall require affirmative 
                        express consent for the subsequent processing 
                        purpose.
                    (C) Express consent required.--A covered entity may 
                not infer that an individual has provided affirmative 
                express consent to an act or practice from the inaction 
                of the individual or the individual's continued use of

                entity may not obtain or attempt to obtain the

            (4) To fulfill a product or service warranty.
            (5) To prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to a

        defined as network security and physical security and life 
        safety, including an intrusion or trespass, medical alerts, 
        fire alarms, and access control security.
            (6) To prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to 
        fraud, harassment, or illegal activity. For purposes of this 
        paragraph, the term ``illegal activity'' means a violation of a

        misdemeanor that can directly harm.
            (7) To comply with a legal obligation imposed by Federal,

                    (ii) adheres to all relevant laws and regulations 
                governing such research, including regulations for the 
                protection of human subjects, or is excluded from

        covered entities ensure the privacy of affected users and the 
        security of covered data, particularly as data is being 
        transferred to and stored by researchers. Such guidelines 
        should consider risks as they pertain to projects using covered 
        data with special considerations for projects that are exempt 
        under part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations (or any 
        successor regulation) or are excluded from the criteria for 
        institutional review board review.

        the individual's interactions with the covered entity.
            (12) To deliver a communication at the direction of an 
        individual between such individual and one or more individuals 
        or entities.
            (13) To transfer assets to a third party in the context of 
        a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or similar transaction when 
        the third party assumes control, in whole or in part, of the 
        covered entity's assets, only if the covered entity, in a 
        reasonable time prior to such transfer, provides each affected 
        individual with--
                    (A) a notice describing such transfer, including 
                the name of the entity or entities receiving the 
                individual's covered data and their privacy policies as 
                described in section 202; and
                    (B) a reasonable opportunity to withdraw any 
                previously given consents in accordance with the 
                requirements of affirmative express consent under this 
                Act related to the individual's covered data and a

        direction of a government entity, or a service provided to a 
        government entity by a covered entity, and only insofar as 
        authorized by statute, to prevent, detect, protect against or 
        respond to a public safety incident, including trespass, 
        natural disaster, or national security incident. This paragraph 
        does not permit, however, the transfer of covered data for 
        payment or other valuable consideration to a government entity.
            (16) With respect to covered data collected in accordance 
        with this Act, notwithstanding this exception, to process such 
        data as necessary to provide first party advertising or 
        marketing of products or services provided by the covered 
        entity for individuals who are not-covered minors.
            (17) With respect to covered data previously collected in 
        accordance with this Act, notwithstanding this exception and 
        provided such collection, processing, and transferring 
        otherwise complies with the requirements of this Act, including 
        section 204(c), to provide targeted advertising.

        whether the covered entity is a large data holder, nonprofit 
        organization, covered entity meeting the requirements of 
        section 209, third party, or third-party collecting entity;
            (2) the sensitivity of covered data collected, processed, 
        or transferred by the covered entity;
            (3) the volume of covered data collected, processed, or 
        transferred by the covered entity; and
            (4) the number of individuals and devices to which the 
        covered data collected, processed, or transferred by the 
        covered entity relates.
    (d) Deceptive Marketing of a Product or Service.--A covered entity 
or service provider may not engage in deceptive advertising or 
marketing with respect to a product or service offered to an 
individual.
    (e) Journalism.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit or 
diminish First Amendment freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution.

SEC. 102. LOYALTY DUTIES.

    Notwithstanding section 101 and unless an exception applies, with 
respect to covered data, a covered entity or service provider may not--
            (1) collect, process, or transfer a Social Security number, 
        except when necessary to facilitate an extension of credit, 
        authentication, fraud and identity fraud detection and 
        prevention, the payment or collection of taxes, the enforcement 
        of a contract between parties, or the prevention, 
        investigation, or prosecution of fraud or illegal activity, or 
        as otherwise required by Federal, State, or local law;
            (2) collect or process sensitive covered data, except where 
        such collection or processing is strictly necessary to provide 
        or maintain a specific product or service requested by the 
        individual to whom the covered data pertains, or is strictly 
        necessary to effect a purpose enumerated in paragraphs (1) 
        through (12) and (14) through (15) of section 101(b);
            (3) transfer an individual's sensitive covered data to a 
        third party, unless--
                    (A) the transfer is made pursuant to the 
                affirmative express consent of the individual;
                    (B) the transfer is necessary to comply with a 
                legal obligation imposed by Federal, State, Tribal, or 
                local law, or to establish, exercise, or defend legal 
                claims;
                    (C) the transfer is necessary to prevent an 
                individual from imminent injury where the covered 
                entity believes in good faith that the individual is at 
                risk of death, serious physical injury, or serious 
                health risk;

                government entity by a covered entity, and only insofar 
                as authorized by statute, the transfer is necessary to 
                prevent, detect, protect against or respond to a public 
                safety incident including trespass, natural disaster,

                permit, however, the transfer of covered data for 
                payment or other valuable consideration to a government 
                entity;
                    (E) in the case of the transfer of a password, the 
                transfer is necessary to use a designated password 
                manager or is to a covered entity for the exclusive 
                purpose of identifying passwords that are being re-used

                research in accordance with conditions of section 
                101(b)(10); or
                    (G) to transfer assets in the manner described in 
                paragraph (13) of section 101(b); or
            (4) in the case of a provider of broadcast television 
        service, cable service, satellite service, streaming media 
        service, or other video programming service described in

        covered minors (including, if applicable, with respect to a 
        covered entity that is not an entity meeting the requirements 
        of section 209, in a manner that considers the developmental 
        needs of different age ranges of covered minors) to result in 
        reasonably necessary and proportionate residual risk to covered 
        minors;
            (3) mitigate privacy risks, including substantial privacy 
        risks, related to the products and services of the covered

        provider and the information available to it; and
            (4) implement reasonable training and safeguards within the 
        covered entity and service provider to promote compliance with

        provider collects, processes, or transfers on behalf of the 
        covered entity and mitigate privacy risks, including

        available to it.
    (b) Factors to Consider.--The policies, practices, and procedures 
established by a covered entity and a service provider under subsection

        and the nature, scope, and complexity of the activities engaged 
        in by the covered entity or service provider, including whether 
        the covered entity or service provider is a large data holder, 
        nonprofit organization, entity meeting the requirements of 
        section 209, third party, or third-party collecting entity, 
        taking into account the role of the covered entity or service 
        provider and the information available to it;
            (2) the sensitivity of the covered data collected, 
        processed, or transferred by the covered entity or service 
        provider;
            (3) the volume of covered data collected, processed, or 
        transferred by the covered entity or service provider;
            (4) the number of individuals and devices to which the 
        covered data collected, processed, or transferred by the 
        covered entity or service provider relates; and
            (5) the cost of implementing such policies, practices, and 
        procedures in relation to the risks and nature of the covered 
        data.
    (c) Commission Guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue guidance as to what 
constitutes reasonable policies, practices, and procedures as required 
by this section. The Commission shall consider unique circumstances 
applicable to nonprofit organizations, to entities meeting the 
requirements of section 209, and to service providers.

of quality of goods or services.
    (b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) may be 
construed to--
            (1) prohibit the relation of the price of a service or the 
        level of service provided to an individual to the provision, by 
        the individual, of financial information that is necessarily 
        collected and processed only for the purpose of initiating, 
        rendering, billing for, or collecting payment for a service or 
        product requested by the individual;
            (2) prohibit a covered entity from offering a different 
        price, rate, level, quality or selection of goods or services

        of pricing or functionalities with respect to a product or

        section 203(a)(3); or
            (6) prohibit a covered entity from declining to provide a 
        product or service insofar as the collection and processing of 
        covered data is strictly necessary for such product or service.
    (c) Bona Fide Loyalty Program Defined.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``bona fide loyalty program'' includes rewards, 
premium features, discount or club card programs.

                    (A) concise, clear, conspicuous, and not 
                misleading;
                    (B) readily accessible to the individual, based on 
                what is reasonably anticipated within the context of 
                the relationship between the individual and the large 
                data holder;
                    (C) inclusive of an overview of individual rights 
                and disclosures to reasonably draw attention to data 
                practices that may reasonably be unexpected to a 
                reasonable person or that involve sensitive covered 
                data; and
                    (D) no more than 500 words in length.
            (2) Rulemaking.--The Commission shall issue a rule pursuant 
        to section 553 of title 5, United States Code, establishing the 
        minimum data disclosures necessary for the short-form notice 
        required under paragraph (1), which shall not exceed the 
        content requirements in subsection (b) and shall include 
        templates or models of short-form notices.

SEC. 203. INDIVIDUAL DATA OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL.

    (a) Access to, and Correction, Deletion, and Portability of, 
Covered Data.--In accordance with subsections (b) and (c), a covered 
entity shall provide an individual, after receiving a verified request 
from the individual, with the right to--
            (1) access--
                    (A) in a human-readable format that a reasonable 
                individual can understand and download from the 
                internet, the covered data (except covered data in a 
                back-up or archival system) of the individual making 
                the request that is collected, processed, or 
                transferred by the covered entity or any service 
                provider of the covered entity within the 24 months 
                preceding the request;
                    (B) the categories of any third party, if 
                applicable, and an option for consumers to obtain the 
                names of any such third party as well as and the 
                categories of any service providers to whom the covered 
                entity has transferred for consideration the covered 
                data of the individual, as well as the categories of 
                sources from which the covered data was collected; and
                    (C) a description of the purpose for which the 
                covered entity transferred the covered data of the 
                individual to a third party or service provider;
            (2) correct any verifiable substantial inaccuracy or 
        substantially incomplete information with respect to the 
        covered data of the individual that is processed by the covered 
        entity and instruct the covered entity to make reasonable 
        efforts to notify all third parties or service providers to 
        which the covered entity transferred such covered data of the 
        corrected information;
            (3) delete covered data of the individual that is processed 
        by the covered entity and instruct the covered entity to make 
        reasonable efforts to notify all third parties or service 
        provider to which the covered entity transferred such covered 
        data of the individual's deletion request; and
            (4) to the extent technically feasible, export to the 
        individual or directly to another entity the covered data of 
        the individual that is processed by the covered entity, 
        including inferences linked or reasonably linkable to the 
        individual but not including other derived data, without 
        licensing restrictions that limit such transfers in--
                    (A) a human-readable format that a reasonable 
                individual can understand and download from the 
                internet; and
                    (B) a portable, structured, interoperable, and 
                machine-readable format.
    (b) Individual Autonomy.--A covered entity may not condition, 
effectively condition, attempt to condition, or attempt to effectively 
condition the exercise of a right described in subsection (a) through--
            (1) the use of any false, fictitious, fraudulent, or 
        materially misleading statement or representation; or
            (2) the design, modification, or manipulation of any user 
        interface with the purpose or substantial effect of obscuring, 
        subverting, or impairing a reasonable individual's autonomy, 
        decision making, or choice to exercise such right.
    (c) Timing.--
            (1) In general.--Subject to subsections (d) and (e), each 
        request under subsection (a) shall be completed by any--
                    (A) large data holder within 45 days of such 
                request from an individual, unless it is demonstrably 
                impracticable or impracticably costly to verify such 
                individual;
                    (B) covered entity that is not a large data holder 
                or a covered entity meeting the requirements of section 
                209 within 60 days of such request from an individual, 
                unless it is demonstrably impracticable or 
                impracticably costly to verify such individual; or
                    (C) covered entity meeting the requirements of 
                section 209 within 90 days of such request from an 
                individual, unless it is demonstrably impracticable or 
                impracticably costly to verify such individual.
            (2) Extension.--A response period set forth in this 
        subsection may be extended once by 45 additional days when 
        reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of 
        the individual's requests, so long as the covered entity 
        informs the individual of any such extension within the initial 
        45-day response period, together with the reason for the 
        extension.
    (d) Frequency and Cost of Access.--A covered entity--
            (1) shall provide an individual with the opportunity to 
        exercise each of the rights described in subsection (a); and
            (2) with respect to--
                    (A) the first 2 times that an individual exercises 
                any right described in subsection (a) in any 12-month 
                period, shall allow the individual to exercise such 
                right free of charge; and
                    (B) any time beyond the initial 2 times described 
                in subparagraph (A), may allow the individual to 
                exercise such right for a reasonable fee for each 
                request.
    (e) Verification and Exceptions.--
            (1) Required exceptions.--A covered entity may not permit 
        an individual to exercise a right described in subsection (a), 
        in whole or in part, if the covered entity--
                    (A) cannot reasonably verify that the individual 
                making the request to exercise the right is the 
                individual whose covered data is the subject of the 
                request or an individual authorized to make such a 
                request on the individual's behalf;
                    (B) reasonably believes that the request is made to 
                interfere with a contract between the covered entity 
                and another individual;
                    (C) determines that the exercise of the right would 
                require access to or correction of another individual's 
                sensitive covered data;
                    (D) reasonably believes that the exercise of the 
                right would require the covered entity to engage in an 
                unfair or deceptive practice under section 5 of the 
                Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45); or
                    (E) reasonably believes that the request is made to 
                further fraud, support criminal activity, or the 
                exercise of the right presents a data security threat.
            (2) Additional information.--If a covered entity cannot 
        reasonably verify that a request to exercise a right described 
        in subsection (a) is made by the individual whose covered data 
        is the subject of the request (or an individual authorized to 
        make such a request on the individual's behalf), the covered 
        entity--
                    (A) may request that the individual making the 
                request to exercise the right provide any additional 
                information necessary for the sole purpose of verifying 
                the identity of the individual; and
                    (B) may not process or transfer such additional 
                information for any other purpose.
            (3) Permissive exceptions.--
                    (A) In general.--A covered entity may decline, with 
                adequate explanation to the individual, to comply with 
                a request to exercise a right described in subsection 
                (a), in whole or in part, that would--
                            (i) require the covered entity to retain 
                        any covered data collected for a single, one-
                        time transaction, if such covered data is not 
                        processed or transferred by the covered entity 
                        for any purpose other than completing such 
                        transaction;
                            (ii) be demonstrably impracticable or 
                        prohibitively costly to comply with, and the 
                        covered entity shall provide a description to 
                        the requestor detailing the inability to comply 
                        with the request;
                            (iii) require the covered entity to attempt 
                        to re-identify de-identified data;
                            (iv) require the covered entity to maintain 
                        covered data in an identifiable form or 
                        collect, retain, or access any data in order to 
                        be capable of associating a verified individual 
                        request with covered data of such individual;
                            (v) result in the release of trade secrets 
                        or other privileged or confidential business 
                        information;
                            (vi) require the covered entity to correct 
                        any covered data that cannot be reasonably 
                        verified as being inaccurate or incomplete;
                            (vii) interfere with law enforcement, 
                        judicial proceedings, investigations, or 
                        reasonable efforts to guard against, detect, 
                        prevent, or investigate fraudulent, malicious, 
                        or unlawful activity, or enforce valid 
                        contracts;
                            (viii) violate Federal or State law or the 
                        rights and freedoms of another individual, 
                        including under the Constitution of the United 
                        States;
                            (ix) prevent a covered entity from being 
                        able to maintain a confidential record of 
                        deletion requests, maintained solely for the 
                        purpose of preventing covered data of an 
                        individual from being recollected after the 
                        individual submitted a deletion request and 
                        requested that the covered entity no longer 
                        collect, process, or transfer such data;
                            (x) fall within an exception enumerated in 
                        the regulations promulgated by the Commission 
                        pursuant to subparagraph (D); or
                            (xi) with respect to requests for 
                        deletion--
                                    (I) unreasonably interfere with the 
                                provision of products or services by 
                                the covered entity to another person it 
                                currently serves;
                                    (II) delete covered data that 
                                relates to a public figure and for 
                                which the requesting individual has no 
                                reasonable expectation of privacy;
                                    (III) delete covered data 
                                reasonably necessary to perform a 
                                contract between the covered entity and 
                                the individual;
                                    (IV) delete covered data that the 
                                covered entity needs to retain in order 
                                to comply with professional ethical 
                                obligations;
                                    (V) delete covered data that the 
                                covered entity reasonably believes may 
                                be evidence of unlawful activity or an 
                                abuse of the covered entity's products 
                                or services; or
                                    (VI) for private elementary and 
                                secondary schools as defined by State 
                                law and private institutions of higher 
                                education as defined by title I of the 
                                Higher Education Act of 1965, delete 
                                covered data that would unreasonably 
                                interfere with the provision of 
                                education services by or the ordinary 
                                operation of the school or institution.
                    (B) Partial compliance.--In a circumstance that 
                would allow a denial pursuant to subparagraph (A), a 
                covered entity shall partially comply with the 
                remainder of the request if it is possible and not 
                unduly burdensome to do so.
                    (C) Number of requests.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A)(ii), the receipt of a large number of 
                verified requests, on its own, may not be considered to 
                render compliance with a request demonstrably 
                impracticable.
                    (D) Further exceptions.--The Commission may, by 
                regulation as described in subsection (g), establish 
                additional permissive exceptions necessary to protect 
                the rights of individuals, alleviate undue burdens on 
                covered entities, prevent unjust or unreasonable 
                outcomes from the exercise of access, correction, 
                deletion, or portability rights, or as otherwise 
                necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section. In 
                establishing such exceptions, the Commission should 
                consider any relevant changes in technology, means for 
                protecting privacy and other rights, and beneficial 
                uses of covered data by covered entities.
    (f) Large Data Holder Metrics Reporting.--A large data holder that 
is a covered entity shall, for each calendar year in which it was a 
large data holder, do the following:
            (1) Compile the following metrics for the prior calendar 
        year:
                    (A) The number of verified access requests under 
                subsection (a)(1).
                    (B) The number of verified deletion requests under 
                subsection (a)(3).
                    (C) The number of requests to opt-out of covered 
                data transfers under section 204(b).
                    (D) The number of requests to opt-out of targeted 
                advertising under section 204(c).
                    (E) The number of requests in each of subparagraphs 
                (A) through (D) that such large data holder (i) 
                complied with in whole or in part and (ii) denied.
                    (F) The median or mean number of days within which 
                such large data holder substantively responded to the 
                requests in each of subparagraphs (A) through (D).
            (2) Disclose by July 1 of each applicable calendar year the 
        information compiled in paragraph (1) within such large data 
        holder's privacy policy required under section 202 or on the 
        publicly accessible website of such large data holder that is 
        accessible from a hyperlink included in the privacy policy.
    (g) Regulations.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations, 
pursuant to section 553 of title 5, United States Code, as necessary to 
establish processes by which covered entities are to comply with the 
provisions of this section. Such regulations shall take into 
consideration--
            (1) the size of, and the nature, scope, and complexity of 
        the activities engaged in by the covered entity, including 
        whether the covered entity is a large data holder, nonprofit 
        organization, covered entity meeting the requirements of 
        section 209, third party, or third-party collecting entity;
            (2) the sensitivity of covered data collected, processed, 
        or transferred by the covered entity;
            (3) the volume of covered data collected, processed, or 
        transferred by the covered entity;
            (4) the number of individuals and devices to which the 
        covered data collected, processed, or transferred by the 
        covered entity relates; and
            (5) after consulting the National Institute of Standards 
        and Technology, standards for ensuring the deletion of covered 
        data under this Act where appropriate.
    (h) Accessibility.--A covered entity shall facilitate the ability 
of individuals to make requests under subsection (a) in any covered 
language in which the covered entity provides a product or service. The

                                    (III) determining access to, or 
                                restrictions on the use of, any place 
                                of public accommodation, particularly 
                                as such harms relate to the protected 
                                characteristics of individuals, 
                                including race, color, religion,

                                national origin, sex, or disability 
                                status; or
                                    (V) disparate impact on the basis 
                                of individuals' political party 
                                registration status.
            (2) Algorithm design evaluation.--Notwithstanding any other 
        provision of law, not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, a covered entity or service provider 
        that knowingly develops a covered algorithm that is designed 
        to, solely or in part, to collect, process, or transfer covered 
        data in furtherance of a consequential decision shall prior to 
        deploying the covered algorithm in interstate commerce evaluate 
        the design, structure, and inputs of the covered algorithm, 
        including any training data used to develop the covered 
        algorithm, to reduce the risk of the potential harms identified

                algorithm, or portions of a covered algorithm, that 
                will be put to use and may reasonably contribute to the 
                risk of the potential harms identified under paragraph 
                (1)(B).
                    (B) Availability.--
                            (i) In general.--A covered entity and a

                        title 18, United States Code) or other 
                        confidential or proprietary information from 
                        public disclosure under this subparagraph and 
                        the Commission shall abide by its obligations 
                        under section 6(f) of the Federal Trade

                    (C) Enforcement.--The Commission may not use any 
                information obtained solely and exclusively through a 
                covered entity or a service provider's disclosure of 
                information to the Commission in compliance with this 
                section for any purpose other than enforcing this Act

SEC. 208. DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF COVERED DATA.

    (a) Establishment of Data Security Practices.--
            (1) In general.--A covered entity or service provider shall 
        establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, 
        technical, and physical data security practices and procedures 
        to protect and secure covered data against unauthorized access 
        and acquisition.
            (2) Considerations.--The reasonable administrative, 
        technical, and physical data security practices required under 
        paragraph (1) shall be appropriate to--
                    (A) the size and complexity of the covered entity 
                or service provider;
                    (B) the nature and scope of the covered entity or 
                the service provider's collecting, processing, or 
                transferring of covered data;
                    (C) the volume and nature of the covered data 
                collected, processed, or transferred by the covered 
                entity or service provider;
                    (D) the sensitivity of the covered data collected, 
                processed, or transferred;
                    (E) the current state of the art (and limitations 
                thereof) in administrative, technical, and physical 
                safeguards for protecting such covered data; and
                    (F) the cost of available tools to improve security 
                and reduce vulnerabilities to unauthorized access and 
                acquisition of such covered data in relation to the 
                risks and nature of the covered data.
    (b) Specific Requirements.--The data security practices of the 
covered entity and of the service provider required under subsection 
(a) shall include, for each respective entity's own system or systems, 
at a minimum, the following practices:
            (1) Assess vulnerabilities.--Identifying and assessing any 
        material internal and external risk to, and vulnerability in, 
        the security of each system maintained by the covered entity 
        that collects, processes, or transfers covered data, or service 
        provider that collects, processes, or transfers covered data on 
        behalf of the covered entity, including unauthorized access to 
        or risks to such covered data, human vulnerabilities, access 
        rights, and the use of service providers. With respect to large 
        data holders, such activities shall include a plan to receive 
        and reasonably respond to unsolicited reports of 
        vulnerabilities by any entity or individual and by performing a 
        reasonable investigation of such reports.
            (2) Preventive and corrective action.--Taking preventive 
        and corrective action designed to mitigate reasonably 
        foreseeable risks or vulnerabilities to covered data identified 
        by the covered entity or service provider, consistent with the 
        nature of such risk or vulnerability and the entity's role in 
        collecting, processing, or transferring the data. Such action 
        may include implementing administrative, technical, or physical 
        safeguards or changes to data security practices or the 
        architecture, installation, or implementation of network or 
        operating software, among other actions.
            (3) Evaluation of preventive and corrective action.--
        Evaluating and making reasonable adjustments to the action 
        described in paragraph (2) in light of any material changes in 
        technology, internal or external threats to covered data, and 
        the covered entity or service provider's own changing business 
        arrangements or operations.
            (4) Information retention and disposal.--Disposing of 
        covered data in accordance with a retention schedule that shall 
        require the deletion of covered data when such data is required 
        to be deleted by law or is no longer necessary for the purpose 
        for which the data was collected, processed, or transferred, 
        unless an individual has provided affirmative express consent 
        to such retention. Such disposal shall include destroying, 
        permanently erasing, or otherwise modifying the covered data to 
        make such data permanently unreadable or indecipherable and 
        unrecoverable to ensure ongoing compliance with this section. 
        Service providers shall establish practices to delete or return 
        covered data to a covered entity as requested at the end of the 
        provision of services unless retention of the covered data is 
        required by law, consistent with section 302(a)(6).
            (5) Training.--Training each employee with access to 
        covered data on how to safeguard covered data and updating such 
        training as necessary.
            (6) Designation.--Designating an officer, employee, or 
        employees to maintain and implement such practices.
            (7) Incident response.--Implementing procedures to detect, 
        respond to, or recover from security incidents, including 
        breaches.
    (c) Regulations.--The Commission may promulgate, in accordance with 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, technology-neutral 
regulations to establish processes for complying with this section. The 
Commission shall consult with the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology in establishing such processes.

subsection (b) for the period of the 3 preceding calendar years (or for 
the period during which the covered entity or service provider has been 
in existence if such period is less than 3 years) shall--
            (1) be exempt from compliance with section 203(a)(4), 
        paragraphs (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) of section 
        208(b), and section 301(c); and
            (2) at the covered entity's sole discretion, have the 
        option of complying with section 203(a)(2) by, after receiving 
        a verified request from an individual to correct covered data 
        of the individual under such section, deleting such covered 
        data in its entirety instead of making the requested 
        correction.

are, with respect to a covered entity or a service provider, the 
following:
            (1) The covered entity or service provider's average annual 
        gross revenues during the period did not exceed $41,000,000.
            (2) The covered entity or service provider, on average, did 
        not annually collect or process the covered data of more than 
        200,000 individuals during the period beyond the purpose of 
        initiating, rendering, billing for, finalizing, completing, or 
        otherwise collecting payment for a requested service or 
        product, so long as all covered data for such purpose was 
        deleted or de-identified within 90 days, except when necessary 
        to investigate fraud or as consistent with a covered entity's 
        return policy.
            (3) The covered entity or service provider did not derive 
        more than 50 percent of its revenue from transferring covered 
        data during any year (or part of a year if the covered entity 
        has been in existence for less than 1 year) that occurs during 
        the period.
    (c) Revenue Defined.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``revenue'' as it relates to any covered entity or service provider 
that is not organized to carry on business for its own profit or that 
of its members, means the gross receipts the covered entity or service 
provider received in whatever form from all sources without subtracting 
any costs or expenses, and includes contributions, gifts, grants, dues 
or other assessments, income from investments, or proceeds from the 
sale of real or personal property.

SEC. 210. UNIFIED OPT-OUT MECHANISMS.

    (a) In General.--For the rights established under subsection (b) of 
section 204, subsection (c) of section 204 (except as provided for 
under section 101(b)(16)), and section 206(b)(3)(C), following public 
notice and opportunity to comment and not later than 18 months after 
the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall establish or 
recognize one or more acceptable privacy protective, centralized 
mechanisms, including global privacy signals such as browser or device 
privacy settings, other tools offered by covered entities or service 
providers, and registries of identifiers, for individuals to exercise 
all such rights through a single interface for a covered entity or 
service provider to utilize to allow an individual to make such opt out 
designations with respect to covered data related to such individual.
    (b) Requirements.--Any such centralized opt-out mechanism shall--
            (1) require covered entities or service providers acting on 
        behalf of covered entities to inform individuals about the 
        centralized opt-out choice;
            (2) not be required to be the default setting, but may be 
        the default setting provided that in all cases the mechanism 
        clearly represents the individual's affirmative, freely given, 
        and unambiguous choice to opt out;
            (3) be consumer-friendly, clearly described, and easy-to-
        use by a reasonable individual;
            (4) permit the covered entity or service provider acting on 
        behalf of a covered entity to have an authentication process 
        the covered entity or service provider acting on behalf of a 
        covered entity may use to determine if the mechanism represents 
        a legitimate request to opt out;
            (5) be provided in any covered language in which the 
        covered entity provides products or services subject to the 
        opt-out; and
            (6) be provided in a manner that is reasonably accessible 
        to and usable by individuals with disabilities.

                and
                    (E) serve as the point of contact between the large 
                data holder and enforcement authorities.
    (d) Large Data Holder Privacy Impact Assessments.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act or 1 year after the date on which a 
        covered entity first meets the definition of large data holder, 
        whichever is earlier, and biennially thereafter, each covered 
        entity that is a large data holder shall conduct a privacy 
        impact assessment that weighs the benefits of the large data 
        holder's covered data collecting, processing, and transfer 
        practices against the potential adverse consequences of such 
        practices, including substantial privacy risks, to individual 
        privacy.
            (2) Assessment requirements.--A privacy impact assessment 
        required under paragraph (1) shall be--
                    (A) reasonable and appropriate in scope given--
                            (i) the nature of the covered data 
                        collected, processed, and transferred by the 
                        large data holder;
                            (ii) the volume of the covered data 
                        collected, processed, and transferred by the 
                        large data holder; and
                            (iii) the potential material risks posed to 
                        the privacy of individuals by the collecting, 
                        processing, and transfer of covered data by the 
                        large data holder;
                    (B) documented in written form and maintained by 
                the large data holder unless rendered out of date by a 
                subsequent assessment conducted under paragraph (1); 
                and
                    (C) approved by the privacy protection officer 
                designated in subsection (c)(3) of the large data 
                holder, as applicable.
            (3) Additional factors to include in assessment.--In 
        assessing the privacy risks, including substantial privacy 
        risks, the large data holder must include reviews of the means 
        by which technologies, including blockchain and distributed 
        ledger technologies and other emerging technologies, are used 
        to secure covered data.
    (e) Other Privacy Impact Assessments.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act and biennially thereafter, each covered 
        entity that is not large data holder and does not meet the 
        requirements for covered entities under section 209 shall 
        conduct a privacy impact assessment. Such assessment shall 
        weigh the benefits of the covered entity's covered data 
        collecting, processing, and transfer practices that may cause a 
        substantial privacy risk against the potential material adverse 
        consequences of such practices to individual privacy.
            (2) Assessment requirements.--A privacy impact assessment 
        required under paragraph (1) shall be--
                    (A) reasonable and appropriate in scope given--
                            (i) the nature of the covered data 
                        collected, processed, and transferred by the 
                        covered entity;
                            (ii) the volume of the covered data 
                        collected, processed, and transferred by the 
                        covered entity; and
                            (iii) the potential risks posed to the 
                        privacy of individuals by the collecting, 
                        processing, and transfer of covered data by the 
                        covered entity; and
                    (B) documented in written form and maintained by 
                the covered entity unless rendered out of date by a 
                subsequent assessment conducted under paragraph (1).
            (3) Additional factors to include in assessment.--In 
        assessing the privacy risks, including substantial privacy 
        risks, the covered entity may include reviews of the means by 
        which technologies, including blockchain and distributed ledger 
        technologies and other emerging technologies, are used to 
        secure covered data.

SEC. 302. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THIRD PARTIES.

    (a) Service Providers.--A service provider--
            (1) shall adhere to the instructions of a covered entity 
        and only collect, process, and transfer service provider data 
        to the extent necessary and proportionate to provide a service 
        requested by the covered entity, as set out in the contract 
        required by subsection (b), and this paragraph does not require 
        a service provider to collect, process, or transfer covered 
        data if the service provider would not otherwise do so;
            (2) may not collect, process, or transfer service provider 
        data if the service provider has actual knowledge that a 
        covered entity violated this Act with respect to such data;
            (3) shall assist a covered entity in responding to a 
        request made by an individual under section 203 or 204, by 
        either--
                    (A) providing appropriate technical and 
                organizational measures, taking into account the nature 
                of the processing and the information reasonably 
                available to the service provider, for the covered 
                entity to comply with such request for service provider 
                data; or
                    (B) fulfilling a request by a covered entity to 
                execute an individual rights request that the covered 
                entity has determined should be complied with, by 
                either--
                            (i) complying with the request pursuant to 
                        the covered entity's instructions; or
                            (ii) providing written verification to the 
                        covered entity that it does not hold covered 
                        data related to the request, that complying 
                        with the request would be inconsistent with its 
                        legal obligations, or that the request falls 
                        within an exception to section 203 or 204;
            (4) may engage another service provider for purposes of 
        processing service provider data on behalf of a covered entity 
        only after providing that covered entity with notice and 
        pursuant to a written contract that requires such other service 
        provider to satisfy the obligations of the service provider 
        with respect to such service provider data, including that the 
        other service provider be treated as a service provider under 
        this Act;
            (5) shall, upon the reasonable request of the covered 
        entity, make available to the covered entity information 
        necessary to demonstrate the compliance of the service provider 
        with the requirements of this Act, which may include making 
        available a report of an independent assessment arranged by the 
        service provider on terms agreed to by the service provider and 
        the covered entity, providing information necessary to enable 
        the covered entity to conduct and document a privacy impact 
        assessment required by subsection (d) or (e) of section 301, 
        and making available the report required under section 
        207(c)(2);
            (6) shall, at the covered entity's direction, delete or 
        return all covered data to the covered entity as requested at 
        the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the 
        covered data is required by law;
            (7) shall develop, implement, and maintain reasonable 
        administrative, technical, and physical safeguards that are 
        designed to protect the security and confidentiality of covered 
        data the service provider processes consistent with section 
        208; and
            (8) shall allow and cooperate with, reasonable assessments 
        by the covered entity or the covered entity's designated 
        assessor; alternatively, the service provider may arrange for a 
        qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of 
        the service provider's policies and technical and 
        organizational measures in support of the obligations under 
        this Act using an appropriate and accepted control standard or 
        framework and assessment procedure for such assessments. The 
        service provider shall provide a report of such assessment to 
        the covered entity upon request.
    (b) Contracts Between Covered Entities and Service Providers.--
            (1) Requirements.--A person or entity may only act as a 
        service provider pursuant to a written contract between the 
        covered entity and the service provider, or a written contract 
        between one service provider and a second service provider as 
        described under subsection (a)(4), if the contract--
                    (A) sets forth the data processing procedures of 
                the service provider with respect to collection, 
                processing, or transfer performed on behalf of the 
                covered entity or service provider;
                    (B) clearly sets forth--
                            (i) instructions for collecting, 
                        processing, or transferring data;
                            (ii) the nature and purpose of collecting, 
                        processing, or transferring;
                            (iii) the type of data subject to 
                        collecting, processing, or transferring;
                            (iv) the duration of processing; and
                            (v) the rights and obligations of both 
                        parties, including a method by which the 
                        service provider shall notify the covered 
                        entity of material changes to its privacy 
                        practices;
                    (C) does not relieve a covered entity or a service 
                provider of any requirement or liability imposed on 
                such covered entity or service provider under this Act; 
                and
                    (D) prohibits--
                            (i) collecting, processing, or transferring 
                        covered data in contravention to subsection 
                        (a); and
                            (ii) combining service provider data with 
                        covered data which the service provider 
                        receives from or on behalf of another person or 
                        persons or collects from the interaction of the 
                        service provider with an individual, provided 
                        that such combining is not necessary to 
                        effectuate a purpose described in paragraphs 
                        (1) through (15) of section 101(b) and is 
                        otherwise permitted under the contract required 
                        by this subsection.
            (2) Contract terms.--Each service provider shall retain 
        copies of previous contracts entered into in compliance with 
        this subsection with each covered entity to which it provides 
        requested products or services.
    (c) Relationship Between Covered Entities and Service Providers.--
            (1) Determining whether a person is acting as a covered 
        entity or service provider with respect to a specific 
        processing of covered data is a fact-based determination that 
        depends upon the context in which such data is processed.
            (2) A person that is not limited in its processing of 
        covered data pursuant to the instructions of a covered entity, 
        or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a covered 
        entity and not a service provider with respect to a specific 
        processing of covered data. A service provider that continues 
        to adhere to the instructions of a covered entity with respect 
        to a specific processing of covered data remains a service 
        provider. If a service provider begins, alone or jointly with 
        others, determining the purposes and means of the processing of 
        covered data, it is a covered entity and not a service provider 
        with respect to the processing of such data.
            (3) A covered entity that transfers covered data to a 
        service provider or a service provider that transfers covered 
        data to a covered entity or another service provider, in 
        compliance with the requirements of this Act, is not liable for 
        a violation of this Act by the service provider or covered 
        entity to whom such covered data was transferred, if at the 
        time of transferring such covered data, the covered entity or 
        service provider did not have actual knowledge that the service 
        provider or covered entity would violate this Act.
            (4) A covered entity or service provider that receives 
        covered data in compliance with the requirements of this Act is 
        not in violation of this Act as a result of a violation by a 
        covered entity or service provider from which such data was 
        received.
    (d) Third Parties.--A third party--
            (1) shall not process third party data for a processing 
        purpose other than, in the case of sensitive covered data, the 
        processing purpose for which the individual gave affirmative 
        express consent or to effect a purpose enumerated in paragraph 
        (1), (3), or (5) of section 101(b) and, in the case of non-
        sensitive data, the processing purpose for which the covered 
        entity made a disclosure pursuant to section 202(b)(4); and
            (2) for purposes of paragraph (1), may reasonably rely on 
        representations made by the covered entity that transferred the 
        third party data if the third party conducts reasonable due 
        diligence on the representations of the covered entity and 
        finds those representations to be credible.
    (e) Additional Obligations on Covered Entities.--
            (1) In general.--A covered entity or service provider shall 
        exercise reasonable due diligence in--
                    (A) selecting a service provider; and
                    (B) deciding to transfer covered data to a third 
                party.
            (2) Guidance.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Commission shall publish guidance 
        regarding compliance with this subsection, taking into 
        consideration the burdens on large data holders, covered 
        entities who are not large data holders, and covered entities 
        meeting the requirements of section 209.
    (f) Rule of Construction.--Solely for the purposes of this section, 
the requirements for service providers to contract with, assist, and 
follow the instructions of covered entities shall be read to include 
requirements to contract with, assist, and follow the instructions of a 
government entity if the service provider is providing a service to a 
government entity.

SEC. 303. TECHNICAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate regulations under section 
553 of title 5, United States Code, to establish a process for the 
proposal and approval of technical compliance programs under this 
section used by a covered entity to collect, process, or transfer 
covered data.
    (b) Scope of Programs.--The technical compliance programs 
established under this section shall, with respect to a technology, 
product, service, or method used by a covered entity to collect, 
process, or transfer covered data--
            (1) establish publicly available guidelines for compliance 
        with this Act; and
            (2) meet or exceed the requirements of this Act.
    (c) Approval Process.--
            (1) In general.--Any request for approval, amendment, or 
        repeal of a technical compliance program may be submitted to 
        the Commission by any person, including a covered entity, a 
        representative of a covered entity, an association of covered 
        entities, or a public interest group or organization. Within 90 
        days after the request is made, the Commission shall publish 
        the request and provide an opportunity for public comment on 
        the proposal.
            (2) Expedited response to requests.--Beginning 1 year after 
        the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall act 
        upon a request for the proposal and approval of a technical 
        compliance program not later than 1 year after the filing of 
        the request, and shall set forth publicly in writing the 
        conclusions of the Commission with regard to such request.
    (d) Right to Appeal.--Final action by the Commission on a request 
for approval, amendment, or repeal of a technical compliance program, 
or the failure to act within the 1-year period after a request for 
approval, amendment, or repeal of a technical compliance program is 
made under subsection (c), may be appealed to a Federal district court 
of the United States of appropriate jurisdiction as provided for in 
section 702 of title 5, United States Code.
    (e) Effect on Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--Prior to commencing an investigation or 
        enforcement action against any covered entity under this Act, 
        the Commission and State attorney general shall consider the 
        covered entity's history of compliance with any technical 
        compliance program approved under this section and any action 
        taken by the covered entity to remedy noncompliance with such 
        program. If such enforcement action described in section 403 is 
        brought, the covered entity's history of compliance with any 
        technical compliance program approved under this section and 
        any action taken by the covered entity to remedy noncompliance 
        with such program shall be taken into consideration when 
        determining liability or a penalty. The covered entity's 
        history of compliance with any technical compliance program 
        shall not affect any burden of proof or the weight given to 
        evidence in an enforcement or judicial proceeding.
            (2) Commission authority.--Approval of a technical 
        compliance program shall not limit the authority of the 
        Commission, including the Commission's authority to commence an 
        investigation or enforcement action against any covered entity 
        under this Act or any other Act.
            (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
        provide any individual, class of individuals, or person with 
        any right to seek discovery of any non-public Commission 
        deliberation or activity or impose any pleading requirement on 
        the Commission if the Commission brings an enforcement action 
        of any kind.

SEC. 304. COMMISSION APPROVED COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES.

    (a) Application for Compliance Guideline Approval.--
            (1) In general.--A covered entity that is not a third-party 
        collecting entity and meets the requirements of section 209, or 
        a group of such covered entities, may apply to the Commission 
        for approval of 1 or more sets of compliance guidelines 
        governing the collection, processing, and transfer of covered 
        data by the covered entity or group of covered entities.
            (2) Application requirements.--Such application shall

                cover;
                    (C) a list of the covered entities that meet the 
                requirements of section 209 and are not third-party 
                collecting entities, if any are known at the time of 
                application, that intend to adhere to the compliance 
                guidelines; and
                    (D) a description of how such covered entities will 
                be independently assessed for adherence to such 
                compliance guidelines, including the independent

                entities that may participate in guidelines that will 
                administer such guidelines.
            (3) Commission review.--
                    (A) Initial approval.--

State Privacy Authority of a State has reason to believe that an 
interest of the residents of that State has been, may be, or is

        compensation on behalf of the residents of such State; or
            (4) obtain reasonable attorneys' fees and other litigation 
        costs reasonably incurred.
    (b) Rights of the Commission.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the

action, institute a civil action against any defendant named in the 
complaint in the action instituted by or on behalf of the Commission 
for a violation of this Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act 
that is alleged in such complaint, if such complaint alleges such 
violation affected the residents of such State or individuals 
nationwide. If the Commission brings a civil action against a covered

affirmations, or to compel the attendance of witnesses or the 
production of documentary or other evidence.
    (e) Preservation of State Powers.--Except as provided in subsection

        solely under the law in effect in the State that is preempted 
        by this Act or under another applicable Federal law; or
            (2) exercise the powers conferred on the attorney general 
        or State Privacy Authority by the laws of the State, including 
        the ability to conduct investigations, administer oaths or 
        affirmations, or compel the attendance of witnesses or the

SEC. 404. RELATIONSHIP TO FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS.

    (a) Federal Law Preservation.--
            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act or a regulation 
        promulgated under this Act may be construed to limit--

                section 64.2011 of title 47, Code of Federal 
                Regulations (or any successor regulation) regarding 
                information security breaches; or

                full application of the antitrust law. Nothing in this 
                Act explicitly or implicitly precludes the application

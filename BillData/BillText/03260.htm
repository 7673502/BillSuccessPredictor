    ``(s) General Ledger Accounts Reconciliation.--
            ``(1) In general.--Each covered issuer required to file an 
        annual or quarterly report under subsection (a) shall disclose 
        in that report whether such covered issuer has, at the time of 
        such report, completed a general ledger accounts reconciliation 
        for the most recent fiscal quarter and most recent fiscal year, 
        respectively.
            ``(2) Covered issuer defined.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `covered issuer' means an issuer with 
        respect to which a civil or criminal penalty has been imposed 
        under the securities laws by reason of the internal control 
        over financial reporting of such issuer related to the failure 
        of such issuer to reconcile general ledger accounts.''.

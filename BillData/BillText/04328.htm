To rename the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient 
clinic in San Angelo, Texas, the ``Colonel Charles and JoAnne Powell VA 
                               Clinic''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Colonel Charles Powell and his wife, Mrs. Joanne 
        Powell, served the community of San Angelo, Texas, with 
        character and dignity.
            (2) Colonel Powell served as the base commander of 
        Goodfellow Air Force Base from 1980-1984.
            (3) When the Powells moved to San Angelo, Charles was 
        ordered to help Goodfellow avoid closure and the displacement 
        of many members of the Armed Forces from the community they had 
        grown to love.
            (4) The impact of Charles' career can still be felt today 
        at Goodfellow Air Force Base, as it serves as a training school 
        for thousands of members from every Armed Force to train in 
        cryptology, intelligence, and firefighting.
            (5) Joanne assisted thousands of constituents in the 
        district offices of Representatives Tom Loeffler, Lamar Smith, 
        K. Michael Conaway, and August Pfluger.
            (6) One of the several duties Joanne spearheaded was the 
        annual process of nominations to the military service 
        academies, which was always a year-round process for her.
            (7) With Joanne's assistance, many of the young men and 
        women of the 11th District went on to serve the Nation and 
        attend one of the military service academies.
            (8) In addition, Joanne was a fierce advocate of veterans 
        and helped thousands of individuals gain access to the benefits 
        they rightfully earned.
            (9) Joanne's compassion and dedication helped make the 
        Concho Valley a better place.

SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED 
              OUTPATIENT CLINIC, SAN ANGELO, TEXAS.

clinic in San Angelo, Texas, shall after the date of the enactment of

Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(2)) is amended--

            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(B) An employer may be considered a joint employer of the 
employees of another employer only if each employer directly, actually, 
and immediately, exercises significant control over the essential terms 
and conditions of employment of the employees of the other employer, 
such as hiring such employees, discharging such employees, determining 
the rate of pay and benefits of such employees, supervising such 
employees on a day-to-day basis, assigning such employees a work 
schedule, position, or task, or disciplining such employees.''.

            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(2) An employer may be considered a joint employer of the 
employees of another employer for purposes of this Act only if each 
employer meets the criteria set forth in section 2(2)(B) of the 
National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 152(2)(B)) except that, for 
purposes of determining joint-employer status under this Act, the terms 
`employee' and `employer' referenced in such section shall have the 
meanings given such terms in this section.''.

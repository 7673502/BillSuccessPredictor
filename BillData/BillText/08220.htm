                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the Secretary of Education to carry out a grant program to 
 assist local educational agencies with ensuring that each elementary 
    and secondary school has at least one registered nurse on staff.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``One School, One Nurse Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to assist States and local 
educational agencies with ensuring that every elementary and secondary 
school has at least one full-time registered nurse on staff, and to 
maintain recommended nurse-to-student ratios, including through the 
recruitment, hiring, and retention of registered nurses.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, every 
        elementary and secondary school should have at least one full-
        time registered nurse on staff.
            (2) According to the National Center for Education 
        Statistics, during the 2015-2016 school year, only about half 
        of all public schools had a full-time registered nurse and 
        nearly 20 percent did not have any nurse on staff. Schools with 
        higher free or reduced-price lunch program eligibility rates 
        had lower rates of school nurses.
            (3) According to the Georgetown University Center for 
        Children and Families, in 2019, roughly 6 percent of children 
        in the United States were uninsured.
            (4) For children who lack health care coverage, a school 
        nurse is often a critical source of health services.
            (5) Studies suggest that schools with a full-time 
        registered nurse experience far-reaching benefits including 
        fewer student absences, students spending more time in class, 
        more accurate medical records, higher immunization rates, fewer 
        student pregnancies, and better health outcomes for students 
        with asthma or diabetes.
            (6) School nurses play a critical role in helping to manage 
        the chronic physical, emotional, mental, and social health 
        needs of students, conduct health screenings, facilitate 
        vaccinations and immunization compliance efforts, reduce 
        burdens on educators and other school staff, and support a 
        positive and healthy school climate.

SEC. 3. ONE SCHOOL, ONE NURSE GRANT PROGRAM.

    (a) Grant Program Authorized.--Not later than 12 months after the

        retain school nurses after the completion of the grant period; 
        and
            (4) a description of how the eligible entity will

        regulation), and how the eligible entity will track progress in

        and maintaining recommended nurse-to-student ratios (as 
        determined by the Secretary by regulation);
            (2) data on the number and percentage of full-time and

        ethnic groups and gender, employed at each elementary and 
        secondary school served by the eligible entity; and

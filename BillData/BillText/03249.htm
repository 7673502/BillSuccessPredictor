            (3) An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is 
        inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously 
        or unconsciously.
            (4) An individual should be discriminated against or 
        receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or 
        her race or sex.
            (5) Members of one race or sex cannot and should not 
        attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex.
            (6) An individual's moral character is necessarily 
        determined by his or her race or sex.
            (7) An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, 
        bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other 
        members of the same race or sex.
            (8) Any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, 
        or any other form of psychological distress on account of his 
        or her race or sex.
            (9) Meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are 
        racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to 
        oppress another.

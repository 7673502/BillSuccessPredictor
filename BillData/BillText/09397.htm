                                 A BILL


 
                  To promote global internet freedom.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Freedom and Operations Act 
of 2022'' or ``INFO Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. GLOBAL INTERNET FREEDOM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 3,000,000,000 people use the internet around 
        the world every day to access information.
            (2) Authoritarian and repressive governments routinely use 
        internet access as a means of suppressing information sharing 
        and communications between people, civil society organizations, 
        and journalists.
            (3) Following the arrest and subsequent murder of a 22-
        year-old woman, Mahsa Amini, while in the custody of Iran's 
        ``morality police'', the government imposed severe internet and 
        mobile network restrictions, in an attempt to isolate and 
        intimidate its people.
            (4) Under the cover of such internet blackouts, the Iranian 
        Government has intensified a brutal crackdown on peaceful 
        protestors, killing hundreds and arresting thousands more.
            (5) Following its illegal invasion of Ukraine, the Russian 
        Government has sought to restrict access to independent 
        reporting and eliminate free speech by forcing the closure of 
        independent press outlets and banning social media websites.
            (6) Under this expanding policy of state censorship and 
        surveillance, the Russian Government has blocked over 3,300 
        websites, including both social media sites such as Facebook, 
        Instagram, and Twitter, as well as the BBC, Associated Press, 
        and other international news outlets.
            (7) This authoritarian abuse of technology has dramatically 
        reduced access to independent information and has increased the 
        Kremlin's control over the daily lives of the Russian people 
        through secret monitoring systems designed to unmask and 
        surveil government critics and democracy activists.
            (8) The United States has a commitment to promote and 
        uphold a free and open internet globally.
            (9) The demand for internet freedom software, tools, and 
        technology has increased exponentially in recent years as 
        authoritarian regimes have pursued policies of censorship and 
        surveillance.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should provide direct assistance to 
        technology and communications entities engaged in internet 
        freedom programs in countries restricting internet access and 
        repressing democratic and civil society; and
            (2) the United States should help grow the capacity of 
        these entities to respond rapidly to censorship events by 
        supporting the development, licensing, and launch of platforms 
        that enable direct internet access and circumvent authoritarian 
        governments' restrictions.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
promote internet freedom through programs of the Department of State 
and the United States Agency for International Development (referred to 
in this section as ``USAID'') that preserve and expand the internet as 
an open, global space for freedom of expression and association, which 
shall be prioritized for countries--
            (1) whose governments restrict freedom of expression on the 
        internet; and
            (2) that are important to the national interest of the 
        United States.
    (d) Purpose and Coordination With Other Programs.--Global internet 
freedom programming under this section--
            (1) shall be coordinated with other United States foreign 
        assistance programs that promote democracy and support the 
        efforts of civil society--
                    (A) to counter the development of repressive 
                internet-related laws and regulations, including 
                countering threats to internet freedom at international 
                organizations;
                    (B) to combat violence against bloggers and other 
                civil society activists who utilize the internet; and
                    (C) to enhance digital security training and 
                capacity building for democracy activists;
            (2) shall seek to assist efforts--
                    (A) to research key threats to internet freedom;
                    (B) to continue the development of technologies 
                that provide or enhance access to the internet, 
                including circumvention tools that bypass internet 
                blocking, filtering, and other censorship techniques 
                used by authoritarian governments; and
                    (C) to maintain the technological advantage of the 
                Federal Government over the censorship techniques 
                described in subparagraph (B); and
            (3) shall be incorporated into country assistance and 
        democracy promotion strategies, as appropriate.
    (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated for fiscal year 2023--
            (1) $75,000,000 to the Department of State and USAID, which

        globally, and shall be matched, to the maximum extent 
        practicable, by sources other than the Federal Government, 
        including the private sector; and
            (2) $49,000,000 to the United States Agency for Global 
        Media (referred to in this section as the ``USAGM'') and its

        circumvention technologies that are designed--
                    (A) for open-source tools and techniques to 
                securely develop and distribute digital content 
                produced by the USAGM and its grantees;
                    (B) to facilitate audience access to such digital 
                content on websites that are censored;
                    (C) to coordinate the distribution of such digital 
                content to targeted regional audiences; and
                    (D) to promote and distribute such tools and 
                techniques, including digital security techniques.

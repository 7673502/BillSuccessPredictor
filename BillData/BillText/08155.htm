SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Buzz Off Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITING USE OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES.

    (a) Surveillance.--A Federal law enforcement agency may not use an 
unmanned aerial vehicle to intentionally conduct surveillance of, 
gather evidence or collect information about, or photographically or 
electronically record a specifically targeted United States citizen or 
the specifically targeted private property of a United States citizen.
    (b) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), a Federal law 
enforcement agency may use an unmanned aerial vehicle to photograph, or 
otherwise record a United States citizen for the purposes of publishing 
or otherwise publicly disseminating such photograph or recording if the 
agency obtains the written consent of such United States citizen.
    (c) Applicability.--Subsection (a) shall not apply in the case 
that--
            (1) the President, acting through the Secretary of Homeland 
        Security, authorizes use of an unmanned aerial vehicle to 
        conduct surveillance if the Secretary certifies in writing 
        under oath that the surveillance is necessary to counter a high 
        risk of a terrorist attack by a specific individual or 
        organization; or
            (2) the head of a Federal law enforcement agency first 
        obtains a search warrant signed by a judge authorizing the use 
        of an unmanned aerial vehicle.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

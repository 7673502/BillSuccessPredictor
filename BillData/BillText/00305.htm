                                 A BILL


 
     To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Officer Eugene Goodman Congressional 
Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) On January 6, 2021, the United States Capitol Building 
        was attacked by armed insurrectionists.
            (2) Members of the United States Capitol Police force were 
        quickly overrun, enabling insurrectionists to breach the 
        Capitol at multiple points.
            (3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United States Capitol 
        Police Officer Eugene Goodman confronted an angry group of 
        insurrectionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol, according 
        to video footage taken by Igor Bobic, a reporter with the 
        Huffington Post.
            (4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the mob's advance 
        towards the United States Senate Chamber and announced the 
        location of the incursion.
            (5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, Officer Goodman 
        noticed the entrance to the Senate Chamber was unguarded.
            (6) As the mob approached, Officer Goodman intentionally 
        diverted attention away from the Senate entrance and led the 
        mob to an alternate location and additional awaiting officers.
            (7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington Post reporter 
        from inside the Senate Chamber noted ``Senate sealed'' with 
        Senators, staff, and members of the press inside.
            (8) Officer Eugene Goodman's selfless and quick-thinking 
        actions doubtlessly saved lives and bought security personnel 
        precious time to secure and ultimately evacuate the Senate 
        before the armed mob breached the Chamber.
            (9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack on the Capitol, 
        Officer Goodman's heroism is recognized not only from Members 
        of Congress and staff but also from the American people they 
        represent.
            (10) By putting his own life on the line and successfully, 
        single-handedly leading insurrectionists away from the floor of 
        the Senate Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman performed his duty 
        to protect the Congress with distinction, and by his actions, 
        Officer Goodman left an indelible mark on American history.

overhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.

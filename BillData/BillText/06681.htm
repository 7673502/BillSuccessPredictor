                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint commemorative coins in 
     recognition of the 100th anniversary of the Lincoln Memorial.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``100th anniversary of the Lincoln 
Memorial Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The year 2022 marks the 100th anniversary of the 
        Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, dedicated on May 30, 
        1922.
            (2) The iconic Lincoln Memorial is a U.S. national memorial 
        built in the style of a neoclassical temple in honor of the 
        16th President of the United States. Designed by Henry Bacon 
        and sited on the western end of the National Mall across from 
        the Washington Monument, the memorial contains a grand seated 
        sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and includes inscriptions of 
        passages from the Gettysburg Address and Lincoln's second 
        inaugural address.
            (3) The most visited monument on the National Mall, the 
        Lincoln Memorial provides visitors with a grand view of the 
        Mall and meaningful and inspiring way to experience President 
        Lincoln and his legacy. It has been the site of many important 
        historical events, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s ``I Have 
        a Dream'' speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the 
        March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
            (4) Congress has invested significant funding to repair and 
        restore the Lincoln Memorial over the years. The purpose of 
        this Act is to build a long-term maintenance fund for future 
        repairs and maintenance to augment the National Park Service 
        budget and further protect and build upon Congress's initial 
        investment in the memorial.
            (5) Since 2007, the Trust for the National Mall has been 
        the leading nonprofit nonpartisan philanthropic partner of the 
        National Mall and Memorial Parks division of the National Park 
        Service dedicated to bringing private and public resources and 
        public awareness to support the preservation, restoration, and 
        enrichment of the National Mall. The Trust will provide 
        management of the maintenance fund in collaboration with the 
        National Park Service.
            (6) The Trust for the National Mall wants to honor the 
        contributions of Abraham Lincoln to our great Nation. The Trust 
        will promote and encourage support for this commemorative coin 
        as a way to increase public awareness and appreciation for 
        Lincoln's legacy and to inspire Americans to share in this 
        important effort to preserve the memorial for generations to 
        come.

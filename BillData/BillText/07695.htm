                                 A BILL


 
To amend title 10, United States Code, to prescribe the minimum number 
 of operational amphibious battle force ships that must be included in 
         the combat forces of the Navy, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. MINIMUM NUMBER OF AMPHIBIOUS BATTLE FORCE SHIPS IN THE 
              COMBAT FORCES OF THE NAVY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The amphibious warfare ship force structure of the Navy 
        must be maintained at 31, composed of 10 amphibious assault 
        ships general-purpose and multi-purpose, and 21 amphibious 
        transport dock types, in order to meet global commitments.
            (2) Amphibious warfare ships provide fleet commanders and 
        joint force commanders with credible deterrence, support active 
        campaigning strategies, and offer an option for the rapid 
        aggregation of forward, tailored, and ready forces to respond 
        to crisis and conflict.
            (3) Due to their utility across the spectrum of competition 
        and conflict, including substantial deterrent value during 
        periods of uncertainty, amphibious warfare ships are one of the 
        assets most requested by combatant commanders.
            (4) A single three-ship amphibious ready group formation 
        with an embarked Marine Expeditionary Unit provides over 2,000 
        sailors and marines, 5th generation fighters, helicopters, 
        tiltrotor aircraft, anti-air capabilities, lethal fires, and a 
        suite of sensor and communication systems that provide fleet 
        and joint force commanders with tailored options that support 
        naval expeditionary and joint force campaigns.
            (5) Amphibious-based forces employ these capabilities from 
        sovereign territory aboard ship, without the need for overseas 
        basing, as such these forces provide a unique and consequential 
        offering to the joint force.
            (6) Reductions in amphibious warfare ship procurement 
        profile and decommissioning plans that result in less than the 
        proscribed composition of 31 amphibious ships will negatively 
        impact the ability of the Navy to execute distributed maritime 
        operations; combatant commanders' access to a flexible, nimble, 
        and capable force; and the Nation's ability to force project.
            (7) Strategic global competition will continue to require 
        the need for forward postured, combat credible, strategically 
        maneuverable forces, capable of operating across a range of 
        missions and threat environments--amphibious warfare ships are 
        critical to providing this capability.
    (b) Minimum Requirement.--Section 8062 of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsections (c) through (f) as 
        subsections (d) through (g), respectively; and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following new 
        subsection:
    ``(c) The naval combat forces of the Navy shall include not less 
than 31 operational amphibious battle force ships (as defined in 
section 8671(d) of this title). For purposes of this subsection, an 
operational amphibious battle force ship includes such a ship that is 
temporarily unavailable for worldwide deployment due to routine or 
scheduled maintenance or repair.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

   increase choice, improve quality, and reduce costs for consumers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Open App Markets Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) App.--The term ``app'' means a software application or 
        electronic service that may be run or directed by a user on a 
        computer, a mobile device, or any other general purpose 
        computing device.
            (2) App store.--The term ``app store'' means a publicly 
        available website, software application, or other electronic 
        service that distributes apps from third-party developers to 
        users of a computer, a mobile device, or any other general 
        purpose computing device.
            (3) Covered company.--The term ``covered company'' means 
        any person that owns or controls an app store for which users 
        in the United States exceed 50,000,000.
            (4) Developer.--The term ``developer'' means a person that 
        owns or controls an app or an app store.
            (5) In-app payment system.--The term ``in-app payment 
        system'' means an application, service, or user interface to 
        manage billing or process the payments from users of an app.
            (6) Nonpublic business information.--The term ``nonpublic 
        business information'' means nonpublic data that is--
                    (A) derived from a developer or an app or app store 
                owned or controlled by a developer, including 
                interactions between users and the app or app store of 
                the developer; and
                    (B) collected by a covered company in the course of 
                operating an app store or providing an operating 
                system.

SEC. 3. PROTECTING A COMPETITIVE APP MARKET.

    (a) Exclusivity and Tying.--A covered company shall not--
            (1) require developers to use or enable an in-app payment 
        system owned or controlled by the covered company or any of its 
        business partners as a condition of the distribution of an app 
        on an app store or accessible on an operating system;
            (2) require as a term of distribution on an app store that 
        pricing terms or conditions of sale be equal to or more 
        favorable on its app store than the terms or conditions under 
        another app store; or
            (3) take punitive action or otherwise impose less favorable 
        terms and conditions against a developer for using or offering 
        different pricing terms or conditions of sale through another 
        in-app payment system or on another app store.
    (b) Interference With Legitimate Business Communications.--A 
covered company shall not impose restrictions on communications of 
developers with the users of an app of the developer through the app or 
direct outreach to a user concerning legitimate business offers, such 
as pricing terms and product or service offerings. Nothing in this 
subsection shall prohibit a covered company from providing a user the 
option to offer consent prior to the collection and sharing of the data 
of the user by an app.
    (c) Nonpublic Business Information.--A covered company shall not 
use nonpublic business information derived from a third-party app for 
the purpose of competing with that app.
    (d) Interoperability.--A covered company that controls the 
operating system or operating system configuration on which its app 
store operates shall allow and provide readily accessible means for 
users of that operating system to--
            (1) choose third-party apps or app stores as defaults for 
        categories appropriate to the app or app store;
            (2) install third-party apps or app stores through means 
        other than its app store; and
            (3) hide or delete apps or app stores provided or 
        preinstalled by the app store owner or any of its business 
        partners.
    (e) Self-Preferencing in Search.--
            (1) In general.--A covered company shall not provide 
        unequal treatment of apps in an app store through unreasonably 
        preferencing or ranking the apps of the covered company or any 
        of its business partners over those of other apps in organic 
        search results.
            (2) Considerations.--Unreasonably preferencing--
                    (A) includes applying ranking schemes or algorithms 
                that prioritize apps based on a criterion of ownership 
                interest by the covered company or its business 
                partners; and
                    (B) does not include clearly disclosed advertising.
    (f) Open App Development.--A covered company shall provide access 
to operating system interfaces, development information, and hardware 
and software features to developers on a timely basis and on terms that 
are equivalent or functionally equivalent to the terms for access by 
similar apps or functions provided by the covered company or to its 
business partners.

SEC. 4. PROTECTING THE SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF USERS.

    (a) In General.--
            (1) No violation.--Subject to section (b), a covered 
        company shall not be in violation of section 3 for an action 
        that is--
                    (A) necessary to achieve user privacy, security, or 
                digital safety;
                    (B) taken to prevent spam or fraud;
                    (C) necessary to prevent unlawful infringement of 
                preexisting intellectual property; or
                    (D) taken to prevent a violation of, or comply 
                with, Federal or State law.
            (2) Privacy and security protections.--In paragraph (1), 
        the term ``necessary to achieve user privacy, security, or 
        digital safety'' includes--
                    (A) allowing an end user to opt in, and providing 
                information regarding the reasonable risks, prior to 
                enabling installation of the third-party apps or app 
                stores;
                    (B) removing malicious or fraudulent apps or app 
                stores from an end user device;
                    (C) providing an end user with the technical means 
                to verify the authenticity and origin of third-party 
                apps or app stores; and
                    (D) providing an end user with option to limit the 
                collection sharing of the data of the user with third-
                party apps or app stores.
    (b) Requirements.--Subsection (a) shall only apply if the covered 
company establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the action 
described in that subsection is--
            (1) applied on a demonstrably consistent basis to--
                    (A) apps of the covered company or its business 
                partners; and
                    (B) other apps;
            (2) not used as a pretext to exclude, or impose unnecessary 
        or discriminatory terms on, third-party apps, in-app payment 
        systems, or app stores; and
            (3) narrowly tailored and could not be achieved through a 
        less discriminatory and technically possible means.

SEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission, the Attorney 
        General, and any attorney general of a State subject to the 
        requirements in paragraph (3) shall enforce this Act in the 
        same manner, by the same means, and with the same jurisdiction, 
        powers, and duties as though all applicable terms and 
        provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et 
        seq.), the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act 
        (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), and Antitrust Civil Process Act (15 
        U.S.C. 1311 et seq.), as appropriate, were incorporated into 
        and made a part of this Act.
            (2) Federal trade commission independent litigation 
        authority.--If the Federal Trade Commission has reason to 
        believe that a covered company violated this Act, the Federal 
        Trade Commission may commence a civil action, in its own name 
        by any of its attorneys designated by it for such purpose, to 
        recover a civil penalty and seek other appropriate relief in a 
        district court of the United States against the covered 
        company.
            (3) Parens patriae.--Any attorney general of a State may 
        bring a civil action in the name of such State for a violation 
        of this Act as parens patriae on behalf of natural persons 
        residing in such State, in any district court of the United 
        States having jurisdiction of the defendant, and may secure any 
        form of relief provided for in this section.
    (b) Suits by Developers Injured.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (3), any 
        developer injured by reason of anything forbidden in this Act 
        may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in 
        the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has 
        an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and 
        shall recover threefold the damages by the developer sustained 
        and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee. 
        The court may award under this paragraph, pursuant to a motion 
        by such developer promptly made, simple interest on actual 
        damages for the period beginning on the date of service of the 
        pleading of the developer setting forth a claim under this Act 
        and ending on the date of judgment, or for any shorter period 
        therein, if the court finds that the award of such interest for 
        such period is just in the circumstances. In determining 
        whether an award of interest under this paragraph for any 
        period is just in the circumstances, the court shall consider 
        only--
                    (A) whether the developer or the opposing party, or 
                either party's representative, made motions or asserted 
                claims or defenses so lacking in merit as to show that 
                such party or representative acted intentionally for 
                delay or otherwise acted in bad faith;
                    (B) whether, in the course of the action involved, 
                the developer or the opposing party, or either party's 
                representative, violated any applicable rule, statute, 
                or court order providing for sanctions for dilatory 
                behavior or otherwise providing for expeditious 
                proceedings; and
                    (C) whether the developer or the opposing party, or 
                either party's representative, engaged in conduct 
                primarily for the purpose of delaying the litigation or 
                increasing the cost thereof.
            (2) Injunctive relief.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (3), any developer shall be entitled to sue for and have 
        injunctive relief, in any court of the United States having 
        jurisdiction over the parties, against threatened loss or 
        damage by a violation of this Act, when and under the same 
        conditions and principles as injunctive relief against 
        threatened conduct that will cause loss or damage is granted by 
        courts of equity, under the rules governing such proceedings, 
        and upon the execution of proper bond against damages for an 
        injunction improvidently granted and a showing that the danger 
        of irreparable loss or damage is immediate, a preliminary 
        injunction may issue. In any action under this paragraph in 
        which the plaintiff substantially prevails, the court shall 
        award the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, 
        to such plaintiff.
            (3) Foreign state-owned enterprises.--A developer of an app 
        that is owned by, or under the control of, a foreign state may 
        not bring an action under this subsection.

SEC. 6. REPORTING.

    Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Trade Commission, the Comptroller General of the United States, 
and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice shall each 
separately review and provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of 
this Act on competition, innovation, barriers to entry, and 
concentrations of market power or market share after the date of 
enactment of this Act.

SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

    Nothing in this Act may be construed--
            (1) to limit--
                    (A) any authority of the Attorney General or the 
                Federal Trade Commission under the antitrust laws (as 
                defined in the first section of the Clayton Act (15 
                U.S.C. 12), the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 
                41 et seq.), or any other provision of law; or
                    (B) the application of any law;
            (2) to require--
                    (A) a covered company to provide service under a 
                hardware or software warranty for damage caused by 
                third-party apps or app stores installed through means 
                other than the app store of the covered company; or
                    (B) customer service for the installation or 
                operation of third-party apps or app stores described 
                in subparagraph (A);
            (3) to prevent an action taken by a covered company that is 
        reasonably tailored to protect the rights of third parties 
        under section 106, 1101, 1201, or 1401 of title 17, United 
        States Code, or rights actionable under sections 32 or 43 of

        provisions of certain international conventions, and for other 
        purposes'', approved July 5, 1946 (commonly known as the 
        ``Lanham Act'' or the ``Trademark Act of 1946'') (15 U.S.C. 
        1114, 1125), or corollary State law;
            (4) to require a covered company to license any 
        intellectual property, including any trade secrets, owned by or 
        licensed to the covered company;
            (5) to prevent a covered company from asserting preexisting 
        rights of the covered company under intellectual property law 
        to prevent the unlawful use of any intellectual property owned 
        by or duly licensed to the covered company; or
            (6) to require a covered company to interoperate or share 
        data with persons or business users that--
                    (A) are on any list maintained by the Federal 
                Government by which entities are identified as limited 
                or prohibited from engaging in economic transactions as 
                part of United States sanctions or export control 
                regimes; or
                    (B) have been identified by the Federal Government 
                as national security, intelligence, or law enforcement 
                risks.

SEC. 8. SEVERABILITY.

application of such provisions to any person or circumstance shall not 
be affected thereby.

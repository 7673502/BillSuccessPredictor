                                 A BILL


 
  To require the Secretary of the Army to treat the lease of land for 
  operations of the Corona Municipal Airport as a valid lease for the 
        purposes of renewing such lease, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Corona Municipal Airport Lease 
Extension Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1960, Corona established the Corona Municipal 
        Airport to provide recreational opportunities for aviators 
        throughout southern California.
            (2) The City of Corona initially entered into a lease 
        agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on December 24, 
        1959.
            (3) The City's lease with the Corps of Engineers enabled 
        the construction of the airport into its current configuration.
            (4) For over 60 years, the Corona Municipal Airport has 
        supported local businesses, tourism, and recreation for local 
        residents and the region.
            (5) The Corona Municipal Airport maintains the capability 
        to assist in public safety efforts to protect life and property 
        where aviation assets may be necessary.
            (6) The Corona Municipal Airport supports approximately one 
        dozen local, small businesses.
            (7) The Corona Municipal Airport continues to drive 
        business development and local tourism for the City of Corona 
        and connect people throughout southern California to those 
        opportunities.
            (8) The City of Corona's lease with the Corps of Engineers 
        is set to expire on January 30, 2037, without an opportunity to 
        grandfather the facility under existing policies.
            (9) The closure of the Corona Municipal Airport would 
        deprive aviators of significant opportunities to enjoy this 
        recreation pastime as fewer small, recreational airports in the 
        region remain open and accessible.
            (10) Extending the City's lease with the Corps of Engineers 
        would allow this culturally and economically significant 
        facility to continue serving aviators in the region.

SEC. 3. CORONA MUNICIPAL AIRPORT LEASE.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, or any 
policy of the Corps of Engineers, the Secretary of the Army, acting 
through the Chief of Engineers, shall treat the covered lease as a 
valid lease of land at a water resource development project under 
section 4 of the Act entitled, ``An Act authorizing the construction of 
certain public works on rivers and harbors for flood control, and for 
other purposes'', approved December 22, 1944 (16 U.S.C. 460d), for the 
purpose of renewing the covered lease.
    (b) Definition of Covered Lease.--In this Act, the term ``covered 
lease'' means the lease of land and water areas within the Prado Flood 
Control Basin Project Area between the Department of the Army and the 
City of Corona, California, for operations of the Corona Municipal 
Airport (Recreation Lease No. DACW09-1-67-60).

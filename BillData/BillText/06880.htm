                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                             March 1, 2022

Mr. Cleaver (for himself and Mr. Katko) introduced the following bill; 
       which was referred to the Committee on Financial Services

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To increase the number of landlords participating in the Housing Choice 
                            Voucher program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Choice in Affordable Housing Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``Housing Choice Voucher program'' means the 
        tenant-based assistance program under section 8(o) of the 
        United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)); and
            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Housing 
        and Urban Development.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Housing Choice Voucher program is the Federal 
        Government's largest program helping low-income families, the 
        elderly, and persons with disabilities to afford decent, safe, 
        and sanitary housing in the private market.
            (2) The Housing Choice Voucher program is proven to have 
        positive impacts on voucher holders, including increased 
        housing stability, reduced homelessness, and children lifted 
        out of poverty.
            (3) As a public-private partnership, the Housing Choice 
        Voucher program relies on the willingness of private landlords 
        to accept vouchers.
            (4) Landlord participation is declining in the Housing 
        Choice Voucher program, with an average of 10,000 housing 
        providers leaving the program each year between 2010 and 2016.
            (5) Landlord participation is especially lacking in ``high-
        opportunity neighborhoods'' that have low poverty rates and 
        good access to quality schools, jobs, and public 
        transportation.
            (6) The Secretary has conducted and continues to conduct 
        research on landlord participation in the Housing Choice 
        Voucher program.
            (7) The Moving to Work demonstration program of the 
        Department of Housing and Urban Development has given 
        participating public housing agencies the ability to test 
        innovative strategies to incentivize landlords to accept 
        vouchers.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Housing Choice Voucher program should be improved 
        to increase the number of landlords, particularly landlords 
        with units in high-opportunity neighborhoods, who accept 
        vouchers in order to expand housing choice and opportunity, and 
        further fair housing; and
            (2) Federal programs to help people afford safe and decent 
        housing are important in all communities, including urban, 
        rural, and tribal areas.

              PROGRAM.

                        subsection for more than 1 year.
                            ``(iv) Limit.--The owner of an eligible 
                        unit may not receive more than 1 incentive

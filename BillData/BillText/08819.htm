                Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207(e))).

                employee in the applicable State or locality, whichever 
                is greater, in which the employee is employed.
            (3) Varying schedule hours calculation.--In the case of a 
        part-time employee described in subsection (b)(2)(B) whose 
        schedule varies from week to week to such an extent that an 
        employer is unable to determine with certainty the number of 
        hours the employee would have worked if such employee had not 
        taken paid emergency time under subsection (a), the employer 
        shall use the following in place of such number:
                    (A) Subject to subparagraph (B), a number equal to 
                the average number of hours that the employee was 
                scheduled per week over the 6-month period ending on 
                the date on which the employee takes the paid emergency 
                time, including hours for which the employee took leave 
                of any type.
                    (B) If the employee did not work over such period, 
                the reasonable expectation of the employee at the time 
                of hiring of the average number of hours per week that 
                the employee would normally be scheduled to work.
            (4) Guidelines.--Not later than 120 days after the date of

            (5) Reasonable and practicable notice.--After the first 
        workday (or portion thereof) an employee receives paid 
        emergency time under this Act, an employer may require the 
        employee to follow reasonable and practicable notice procedures 
        in order to continue receiving such paid emergency time.
            (6) Publication of pay limitation.--Not later than December 
        1 of each year, the Secretary of Labor shall publish the amount 
        determined under paragraph (1)(B) that will be in effect for

entitle any restored employee to--

        during any period during which such restored employee uses paid 
        emergency time; or
            (2) any right, benefit, or position of employment other 
        than any right, benefit, or position to which the employee

    (a) In General.--Section 627 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 
U.S.C. 547) is amended to read:

``SEC. 627. CONDITIONS OF SALE OR TRANSFER.

    ``(a) Value of Cable System Upon Sale or Transfer.--
            ``(1) After denial of franchise renewal.--If a renewal of a 
        franchise held by a cable operator is denied and the 
        franchising authority acquires ownership of the cable system or 
        effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another 
        person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair 
        market value, determined on the basis of the cable system 
        valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the 
        franchise itself.
            ``(2) After revocation of franchise for cause.--If a 
        franchise held by a cable operator is revoked for cause and the 
        franchising authority acquires ownership of the cable system or 
        effects a transfer of ownership of the system to another 
        person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair 
        market value.
    ``(b) Limitations on Authority of Franchising Authority With 
Respect to Transfer of Franchise.--
            ``(1) In general.--A franchising authority may not--
                    ``(A) preclude a cable operator from transferring a 
                franchise to a person to which such franchise was not 
                initially granted; or
                    ``(B) require a cable operator to which a franchise 
                is initially granted to receive approval from the 
                franchising authority for the transfer of such 
                franchise to a person who to which such franchise was 
                not initially granted.
            ``(2) Notification.--In the case of the transfer of a 
        franchise to a person to which such franchise was not 
        originally granted, a franchising authority may require a cable 
        operator to which a franchise was initially granted to, not 
        later than 15 days after a transfer of a franchise, notify the 
        franchising authority in writing of such transfer.
            ``(3) Transfer defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        `transfer' means the assignment rights under a franchise 
        through any transaction, including a merger, sale, assignment, 
        restructuring, or transfer of control of a cable operator or a 
        cable system.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--This section, and the amendments made by 
subsection (a), shall take effect 6 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
    (c) Application.--This section, and the amendment made by 
subsection (a), shall apply to a franchise granted--
            (1) on or after the effective date established by 
        subsection (b); or
            (2) before such date, if such franchise (including any 
        renewal term thereof) is in effect on such date.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

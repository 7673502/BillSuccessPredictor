                 Security Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Save Medicare Act''.

SEC. 2. MEDICARE ADVANTAGE RENAMED.

    (a) In General.--There is hereby established the ``Alternative 
Private Health Plan'' program. The Alternative Private Health Plan 
program shall consist of the program under part C of title XVIII of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et seq.).
    (b) References.--Notwithstanding section 201 of the Medicare 
Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Public 
Law 108-173) and subject to subsection (c), any reference to the 
program under part C of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-21 et seq.) shall be deemed a reference to the Alternative 
Private Health Plan program and, with respect to such part, any 
reference to ``Medicare+Choice'', ``Medicare Advantage'', or ``MA'' is 
deemed a reference to the Alternative Private Health Plan program.
    (c) Transition.--In order to provide for an orderly transition and 
avoid beneficiary and provider confusion, the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services shall provide for an appropriate transition in the use 
of the terms ``Medicare Advantage'', ``MA'', and ``Alternative Private 
Health Plan'' in reference to the program under part C of title XVIII 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-21 et seq.). Such 
transition shall be fully completed for all materials for plan years 
beginning on or after October 15, 2022. Before the completion of such 
transition, any reference to the Alternative Private Health Plan 
program shall be deemed to include a reference to ``Medicare+Choice'', 
``Medicare Advantage'', and ``MA''.

SEC. 3. CIVIL MONEY PENALTY.

    Section 1128A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7a) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(t)(1) Any entity that advertises a plan under part C of title 
XVIII of this Act by using the term `Medicare' in the title of the plan 
on or after the date of enactment of this Act shall be subject to a 
civil money penalty of $100,000 for each instance of the use of the 
term in a plan title.
    ``(2) The provisions of subsections (c), (g), and (h) shall apply 
to a civil money penalty under this subsection in the same manner as 
such provisions apply to a penalty, assessment, or proceeding under 
subsection (a).''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

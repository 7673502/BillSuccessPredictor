SEC. 2. WORKERS ELIGIBLE FOR CORONAVIRUS STATE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS.

    (a) Ineligibility of Elected Public Officials.--Section 602(g)(2) 
of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 802(g)(2)) is amended by striking 
``The term `eligible workers' means'' and all that follows and 
inserting the following:
                    ``(A) In general.--The term `eligible workers' 
                means those workers needed to maintain continuity of 
                operations of essential critical infrastructure sectors 
                and additional sectors as each Governor of a State or 
                territory, or each Tribal government, may designate as 
                critical to protect the health and well-being of the 
                residents of their State, territory, or Tribal 
                government.
                    ``(B) Exception.--An elected public official with 
                authority to designate who is eligible to receive 
                premium pay under this section shall not be an eligible 
                worker, except that such an elected official who 
                performs other work during the COVID-19 public health 
                emergency that is unrelated to the elected official's 
                duties may be considered an eligible worker for such 
                other work so long as individuals performing such work 
                who are not elected public officials are designated as 
                eligible workers.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall 
apply with respect to funds provided under a payment made under section 
602 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 802) which are obligated or 
expended on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.

To prevent methane waste and pollution from oil and gas operations, and 
                          for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the ``Methane Waste Prevention Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. CONTROLLING METHANE EMISSIONS FROM THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS 
              SECTOR.

    (a) National Goals.--The goals of this section are to steadily 
reduce the quantity of United States methane emissions from the oil and 
natural gas sector such that--
            (1) in calendar year 2025, the quantity of United States 
        methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector is at 
        least 65 percent below calendar year 2012 emissions; and
            (2) in calendar year 2030, the quantity of United States 
        methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector is at 
        least 90 percent below calendar year 2012 emissions.
    (b) Regulations To Meet the National Goals.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall issue regulations 
        pursuant to the existing authority of the Administrator under 
        section 111 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411) to control 
        methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector to 
        achieve the national goals described in subsection (a).
            (2) Covered sources.--The regulations promulgated pursuant 
        to this subsection shall apply to sources of methane from every 
        segment of oil and natural gas systems, including oil and 
        natural gas production, processing, transmission, distribution, 
        and storage.
            (3) Meeting the goal for 2025.--

    (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section 1 of such 
Act is amended by inserting after the item relating to section 117 the 
following:

``Sec. 118. Gas waste reduction and enhancement of gas measuring and 
                            reporting.''.
    (c) Updates.--The Secretary of the Interior shall update the 
regulations required by the amendments made by this section when the 
Secretary determines appropriate, but no less frequently than once 
every five years, to reflect new information regarding gas waste, the 
impacts of that waste, and the availability of technologies and 
performance measures to reduce gas waste.
    (d) Application of Prior Rule.--The final rule entitled ``Waste 
Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource 
Conservation'', as published in the Federal Register November 18, 2016 
(81 Fed. Reg. 83008), is hereby reinstated, and each of its provisions 
shall apply unless and until the effective date of a subsequent final 
rule promulgated under the amendment made by subsection (a), or 
promulgated under another applicable authority, that replaces or 
repeals such provision.
    (e) Assessment of Venting, Flaring, and Fugitive Releases.--Not 
later than 180 days after the end of the 1-year period beginning on the 
date the Secretary of the Interior first receives data submitted under 
the requirements established under subsection (b) of section 118 of the 
Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982, as amended by this 
section, the Secretary shall--
            (1) submit a report to Congress describing--
                    (A) the volume of fugitive releases, and gas

                operations (as those terms are used in such section); 
                and
                    (B) additional regulations the Secretary considers 
                would help further curtail venting, flaring, and 
                fugitive releases, or the rational basis for not 
                issuing such additional regulations if the Secretary 
                considers additional regulations would not be 
                appropriate to further curtail venting, flaring, and 
                fugitive releases; and
            (2) issue regulations described in the report required by 
        paragraph (1)(B) not later than 1 year after the date of the 
        submission of the report.

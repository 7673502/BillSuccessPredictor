                                 A BILL


 
To direct the United States Government to support extending the mandate 
  of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela 
               which is set to expire in September 2022.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Assuring that the Fact-Finding 
Examination Continues to Track Human Rights in Venezuela Act'' or the 
``AFFECT Human Rights in Venezuela Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In its Resolution 42/25 adopted on September 27, 2019, 
        the United Nations Human Rights Council established an 
        independent fact-finding mission, the Independent International 
        Fact-Finding Mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
        (in this section referred to as the ``Fact-Finding Mission'') 
        ``to investigate extrajudicial executions, enforced 
        disappearances, arbitrary detentions and torture and other 
        cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment since 2014 with a view to 
        ensuring full accountability for perpetrators and justice for 
        victims''. The mandate of the Fact-Finding Mission was extended 
        by the United Nations Human Rights Council on October 6, 2020, 
        for an additional two years, until September 2022, through its 
        Resolution 45/20.
            (2) The Fact-Finding Mission has identified specific 
        incidents and patterns establishing reasonable grounds to 
        conclude that violations of international human rights and 
        criminal law have been committed in Venezuela, according to its 
        September 2020 report.
            (3) The Fact-Finding Mission has faced several constraints, 
        including lack of access to work in-country, travel limitations 
        due to the COVID-19 pandemic, disrupted interviews due to 
        electricity and internet failures, and limited ability to 
        secure witness statements and key documents. Despite these 
        challenges, the Fact-Finding Mission was able to carry out its 
        investigative and analytical work and generate reports that 
        serve as an invaluable resource for victims, civil society 
        organizations, and international accountability mechanisms.
            (4) The United States has historically used its voice, 
        vote, and influence at the United Nations to address human 
        rights abuses around the world and to seek to hold perpetrators 
        accountable.
            (5) Marta Valinas, Chair of the Fact-Finding Mission, 
        reported at the 49th session of the Human Rights Council that 
        the Venezuelan people ``have endured a decade of deepening 
        economic, humanitarian and human rights crises, as well as the 
        breaking down of State institutions, all of this exacerbated, 
        most recently, by the impact of COVID-19. The clearest showing 
        of this are the more than six million people who have had to 
        leave the country.''.

              MISSION ON THE BOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA.

            (2) give due consideration to the Fact-Finding Mission's 
        reported conclusions in developing and executing the foreign

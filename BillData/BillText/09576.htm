SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The climate crisis is raging and is already imposing 
        significant costs on the economy of the United States.
            (2) The Biden-Harris Administration has committed to 
        reducing harmful climate pollution by 50 to 52 percent below 
        2005 levels economy-wide by 2030.
            (3) Increasing energy efficiency will improve energy 
        security, save money on energy bills, create jobs, and reduce 
        harmful climate pollution.
            (4) Building energy benchmarking and disclosure helps 
        provide transparency in building energy efficiency and has 
        provided substantial benefits at affordable costs to State and 
        local governments who have adopted benchmarking, including 
        reducing energy use and emissions, helping tenants become 
        informed about the utility costs associated with properties, 
        helping tenants experience better health and comfort in 
        properties, helping building owners experience lower vacancy 
        and turnover rates, and allowing policymakers to make more 
        informed decisions about future energy efficiency policies.
            (5) A Federal benchmarking requirement will reduce harmful 
        climate pollution that crosses State boundaries, provide 
        information for people relocating to other States, and 
        harmonize building energy efficiency and disclosure 
        requirements in metropolitan areas that cross State lines.

        to comply with a benchmarking requirement of a State or local 
        government that the Administrator has determined meets or 
        exceeds the benchmarking submission requirements under section 
        4.
            (2) Listing.--
                    (A) In general.--For purposes of this section, the 
                Administrator shall list, and update the list 
                periodically, the States and local governments that 
                have benchmarking requirements that meet or exceed the 
                benchmarking submission requirements under section 4.

        from making a benchmarking submission or a time extension for 
        making a benchmarking submission if the request for such 
        exemption or a time extension establishes that due to special 
        circumstances not based on a condition caused by actions of the 
        applicant, compliance with requirements of the initiative would 
        cause undue hardship or would not be in the public interest.
            (2) Determination.--The Administrator shall determine and 
        describe the circumstances in which the owner of a covered 
        property may be exempt from making a benchmarking submission or

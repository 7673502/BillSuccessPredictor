                                 A BILL


 
     To designate Ukraine under section 244 of the Immigration and 
   Nationality Act to permit nationals of Ukraine to be eligible for 
 temporary protected status under such section, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukrainian Protection Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On February 24, 2022, Vladimir Putin launched a 
        ``special military operation'' in Ukraine, and has since 
        authorized hundreds of missile and artillery attacks against 
        Ukraine and sent tens of thousands of Russian troops into 
        Ukraine in an unlawful and unprovoked act of war.
            (2) On February 27, 2022, Vladimir Putin ordered his 
        nuclear forces to be on high alert.
            (3) Conservative approximations estimate that hundreds of 
        Ukrainians have been killed and thousands wounded as a result 
        of Russian attacks, and that more Ukrainians will die or be 
        severely wounded if Russia does not end its attack on Ukraine.
            (4) During ongoing Russian attacks on Ukrainian soil, 
        millions of Ukrainian citizens have had to seek shelter in 
        their homes, bomb shelters, and subway stations.
            (5) Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, almost 900,000 
        Ukrainian refugees have already fled the country to neighboring 
        countries, such as Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia.
            (6) It is estimated that there will be up to 4 million 
        refugees as a result of Russian attacks on Ukraine if the 
        conflict continues to escalate.
            (7) Russian airstrikes against Ukraine have severely 
        damaged residential buildings and key residential 
        infrastructure in Ukraine, including major airports, a public 
        square and opera house in Kharkiv, a hospital area in Vuhledar, 
        and Kyiv's main television tower, causing television broadcasts 
        in Ukraine's capital to temporarily cease.
            (8) On February 24, 2022, the U.N. Secretary General stated 
        of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: ``The use of force by one 
        country against another is the repudiation of the principles 
        that every country has committed to uphold. . . . We know the 
        toll of war. With deaths rising, we are seeing images of fear, 
        anguish and terror in every corner of Ukraine.''.
            (9) On February 24, 2022, the U.N. High Commissioner on 
        Refugees stated of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: ``The 
        humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be 
        devastating. There are no winners in war, but countless lives 
        will be torn apart.''.
            (10) On February 24, 2022, the UNICEF Executive Director 
        stated of the Russian invasion of Ukraine: ``UNICEF is deeply 
        concerned that intensifying hostilities in Ukraine pose an 
        immediate threat to the lives and wellbeing of the country's 
        7.5 million children. Heavy weapons fire along the line of 
        contact has already damaged critical water infrastructure and 
        education facilities in recent days. Unless the fighting 
        subsides, tens of thousands of families could be displaced, 
        dramatically escalating humanitarian needs.''.
            (11) On February 26, 2022, the United Nations Office for 
        the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs released their first 
        report on the impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, noting 
        that: ``Significant infrastructural damage has left hundreds of 
        thousands of people without electricity or water, while bridges 
        and roads damaged by shelling have left communities cut off 
        from markets for food and other basic supplies.''.
            (12) On February 24, 2022, the State Department issued a 
        Travel Advisory Level 4: Do Not Travel. This advisory read, in 
        part: ``Do not travel to Ukraine due to armed conflict and 
        COVID-19. . . . On February 24, Russia's forces attacked major 
        Ukrainian cities, and the Ukrainian government closed its 
        airspace to commercial flights due to Russia's military 
        actions. . . . The security situation throughout Ukraine is 
        highly volatile, and conditions may deteriorate without 
        warning. U.S. citizens should remain vigilant and take 
        appropriate steps to increase their security awareness. Know 
        the location of your closest shelter or protected space. In the 
        event of mortar and/or rocket fire, follow the instructions 
        from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you 
        feel your current location is no longer safe, you should 
        carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a 
        different location.''.
            (13) While United States policy advises Americans that 
        current conditions make it unsafe to travel to Ukraine, the 
        same conditions make it dangerous and inappropriate to forcibly 
        repatriate Ukrainians at this time.
            (14) Ukraine's recent crisis and existing dangers to anyone 
        located in Ukraine, which have been recognized by domestic and 
        international actors, clearly make Ukrainian nationals 
        currently in the United States eligible for temporary protected 
        status under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of sections 244(b)(1) of 
        the Immigration and Nationality Act (commonly known as 
        ``TPS'').
            (15) There are more than 30,000 Ukrainian nationals 
        residing in the United States who could benefit from TPS 
        designation during this ongoing conflict.
            (16) TPS grants temporary protection from deportation to 
        nationals of a country in which environmental or political 
        events have occurred which make it temporarily unsafe to deport 
        them. TPS has been granted to nationals of many countries due 
        to ongoing armed conflicts in these nationals' home countries.
            (17) TPS is appropriate and necessary to grant to 
        Ukrainians in the United States given the ongoing violent 
        conflict in Ukraine.

SEC. 3. DESIGNATION FOR PURPOSES OF GRANTING TEMPORARY PROTECTED 
              STATUS.

    (a) Designation.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of section 244 of the 
        Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a), Ukraine shall 
        be treated as if such country had been designated under 
        subsection (b) of that section, subject to the provisions of 
        this section.
            (2) Period of designation.--The initial period of such 
        designation shall begin on the date of enactment of this Act 
        and shall remain in effect for 18 months.
    (b) Aliens Eligible.--In applying section 244 of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a) pursuant to the designation made 
under this section, and subject to subsection (c)(3) of such section, 
an alien who is a national of Ukraine is deemed to meet the 
requirements of subsection (c)(1) of such section only if the alien--
            (1) is admissible as an immigrant, except as otherwise 
        provided under subsection (c)(2)(A) of such section, and is not 
        ineligible for temporary protected status under subsection 
        (c)(2)(B) of such section; and
            (2) registers for temporary protected status in a manner 
        that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall establish.
    (c) Consent To Travel Abroad.--The Secretary of Homeland Security 
shall give the prior consent to travel abroad described in section 
244(f)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a(f)(3)) 
to an alien who is granted temporary protected status pursuant to the 
designation made under this section, if the alien establishes to the 
satisfaction of the Secretary of Homeland Security that emergency and 
extenuating circumstances beyond the control of the alien require the 
alien to depart for a brief, temporary trip abroad. An alien returning 
to the United States in accordance with such an authorization shall be 
treated the same as any other returning alien provided temporary 
protected status under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1254a).
                                 &lt;all&gt;

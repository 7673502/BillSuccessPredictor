                                 A BILL


 
 To provide incentives for States to recover fraudulently paid Federal 
      and State unemployment compensation, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Chase COVID Unemployment Fraud Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic criminal 
        organizations, including international cybercrime rings and 
        opportunistic foreign actors, exploited a national crisis to 
        steal billions from American taxpayers. Fraud delayed 
        legitimate payments to unemployed workers and turned thousands 
        of Americans into unwitting identity theft victims.
            (2) The size, scope, and severity of pandemic unemployment 
        fraud is not fully known.
            (3) The Labor Department's Office of the Inspector General 
        estimates that at least $163 billion of the $872.5 billion in 
        Federal-State unemployment benefits paid during the pandemic 
        could have been improperly paid, with a significant portion 
        attributable to fraud. Just over $4 billion of these funds have 
        been recovered.
            (4) The White House has estimated an 18.71 percent improper 
        payment rate in the Federal-State unemployment insurance 
        program in fiscal year 2021. This estimate does not include 
        improper payments made in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance 
        program, nor does it include the period of greatest fraudulent 
        activity when generous $600 weekly Federal supplements made 
        unemployment a lucrative target for fraudsters.
            (5) According to the Government Accountability Office, from 
        March 2020 through October 2021, 145 individuals pleaded guilty 
        to Federal charges of defrauding unemployment insurance 
        programs and Federal charges are pending against 250 
        individuals.
            (6) As of January 2022, the Labor Department's Inspector 
        General reported opening more than 31,000 investigative matters 
        involving alleged unemployment fraud and reported that it 
        assisted other Federal and State agencies in identifying and 
        recovering more than $565 million in fraudulently stolen 
        unemployment benefits.
            (7) In California, State workforce officials confirmed they 
        paid out fraudulent unemployment claims totaling $11 billion 
        and identified another $20 billion in claims still under 
        investigation.
            (8) The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee 
        published a report compiling the results of investigations from 
        16 State auditors, finding $39 billion in pandemic unemployment 
        fraud.
            (9) There is growing evidence that criminal groups 
        perpetrating unemployment fraud pose a threat to national 
        security.
            (10) According to the Department of Justice and U.S. Secret 
        Service, a significant amount of fraud was driven by known 
        transnational organized criminal networks, including cartels 
        with origins in countries including China, Ghana, Nigeria, 
        Romania, and Russia.
            (11) The Department of Justice reports that the 
        International Organized Crime Intelligence Operations Center 
        has referred a large number of unemployment fraud cases to the 
        Federal Bureau of Investigation.
            (12) The American people expect Congress to be an effective 
        steward of taxpayer dollars and vigilant in pursuit and 
        recovery of funds when taxpayer dollars are improperly paid.
            (13) Congress has a responsibility to gain restitution for 
        American taxpayers by ensuring aggressive identification, 
        investigation, and prosecution of criminal fraud in pandemic 
        unemployment programs.

SEC. 3. RECOVERING FEDERAL FRAUDULENT COVID UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
              PAYMENTS.

            ``(2) Repayment.--In the case of individuals who have 
        received amounts of pandemic unemployment assistance under this 
        section to which they were not entitled, the State shall 
        require such individuals to repay the amounts of such pandemic 
        unemployment assistance to the State agency, except that the 
        State agency may waive such repayment if it determines that--
                    ``(A) the payment of such pandemic unemployment 
                assistance was without fault on the part of any such 
                individual; and
                    ``(B) such repayment would be contrary to equity 
                and good conscience.
            ``(3) Recovery by state agency.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The State agency shall recover 
                the amount to be repaid, or any part thereof, by 
                deductions from any unemployment compensation payable 
                to such individual under any State or Federal 
                unemployment compensation law administered by the State 
                agency or under any other State or Federal law 
                administered by the State agency which provides for the 
                payment of any assistance or allowance with respect to 
                any week of unemployment, during the 5-year period 
                after the date such individuals received the payment of 
                the pandemic unemployment assistance to which they were 
                not entitled, in accordance with the same procedures as 
                apply to the recovery of overpayments of regular 
                unemployment benefits paid by the State, except that a 
                State may retain a percentage of any amounts recovered

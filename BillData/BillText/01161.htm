1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Exclusion of portion of lump-sum social 
                security benefits.--
                            ``(i) In general.--The term `modified 
                        adjusted gross income' shall not include so 
                        much of any lump-sum social security benefit 
                        payment as is attributable to months ending 
                        before the beginning of the taxable year.
                            ``(ii) Lump-sum social security benefit 
                        payment.--For purposes of this subparagraph, 
                        the term `lump-sum social security benefit 
                        payment' means any payment of social security 
                        benefits (as defined in section 86(d)(1)) which 
                        constitutes more than 1 month of such benefits.
                            ``(iii) Election to include excludable 
                        amount.--A taxpayer may elect (at such time and 
                        in such manner as the Secretary may provide) to 
                        have this subparagraph not apply for any 
                        taxable year.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013.

period of limitation on a credit or refund resulting from the amendment 
made by subsection (a) expires before the end of the 1-year period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, refund or credit of 
such overpayment (to the extent attributable to such amendment) may, 
nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed before the 
close of such 1-year period.

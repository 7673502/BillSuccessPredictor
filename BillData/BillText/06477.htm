                                 A BILL


 
   To require the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of the 
  Interior to carry out a study with respect to wildlife trafficking 
            financing and proceeds, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Wildlife Trafficking 
Financing and Proceeds Study Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 2017 report by the think tank, Global Financial 
        Integrity, entitled ``Transnational Crime and the Developing 
        World'', determined that the annual global retail value of 
        illegal wildlife trade is between $5 billion to $23 billion, 
        and when losses to ecosystem services are considered, the World 
        Bank estimates the cost of environmental crime is between $1 
        trillion and $2 trillion, annually.
            (2) Wildlife traffickers do not prefer particular species 
        or commodities, but instead, according to the non-governmental 
        organization, United for Wildlife, wildlife traffickers focus 
        on the demand, availability, profit potential, and relatively 
        low risk associated with acquiring, trading, and distributing 
        wildlife globally.
            (3) The trafficking of wildlife affects human health 
        because of undetected spread of zoonotic diseases, scarcity in 
        food resources, and the environmental results of degraded 
        ecosystems.
            (4) Also, the trafficking of illicit wildlife such as 
        pangolins from Africa, macaws from Peru, turtles from the 
        United States, and rosewood species smuggled globally threatens 
        our national security at home and American interests abroad 
        because rogue organizations, including transnational criminal 
        organizations, use the proceeds to fund illegal and violent 
        acts throughout the world, fueling corruption and benefiting 
        from corrupt government officials, weakening the rule of law, 
        and distorting commercial markets.
            (5) Many of these supply chains are affected by Chinese 
        activity, from the criminal organizations involved in the 
        initial poaching of targeted commodities to the demand for 
        goods produced from endangered plants and animals.
            (6) The Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces 
        conducted an investigation known as ``Operation Apex'' which 
        identified extensive overlaps among drug trafficking 
        organizations, professional money launderers, and wildlife 
        trafficking syndicates.
            (7) A study conducted by Federal entities that examined 
        wildlife trafficking networks determined that--
                    (A) more than two-thirds of persons trafficking 
                wildlife also trafficked narcotics;
                    (B) 10 percent of persons trafficking wildlife were 
                doing so to finance terrorism; and
                    (C) a small percentage of persons trafficking 
                wildlife were doing so to finance the proliferation of 
                nuclear materials.
            (8) Because wildlife trafficking is executed as part of a 
        commodity-agnostic global enterprise, the United States and 
        allies of the United States should focus efforts to reduce 
        wildlife trafficking on curtailing the expansive networks that 
        traffic wildlife and other goods and on bringing enforcement 
        actions against persons who launder the proceeds of those 
        persons who traffic wildlife rather than pursue specific 
        nations, groups, or commodities.
            (9) In the past decade, the illicit wildlife trade has 
        moved online, mainly to social media platforms, creating 
        jurisdictional and technical challenges for law enforcement.

SEC. 3. STUDY.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of

        trafficking, including shared supply chains and financial 
        facilitators;
            (5) an overview of the national security implications 
        associated with wildlife trafficking and the financing and

                    (B) potential threats to public health, including

            (7) an examination of payments methods used to facilitate 
        the trafficking of wildlife, including its financing and

                other surface web platforms;
                    (B) identifies payments- and proceeds-related

            (12) recommendations about ways in which interdisciplinary 
        collaboration across Federal agencies could be incentivized to 
        maximize information and analysis from investigations into 
        other types of trafficking and which may benefit from the 
        information and analysis gleaned from wildlife trafficking 
        investigations;
            (13) an examination of how data collection, collaboration, 
        analysis, and technology tools, including artificial

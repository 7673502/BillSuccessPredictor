                                 A BILL


 
 To improve the public service loan forgiveness program under section 
455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, to improve loan forgiveness 
   eligibility provisions under such Act for teachers, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Chance at Public Service Loan 
Forgiveness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The public service loan forgiveness program under 
        section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
        1087e(m)) was created in 2007 to attract individuals to public 
        service by forgiving an individual's Federal loans under part D 
        of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 
        et seq.; 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) after 10 years of employment 
        in areas of national need.
            (2) These public service careers, which include employment 
        in military, emergency management, government, public safety, 
        law enforcement, public health, education, child care, social 
        work, services for individuals with disabilities, services for 
        the elderly, public interest legal services, and library 
        sciences, pay substantially less than similar careers in the 
        private sector.
            (3) The public sector also repeatedly experiences workforce 
        shortages, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (4) An undergraduate degree, certification, or advanced 
        degree is a prerequisite to enter or advance in these public 
        service careers. Yet, research suggests that the prospect of 
        several decades of student loan payments often deters 
        individuals from pursuing careers in public service.
            (5) The public service loan forgiveness program has 
        substantially failed. In 2018, 99 percent of the borrowers who 
        applied for relief under the program were denied due to 
        improper type of loans, employment, or repayment plan, or the 
        number of payments that they had made.
            (6) Advocates and enforcement agencies, including 38 State 
        Attorneys General and the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
        Protection, have repeatedly found that all of the major Federal 
        student loan servicers provided inaccurate information to 
        borrowers who were interested in or relying upon the public 
        service loan forgiveness program. They also found that 
        servicers repeatedly steered borrowers away from public service 
        loan forgiveness into higher monthly payments and into 
        deferment and forbearances.
            (7) This has caused millions of public servants irreparable 
        economic harm, including preventing them from buying a home, 
        opening a small business, starting a family, or retiring, 
        because of their student debt.
            (8) Despite the recent actions of President Biden's 
        administration to improve the public service loan forgiveness 
        program, these actions are limited and will not fully atone for 
        the repeated, pervasive, and systemic actions by Federal 
        student loan servicers to prevent public servants from fully 
        benefitting from this program.

SEC. 3. MAKING FORGIVENESS ATTAINABLE FOR PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS.

    Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1087e(m)) is amended--
            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:

                    ``(A) obtained an eligible Federal Direct Loan on

                obtained; and
                    ``(C) while employed full-time in public service

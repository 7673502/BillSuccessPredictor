                    (B) apply successful, valid clearance results from 
                a TSA Security Threat Assessment to satisfy vetting

                of that individual's eligibility to participate in TSA 
                Security Threat Assessment programs; and
                    (B) enroll an individual in two or more TSA 
                Security Threat Assessment programs without additional 
                cost to the individual.
            (3) Special rule.--If an individual under subsection (a) is

        than one TSA Security Threat Assessment program, such 
        individual may be required to revisit a TSA-designated 
        universal enrollment center for the collection of additional

        were not so collected in connection with any other such 
        program.
    (b) Publication.--The Administrator of the Transportation Security

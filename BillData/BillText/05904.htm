SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DEEPAVALI DAY.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Deepavali, also known as the ``Festival of Lights'', is 
        celebrated as a day of thanksgiving and the beginning of the 
        New Year by more than six million Americans, including Hindu 
        Americans, Buddhist Americans, Sikh Americans, Jain Americans, 
        Indo-Caribbean Americans, and non-secular Asian Americans.
            (2) Deepavali falls on the last day of the last month or 
        the New Moon Day in the month of Kartika which occurs during 
        October or November in the Vedic lunar calendar.
            (3) Deepavali signifies the victory of light and knowledge 
        over darkness and ignorance and is an annual time for 
        celebration, reflection, prayer, and gatherings with family, 
        friends, and community.
            (4) The Deepavali holiday celebrates values that are 
        aligned with the democratic principles of the United States, 
        including the triumph of knowledge, light, justice, and freedom 
        over darkness, injustice, tyranny, fear, and oppression.

SEC. 3. DEEPAVALI DAY.

    Section 6103(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended by 
inserting after the item relating to Columbus Day the following:
            ``Deepavali Day.''.

        50989; relating to requiring coronavirus disease 2019

        mandate requiring such Federal employee to receive a COVID-19 
        vaccination.
            (2) Prohibition on adverse action.--No adverse action 
        (including a suspension, furlough, removal, or reduction in pay 
        or grade) may be taken against any Federal employee on the 
        basis of such Federal employee not receiving a COVID-19 
        vaccination pursuant to paragraph (1).
            (3) Federal employee defined.--In this subsection, the term 
        ``Federal employee'' has the meaning given the term 
        ``employee'' in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code, 
        and includes an individual who is--
                    (A) an officer or employee of the United States 
                Postal Service or of the Postal Regulatory Commission; 
                and
                    (B) an employee appointed under chapter 73 or 74 of 
                title 38, United States Code, notwithstanding section 
                7425(b) of such title.
    (b) Federal Contractors.--Any contract entered into by the Federal 
Government that requires any employee or individual described under 
that contract, or any subcontract (at any tier), to receive a COVID-19 
vaccination shall include--
            (1) an exemption from such requirement for any such 
        employee or individual who is a critical infrastructure worker;
            (2) a requirement that such exemption be incorporated into 
        each lower-tier subcontract, if any; and
            (3) a requirement that the contractor may not retaliate 
        against any employee on the basis of such employee not 
        receiving a COVID-19 vaccination under such exemption.
    (c) Critical Infrastructure Worker Defined.--In this Act, the term 
``critical infrastructure worker'' means an essential critical 
infrastructure worker identified in the guidance from the Director of 
the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency entitled ``Guidance on the 
Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce: Ensuring Community and 
National Resilience In COVID-19 Response'', dated August 5, 2021, or

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting and Enhancing Public 
Access to Codes Act'' or the ``Pro Codes Act''.

SEC. 2. WORKS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO LAW.

    Chapter 1 of title 17, United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following new section:
``Sec. 123. Works Incorporated by Reference into Law
    ``(a) Work Incorporated by Reference Into Law or Regulation.--An 
original work of authorship otherwise subject to protection under this 
title that has been adopted or incorporated by reference, in full or in 
part, into any Federal, State, or municipal law or regulation, shall 
retain such protection only if the owner of the copyright makes the 
work available at no monetary cost for viewing by the public in 
electronic form on a publicly accessible website in a location on the 
website that is readily accessible to the public.
    ``(b) Burden of Proof.--In any cause of action in which a party 
asserts that the owner of a copyright has failed to comply with the 
requirements of subsection (a), the burden of proof shall be on the 
party making such an assertion to prove that the owner of the copyright 
has failed to comply.
    ``(c) Transparency.--Nothing in this section shall be construed as 
inconsistent with the requirements for transparency in Federal 
expenditure information as set forth in the DATA Act (Public Law 113-
101; 31 U.S.C. 6101).''.

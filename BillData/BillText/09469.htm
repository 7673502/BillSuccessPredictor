            ``(4) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        the Mental Health Education Grant program should be funded by

        117-2) funding.
    ``(b) Distribution of Grants to Candidates.--Payments under this 
subpart shall be made, in accordance with regulations promulgated by

        attends an eligible institution on less than a full-time basis 
        (including a candidate who attends an eligible institution on 
        less than a half-time basis) during any year, the amount of a 
        grant under this subpart for which that candidate is eligible 
        shall be reduced in proportion to the degree to which that 
        candidate is not attending on a full-time basis, in accordance 
        with a schedule of reductions established by the Secretary for 
        the purposes of this subpart, computed in accordance with this 
        subpart. Such schedule of reductions shall be established by 
        regulation and published in the Federal Register in accordance 
        with section 482 of this Act.
            ``(2) No exceeding cost.--The amount of a grant awarded

            ``(2) Remedial course.--Nothing in this subpart shall be 
        construed to exclude from eligibility courses of study which 
        are noncredit or remedial in nature (including courses in 
        English language acquisition) which are determined by the 
        eligible institution to be necessary to help the candidate be 
        prepared for the pursuit of a first masters degree or, in the 
        case of courses in English language instruction, to be 
        necessary to enable the candidate to utilize already existing 
        knowledge, training, or skills.

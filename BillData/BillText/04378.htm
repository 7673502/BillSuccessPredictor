   To encourage the development of specialized foster care programs 
 designed specifically for large sibling groups, sibling groups with a 
         wide age range, and sibling groups with complex needs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Sibling Relationships in 
Foster Care Act''.

SEC. 2. COMPETITIVE GRANT PILOT PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
              SPECIALIZED FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY 
              FOR LARGE SIBLING GROUPS, SIBLING GROUPS WITH A WIDE AGE 
              RANGE, AND SIBLING GROUPS WITH COMPLEX NEEDS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in 
this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a 
competitive grant pilot program under which, during the 5-year period 
that begins with the date of the enactment of this section, the 
Secretary shall make not more than 5 grants to eligible entities who 
have applied therefor to encourage the development of specialized 
foster care programs designed specifically for groups of 3 or more 
siblings, sibling groups with a wide age range, and sibling groups 
with, or that include a youth with, complex needs. For purposes of the 
preceding sentence, a youth has complex needs if the youth exhibits 
challenging or risky behaviors that could cause themself or others 
serious harm, has mental health needs of such severity that the 
participation of the youth in daily life may be impaired either with or 
without services being rendered to help, has a disability (as defined 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act), or has an illness that 
requires continuous monitoring or is life-threatening, and complex 
needs include issues that may arise from siblings in foster care with a 
different parent, which could impact the ability of the siblings to be 
placed together, or from a youth with a history of trauma.
    (b) Eligible Entity.--In this section, the term ``eligible entity'' 
means a State child welfare agency, a State, tribal, or local agency, a 
faith- or community-based organization, or a nonprofit organization 
that has expertise and demonstrated experience, as well as state 
supervision, in administering a foster care program.
    (c) Applications.--An eligible entity that desires to receive a 
grant under this section shall submit to the Secretary an application 
that includes--
            (1) a description of how funds received under the grant 
        will be used to place together sibling groups described in 
        subsection (a);
            (2) a description of the specialized foster care program 
        involved, and how the program is designed for the placement of 
        sibling groups described in subsection (a);
            (3) data describing the challenges of placing, and number 
        of, sibling groups described in subsection (a) that are 
        awaiting placements; and
            (4) such other information as the Secretary may reasonably 
        require.
    (d) Use of Funds.--A recipient of a grant under this section may 
use the grant funds only to develop specialized foster care programs 
which are--
            (1) designed to identify available placements for, and 
        place together, sibling groups described in subsection (a); and
            (2) evidence-based, and proven to substantially increase 
        joint sibling placements.
    (e) Reporting Requirement.--As a condition of receiving a grant 
under this section, the grant recipient shall submit to the Secretary a 
written report on the number of children in the specialized foster care 
program involved, the size of the sibling groups served by the program, 
the methods used to place children with their siblings under the 
program, and the outcomes of the placements.
    (f) Regulations.--The Secretary may prescribe such regulations as 
may be necessary to carry out this section.
    (g) Limitations on Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out 
this section, there are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary 
not more than $10,000,000, which is authorized to remain available 
during the 5-year period referred to in subsection (a).

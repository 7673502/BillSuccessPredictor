the end the following new sections:

``SEC. 518. DESIGNATION OF MAJOR DEMOCRATIC ALLIES.

    ``(a) Designation.--
            ``(1) In general.--The President may designate a country 
        that the President determines meets the standards under 
        paragraph (2) as a major democratic ally for purposes of this 
        Act and the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.).
            ``(2) Standards.--A country meets the standards under this 
        paragraph if the country--

            ``(4) Initial designations.--Ukraine, the Republic of 
        Georgia, and the Republic of Moldova shall be deemed to have

        Congress of such designation of those countries.

        take such steps as may be necessary to simplify and accelerate 
        the provision of defense articles to countries designated as 
        major democratic allies under subsection (a), including by 
        ensuring that, in selecting countries with which the Secretary 
        of Defense will seek to enter into a security of supply 
        arrangement, the Secretary of Defense gives priority to such 
        countries.
            ``(2) Improved trade terms for defense articles and 
        strategic materials.--The President, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of State and the Secretary of Commerce, shall provide 
        for improved trade terms for defense articles and strategic

        allies under subsection (a) and the United States, including by 
        waiving or reducing, in whole or in part, tariffs for the 
        importation from such countries into the United States of such 
        articles and materials.
            ``(3) Democratic alliance commissions.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The President shall seek to 
                establish a bilateral commission between each country 
                designated as a major democratic ally under subsection 
                (a) and the United States for the purpose of 
                facilitating bilateral efforts relating to security 
                cooperation, security assistance, the promotion of 
                democracy, human rights, trade, and such other issues 
                as the President may determine appropriate and 
                consistent with such designation. Each commission so 
                established shall be known as a `Democratic Alliance 
                Commission'.
                    ``(B) Meetings.--Each Democratic Alliance 
                Commission established between a country designated as 
                a major democratic ally and the United States pursuant 
                to paragraph (A) shall hold regular meetings. Such 
                meetings shall be co-chaired by the Secretary of State

                the government of such country.
                    ``(C) Preexisting commissions.--If the President 
                determines that, as of the date on which a country is 
                designated as a major democratic ally under subsection

                previously established bilateral commission between 
                that country and the United States with the capability 
                to serve the purpose referred to in subparagraph (A),

                Commission' for purposes of that subparagraph and the 
                President shall not be required to seek to establish a 
                new commission.

a major democratic ally under this section, the President may terminate 
such designation if the President determines, taking into consideration 
the findings of the annual reports submitted pursuant to section 519(c) 
and such other considerations as the President may determine 
appropriate, that the country does not meet the standards under 
subsection (a)(2).
    ``(d) Rule of Construction.--The designation of a country as a 
major democratic ally under this section may not be construed as a 
substitute or impediment to--
            ``(1) accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization;
            ``(2) entrance into a bilateral security treaty with the 
        United States; or
            ``(3) entrance into any other form of alliance or alignment 
        with the United States or the Euro-Atlantic community.
    ``(e) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Defense article.--The term `defense article' has the 
        meaning given that term in section 47 of the Arms Export 
        Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2794).
            ``(2) Security supply arrangement.--The term `security 
        supply arrangement' means a non-binding international agreement 
        between the Secretary of Defense and an appropriate counterpart

        services between the United States and the foreign government.

              FROM RUSSIAN AGGRESSION.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--Consistent with longstanding United States 
policy, and consistent with the declaration at the 2008 North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (NATO) Summit in Bucharest, Romania, that Ukraine 
and the Republic of Georgia will accede to NATO, it is the sense of 
Congress that Ukraine, the Republic of Georgia, and the Republic of 
Moldova, should it wish to join, would be welcome and valuable allies 
in NATO upon accession.
    (b) Actions Relating to Ukraine and Republic of Georgia.--
            (1) In general.--The President shall--
                    (A) direct the Permanent Representative of the

                influence of the United States at NATO to advocate for 
                and accelerate the accession of Ukraine and the 
                Republic of Georgia to NATO; and
                    (B) until the date on which such accessions have 
                occurred, take such steps as may be necessary to ensure 
                the independence, sovereignty, and security of Ukraine 
                and the Republic of Georgia.
            (2) Annual report.--On an annual basis until the date on 
        which Ukraine and the Republic of Georgia accede to NATO, the 
        Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report on the 
        efforts taken by the President during the year covered by the 
        report to advocate for and accelerate the accession of Ukraine 
        and the Republic of Georgia to NATO.
    (c) United States Policy Relating to Defense of Certain NATO Member 
States.--
            (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States that 
        the President shall consider any direct or indirect armed 
        attack attributable to the Russian Federation against a member 
        state of NATO intervening in defense of any country described 
        in paragraph (2) against Russian aggression as an armed attack 
        subject to the principle of collective defense pursuant to 
        Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on 
        April 4, 1949.
            (2) Countries described.--The countries described in this 
        paragraph are the following:

                    (C) Ukraine.
                    (D) Any other country in Europe that is not a 
                member state of NATO.

enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall complete the 
development of a separate plan for the defense against Russia, 
consistent with the required actions under subsection (b)(1), as 
applicable, of each of the countries listed in subparagraphs (A) 
through (C) of subsection (c)(2).

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DETERRENCE OF FURTHER RUSSIAN AGGRESSION 
              AGAINST UKRAINE WITH RESPECT TO THREAT OF WEAPONS OF MASS 
              DESTRUCTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Russian Federation is currently engaged in a 
        brutal, illegal, premeditated, and destructive war against the 
        sovereign, democratic country of Ukraine.
            (2) The Russian war on Ukraine is in gross, clear, and 
        uncorrected violation of the principles of the Helsinki Final 
        Act, in contravention of the United Nations Charter, in 
        violation of its obligations under the 1994 Budapest 
        Memorandum, and an unmitigated moral stain on its countenance.
            (3) The Russian leadership has made numerous implied and 
        overt threats regarding the potential use of chemical, 
        biological, or nuclear weapons of mass destruction in 
        connection with its barbaric war on Ukraine.
            (4) The Russian war on Ukraine is not only a humanitarian 
        catastrophe and a global and national security crisis, but also 
        a direct and potentially irreparable threat to global 
        nonproliferation, including notorious and gross Russian 
        violations of its obligations under the Budapest Memorandums 
        and the conduct of a civilized state.
            (5) In exchange for Ukraine eliminating all nuclear weapons 
        from its territory, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum committed its 
        signatories, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, 
        to refrain from the threat or use of force or economic coercion 
        against Ukraine, and provided guarantees for the independence 
        and sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.
            (6) The employment of chemical or biological weapons by 
        Russia would be in violation of its obligations under the 
        Chemical Weapons Convention, the Geneva Protocol, and the 
        Biological Weapons Convention.
            (7) The United States does not seek war, and urges an 
        immediate end to Russian aggression in and against Ukraine, but 
        the potential use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons 
        of mass destruction by the Russian military constitutes grave 
        escalation over redlines that imperil United States national 
        security and international peace.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the President should--
                    (A) declare that the Russian employment of 
                chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons of mass 
                destruction, including low-yield ``tactical'' nuclear 
                weapons, ``false flag'' operations using such weapons 
                of mass destruction, and the purposeful or deliberate 
                targeting or neglect of nuclear facilities that leads 
                to a nuclear event, against or in connection with the 
                Russian war on Ukraine, would represent crimes against 
                humanity;
                    (B) treat such crimes against humanity as an urgent 
                national and global security threat that may require, 
                in concert with other member states of the North 
                Atlantic Treaty Organization, the employment of any 
                available conventional means as necessary to secure the 
                peace, including the potential need to degrade and

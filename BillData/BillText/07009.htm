To prohibit the importation of all petroleum products originating from 
         Russia into the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Use Stocks, Stop Russia Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF RUSSIAN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

    (a) Prohibition.--The President shall prohibit the importation of 
all petroleum products (as such term is defined in section 3 of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6202)) originating from 
Russia into the customs territory of the United States (as such term is 
defined in General Note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule).
    (b) Removal.--The President may remove the prohibition under 
subsection (a) with respect to petroleum products described in such 
subsection if the President determines that all hostile Russian troops 
have been withdrawn from areas under the sovereignty of Ukraine.

SEC. 3. KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE.

    (a) Authorization.--TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, L.P. may 
construct, connect, operate, and maintain the pipeline facilities at 
the international border of the United States and Canada at Phillips 
County, Montana, for the import of oil from Canada to the United States 
as described in the Presidential Permit of March 29, 2019 (84 Fed. Reg. 
13101 (April 3, 2019)).
    (b) Presidential Permits.--No Presidential permit or any other 
Executive order shall be required for the construction, connection, 
operation, or maintenance of the pipeline facilities described in 
paragraph (1).

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING DOMESTIC ETHANOL AND OTHER FUELS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States--
            (1) can use domestically produced energy, including 
        renewable energy, to meet the current demand for energy in the 
        United States; and
            (2) should prioritize the use of available inventories and 
        surpluses of fossil fuel and ethanol in the United States 
        before using fossil fuel and ethanol that is imported from 
        foreign countries.

SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON DRAWDOWN AND SALE OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM THE 
              STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the period that 
begins on the date of enactment of this Act and ends on the date the 
President determines that all hostile Russian troops have been 
withdrawn from areas under the sovereignty of Ukraine, the drawdown and 
sale of petroleum products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is 
prohibited.

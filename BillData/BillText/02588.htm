 To allow veterans to use, possess, or transport medical marijuana and 
    to discuss the use of medical marijuana with a physician of the 
   Department of Veterans Affairs as authorized by a State or Indian 
                     Tribe, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Medical Marijuana Safe 
Harbor Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Chronic pain affects the veteran population, with 
        almost 60 percent of veterans returning from serving in the 
        Armed Forces in the Middle East, and more than 50 percent of 
        older veterans, who are using the health care system of the 
        Department of Veterans Affairs living with some form of chronic 
        pain.
            (2) In 2018, opioids accounted for approximately 70 percent 
        of all drug overdose deaths in the United States.
            (3) Veterans are twice as likely to die from opioid related 
        overdoses than nonveterans.
            (4) States with medical cannabis laws have a 24.8 percent 
        lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate compared with 
        States without medical cannabis laws.
            (5) Marijuana and its compounds show promise for treating a 
        wide-range of diseases and disorders, including pain 
        management.
            (6) Medical marijuana in States where it is legal may serve 
        as a less harmful alternative to opioids in treating veterans.

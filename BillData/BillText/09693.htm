                                 A BILL


 
     To amend the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 to assign unique 
 identification numbers to each lobbyist who registers under such Act 
    and to each client of the lobbyist and each person who provides 
strategic lobbying services in support of the lobbyist, to require the

services in support of registered lobbyists under such Act, to require 
  the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the Secretary of the 
Senate to assign a unique identification number to each individual who 
    registers as a lobbyist under such Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Lobbying Disclosure Reform Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the right to petition government for redress of 
        grievances is a fundamental right in our representative 
        democracy, which is often realized through lobbying;
            (2) responsible representative government requires public 
        awareness of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence the 
        public decision-making process in both the legislative and 
        executive branches of the Federal Government;
            (3) existing lobbying disclosure laws have not been as 
        effective as they could be because of unclear statutory 
        language, weak administrative and enforcement provisions, and 
        an absence of clear guidance as to who is required to register 
        and what they are required to disclose;
            (4) the effective public disclosure of the identity and 
        extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence Federal 
        officials in the conduct of government actions will increase 
        public confidence in the integrity of government; and
            (5) experience with lobbying laws and regulations for 
        nearly a half century led to substantial improvements in the 
        law in 1995, and experience with the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 
        1995 over the last decade provides a sound basis for new 
        refinements today.

              CLIENTS, AND PROVIDERS OF STRATEGIC LOBBYING SERVICES.

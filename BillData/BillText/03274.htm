                                 A BILL


 
  To establish the National Fab Lab Network, a nonprofit organization 
     consisting of a national network of local digital fabrication 
 facilities providing universal access to advanced manufacturing tools 
   for workforce development, STEM education, developing inventions, 
creating businesses, producing personalized products, mitigating risks, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Fab Lab Network Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Scientific discoveries and technical innovations are 
        critical to the economic and national security of the United 
        States.
            (2) Maintaining the leadership of the United States in 
        science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will require 
        a diverse population with the skills, interest, and access to 
        tools required to advance these fields.
            (3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in communications 
        and computation provided individuals with the internet and 
        personal computers, a digital revolution in fabrication will 
        allow anyone to make almost anything, anywhere.
            (4) These creations include elements of a typical household 
        basket of goods (furnishings, apparel, food production 
        equipment, shelter, transportation, education and 
        communication, recreation, and other goods and services), 
        personal technology, means for personal expression, the 
        production of digital fabrication machinery, community design, 
        and manufacturing capability.
            (5) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the Massachusetts 
        Institute of Technology (CBA) has contributed significantly to 
        the advancement of these goals through its work in creating and 
        advancing digital fabrication facilities, or ``fab labs'' in 
        the United States and abroad.
            (6) Such digital fabrication facilities may include 
        MakerSpaces, Hackerspaces, and other creative spaces that use 
        digital fabrication as a platform for education, innovation, 
        entrepreneurship, personal expression, public access, and 
        social impact.
            (7) Such digital fabrication facilities provide a model for 
        a new kind of national laboratory that operates as a network, 
        linking local facilities for advanced manufacturing, providing 
        universal access, cultivating new literacies, and empowering 
        communities.
            (8) The nonprofit Fab Foundation was established to support 
        the growth of the international network of digital fabrication 
        facilities, to amplify the educational, entrepreneurial, and 
        social impacts of digital fabrication facilities, and to 
        support the development of regional capacity building 
        organizations to broaden impact as well as address local, 
        regional, and global challenges through the use of digital 
        fabrication technologies.
            (9) A coordinated array of national public-private 
        partnerships will be the most effective way to accelerate the 
        provision of universal access to this infrastructure for 
        workforce development, science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics education, developing inventions, creating 
        businesses, producing personalized products, and mitigating 
        risks.

SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FAB LAB.

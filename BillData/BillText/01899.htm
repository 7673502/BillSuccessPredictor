    Subsection (a) of section 302 of the Controlled Substances Act (21

paragraph:
    ``(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the registration 
of any registrant under this title to manufacture, distribute, or 
dispense controlled substances or list I chemicals terminates if and 
when such registrant--
        ``(i) dies;
        ``(ii) ceases legal existence;
        ``(iii) discontinues business or professional practice; or
        ``(iv) surrenders such registration.

or discontinues business or professional practice, such registrant 
shall promptly notify the Attorney General in writing of such fact.

such conditions as the Attorney General may specify and then only 
pursuant to written consent. A registrant to whom a registration is 
assigned or transferred pursuant to the preceding sentence may not 
manufacture, distribute, or dispense controlled substances or list I 
chemicals pursuant to such registration until the Attorney General 
receives such written consent.

distribute, or dispense controlled substances or list I chemicals 
desiring to discontinue business or professional practice altogether or 
with respect to controlled substances and list I chemicals (without 
assigning or transferring such business or professional practice to 
another entity), such registrant shall return to the Attorney General 
for cancellation--
        ``(i) the registrant's certificate of registration;
        ``(ii) any unexecuted order forms in the registrant's 
    possession; and

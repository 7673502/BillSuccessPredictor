                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the importation into, or transit through, the United States 
 of any mineral, or product produced with minerals, from Afghanistan, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Terrorist Minerals Trade 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Funds derived from the sale of minerals in Afghanistan 
        will be used by the Taliban and its allies to finance terrorist 
        and military activities, overthrow legitimate governments, 
        subvert international efforts to promote peace and stability, 
        and commit horrifying atrocities against unarmed civilians.
            (2) The United States spent 20 years and two trillion 
        dollars to attempt to bring peace and international comity to 
        Afghanistan, only to see the Taliban supported by other 
        international actors overthrow the legal government in a matter 
        of hours.
            (3) The United States spent tens of millions of dollars 
        funding critical mineral surveys and mineral exploration to 
        help build an alternative economy for the legitimate peaceful 
        Government of Afghanistan and that data has now fallen into the 
        hands of the Taliban and its allies.
            (4) Prohibiting the Taliban and its allies from profiting 
        from the use of these mineral resources will ensure that 
        threats to international peace and security posed by the 
        Taliban will not be funded with these minerals.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act:
            (1) Mineral.--The term ``mineral'' means any mined 
        material.
            (2) United states.--The term ``United States'', when used 
        in the geographic sense, means the several States, the District

            (3) United states person.--The term ``United States

            ``(8) within the exclusive economic zone, large-scale 
        driftnet fishing that deploys nets with large mesh sizes causes 
        significant entanglement and mortality of living marine 
        resources, including myriad protected species, despite 
        limitations on the lengths of such nets.''.
    (b) Policy.--Section 206(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery 
Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1826(c)) is amended--

            ``(4) prioritize the phase out of large-scale driftnet 
        fishing in the exclusive economic zone and promote the 
        development and adoption of alternative fishing methods and 
        gear types that minimize the incidental catch of living marine 
        resources.''.

SEC. 4. TRANSITION PROGRAM.

                fishery, if such permit is surrendered for permanent 
                revocation, and such permit holder relinquishes any

                incidental catch of living marine resources, if the 
                fishery participant is authorized to continue fishing 
                using such alternative gears.
            ``(3) Certification.--The Secretary shall certify that, 
        with respect to each participant in the program under this 
        subsection, any permit authorizing participation in a large-
        scale driftnet fishery has been permanently revoked and that no 
        new permits will be issued to authorize such fishing.''.

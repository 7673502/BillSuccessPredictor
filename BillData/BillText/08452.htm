                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Public Health Service Act to authorize grants to eligible 
entities to pay for travel-related expenses and logistical support for 
individuals with respect to accessing abortion services, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) On June 24, 2022, in its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson 
        Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. 
        Wade, reversing decades of precedent recognizing the 
        constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy.
            (2) The abortion access landscape was already strained. 
        This decision will decimate access for millions of people in 
        the United States. Roughly half of States are predicted to ban 
        or severely restrict abortion in the coming months.
            (3) The implications of this decision will fall hardest on 
        people who already face barriers to health care access, 
        particularly Black people, Indigenous people, and other people 
        of color, people with disabilities, people in rural areas, 
        young people, people with documentation barriers, and those 
        having difficulty making ends meet.
            (4) People have always had abortions and always will, even 
        in the face of legal, financial, and logistical barriers, or 
        criminalization. While some will self-manage their abortions, 
        and have the option of using pills that are medically safe and 
        effective, many others are traveling hundreds of miles out of 
        State, or forced to carry pregnancies to term.
            (5) Abortion funds and practical support funds are 
        community-based organizations that support people in overcoming 
        financial and logistical barriers to abortion care.
            (6) Funds work together to remove financial and logistical 
        barriers to abortion access and have been doing this work for 
        years. Some of these barriers are, but are not limited to, 
        transportation, food, lodging, childcare, translation, and 
        doula services.
            (7) Many funds are led by people who have had abortions 
        themselves, including a growing base of Black and Brown leaders 
        who have themselves faced abortion obstacles and understand the 
        complex circumstances callers may face.
            (8) Abortion funds have a history of being underresourced 
        and rely mostly on volunteer time and energy to support 
        communities.
            (9) Abortion and practical support funds hold some of the 
        closest ties to people who are having abortions and have the 
        first-hand experience, up-to-date and on-the-ground knowledge, 
        and the regional and national connections needed to support 
        abortion seekers financially, emotionally, or logistically.
            (10) Clinics in States where abortion is legal and more 
        accessible are receiving an influx of people seeking abortions. 
        Provider shortages plus this rapid increase in patients will 
        cause longer waits for appointments.
            (11) When people are not able to access an abortion when 
        they need it, they are often pushed much further into 
        pregnancy. This increases costs exponentially. For many, the 
        increased financial burden will push abortion care completely 
        out of reach.
            (12) A rapidly changing access landscape, as bans are 
        implemented and challenged, means that the window to access 
        care in certain States may be limited. People who are put in a 
        position where they must postpone their care due to financial 
        or other constraints may face appointment cancellations due to 
        overnight changes in legality.
            (13) Funds often work with each other if they cannot fully 
        assist a caller, or if a caller is traveling across regions. A 
        national network of almost 100 abortion and practical support 
        funds has demonstrated these funds are uniquely positioned to 
        lead in this moment and need support.

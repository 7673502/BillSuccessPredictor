                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a program of 
    research regarding the risks posed by the presence of dioxins, 
 phthalates, pesticides, chemical fragrances, and other components of 
             menstrual products and intimate care products.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Robin Danielson Menstrual Product 
and Intimate Care Product Safety Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Menstrual products and intimate care products are 
        widely used in the United States today, but there is not enough 
        research on the safety of or potential chemical exposure from 
        components of these products.
            (2) People who menstruate may be exposed to substances in 
        tampons and other menstrual products for as long as 40 years 
        over the course of their reproductive lives. The average person 
        who menstruates may use up to 16,000 tampons in their lifetime.
            (3) Trace amounts of dioxins can be found in tampons and 
        other menstrual products. The Environmental Protection Agency 
        and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, an arm of 
        the World Health Organization, have concluded that dioxins are 
        a probable human carcinogen (cancer-causing agent).
            (4) Chemical testing of menstrual products from around the 
        world have detected several additional chemicals of concern 
        including phthalates, volatile organic compounds, pesticides, 
        carbon disulfide, and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
        (PFAS).
            (5) Intimate care products frequently contain undisclosed 
        fragrance chemicals, some of which may be allergens, 
        reproductive toxins, and carcinogens. Such products also 
        contain potentially harmful preservatives. Research released by 
        Apothercare, Women's Voices for the Earth, and Black Women for 
        Wellness found that some intimate care products specifically 
        inhibit the growth of lactobacillus, a crucial type of healthy 
        bacteria found in the vaginal microbiome. Disruption of the 
        vaginal microbiome can lead to significant health problems 
        including bacterial vaginosis, increased risk of sexually 
        transmitted diseases, and fertility concerns.
            (6) Intimate care products (especially douches and powders) 
        have been associated with higher levels of toxic chemicals in 
        the bodies of people who use them. Specifically, phthalate 
        levels in urine were significantly higher in people who douche 
        frequently. Another study found significantly higher levels of 
        1,4-dichlorobenzene in the blood of people who douche 
        frequently and higher levels of ethylbenzene in the blood of 
        intimate powder users.
            (7) Research regarding the presence of chemicals in 
        menstrual products and intimate care products plays a role in 
        advancing health equity for populations that have historically 
        experienced health disparities, including Black people.
            (8) Regulatory oversight of the safety of materials in 
        menstrual and intimate care products is limited. The Food and 
        Drug Administration has historically relied on data provided by 
        manufacturers of menstrual products in determining product 
        safety. Intimate care products generally do not need approval 
        by the Food and Drug Administration before they go on the 
        market, and manufacturers have the responsibility to ensure the 
        safety of their products.

SEC. 3. RESEARCH ON DIOXINS AND OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL COMPONENTS OF 
              MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AND INTIMATE CARE PRODUCTS.

    Part F of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 287d 
et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section:

``SEC. 486C. RESEARCH ON DIOXINS AND OTHER POTENTIALLY HARMFUL 
              COMPONENTS OF MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS AND INTIMATE CARE 
              PRODUCTS.

    ``(a) Research.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Director of NIH shall provide for 
        the conduct or support of research to determine the extent to 
        which the presence of dioxins, phthalates, titanium dioxide, 
        and other components (including contaminants and substances 
        used as fragrances, colorants, dyes, and preservatives) in 
        tampons and other menstrual products and intimate care 
        products--
                    ``(A) poses any risks to the health of people who 
                use the products, including risks related to 
                gynecologic, breast, and other cancers, endometriosis, 
                infertility and pregnancy outcomes, immune system 
                deficiencies, pelvic inflammatory disease, toxic shock 
                syndrome, the health of the vaginal microbiome, and 
                other bacterial and yeast infections; and
                    ``(B) poses any risks to the health of children or 
                people who used such products during or before the 
                pregnancies involved, including risks related to fetal 
                and childhood development.
            ``(2) Definition.--For purposes of paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) the term `menstrual products' means tampons, 
                pads, liners, cups, sponges, and similar products used 
                by people who menstruate with respect to menstruation 
                or other genital-tract secretions; and
                    ``(B) the term `intimate care products' means 
                douches, wipes, sprays, washes, powders, and similar 
                products used with respect to vulva or vaginal 
                cleansing.
    ``(b) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of carrying 
out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as 
may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2023 through 2027.''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

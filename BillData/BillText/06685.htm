    Section 302(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 
10222(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(7) In determining the order in which the Secretary will accept 
high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel for disposal or 
storage, the Secretary shall prioritize high-level radioactive waste or 
spent nuclear fuel from a civilian nuclear power reactor based on the 
operating status of the civilian nuclear power reactor, the population 
of the area in which the civilian nuclear power reactor is located, the 
earthquake hazard of the area in which the civilian nuclear power 
reactor is located, and national security risk related to the continued 
storage of high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel in the 
area in which the civilian nuclear power reactor is located, giving 
highest priority to a civilian nuclear power reactor that is--
            ``(A) decommissioned or decommissioning;
            ``(B) located in an area, as determined by the Secretary, 
        the population of which is the largest;
            ``(C) located in an area with the highest hazard of an 
        earthquake, as indicated by the Seismic Hazard Maps published 
        by the Director of the United States Geological Survey pursuant 
        to section 5(b)(3)(J) of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act 
        of 1977; and
            ``(D) located in an area, as determined by the Secretary 
        (in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the 
        Secretary of Homeland Security), where the continued storage of 
        high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel poses a 
        significant national security concern.''.

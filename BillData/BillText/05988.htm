    (a) Gain-of-Function Research Definition.--In this section, the 
term ``gain-of-function research'' means any research that--
            (1) may be reasonably anticipated to confer attributes to

        enhanced pathogenicity or transmissibility in any organism; or
            (2) involves the enhancement of potential pandemic 
        pathogens or related risky research with potentially dangerous 
        pathogens.
    (b) Funding Limitations.--

        law, no Federal funding may be made available for any purpose, 
        including under any contract, grant, subgrant, or other 
        assistance, to laboratories or research institutions in the 
        People's Republic of China for the purposes of gain-of-function 
        research.
            (2) Certification.--Any recipient of Federal funding for 
        the purposes of scientific research shall certify to the 
        issuing authority that such recipient will not distribute any 
        such Federal funds, whether directly or through subgrants, to 
        any qualifying laboratory or research institution that is in 
        the People's Republic of China or that receives any funding 
        from the People's Republic of China, for the purposes of gain-
        of-function research.
    (c) Penalty for Lack of Candor.--With respect to any official or 
employee of the National Institutes of Health, or grantee or employee 
or contractor of a grantee of the National Institutes of Health, who is 
determined by the Inspector General of the Department of Health and

relevant Inspector General about the direction, scope, or extent of 
Federal funding of international gain-of-function research, in addition 
to being subject to all other applicable criminal penalties--
            (1) such person shall not be eligible for any new Federal 
        grant or other funding;
            (2) if such person previously received a Federal grant or 
        other funding, such grant or other funding shall be immediately

            (1) the United States capacity to determine the extent of 
        gain-of-function research conducted by any laboratories of 
        research institutions in the People's Republic of China, 
        including the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and safety protocols 
        followed by laboratories or research institutions in the 
        People's Republic of China, including the Wuhan Institute of 
        Virology, in conducting any gain-of-function research;
            (2) the United States capacity to determine whether

        of-function research and the People's Liberation Army exist;
            (3) costs and potential risks or benefits of any United

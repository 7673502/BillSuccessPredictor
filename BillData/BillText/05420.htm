To provide for the continued payment of social security benefits during 
                       lapses in appropriations.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``All Seniors Always Paid (ASAP) Too 
Act''.

SEC. 2. CONTINUED PAYMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS DURING PERIODS OF 
              LAPSED APPROPRIATIONS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``social security benefits'' means monthly 
        insurance benefits payable under title II of the Social 
        Security Act.
            (2) The term ``period of lapsed appropriations'', when used 
        with respect to social security benefits, means any period 
        during which appropriations are not available due to the 
        absence of the timely enactment of any Act or joint resolution 
        (including any Act or joint resolution making continuing 
        appropriations) appropriating funds to administer the payment 
        of social security benefits.
    (b) Appropriation of Funds To Continue Payment of Social Security 
Benefits.--For any period of lapsed appropriations, there are 
appropriated, out of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust 
Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as appropriate, to the 
Commissioner of Social Security to allow the Commissioner to continue 
to administer the payment of social security benefits without 
interruption.
    (c) Effect of End of Period of Lapsed Appropriations.--Expenditures 
made for any fiscal year pursuant to this section shall be charged to 
the applicable appropriation whenever the regular appropriation bill 
(or other bill or joint resolution making continuing appropriations 
through the end of the fiscal year) becomes law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

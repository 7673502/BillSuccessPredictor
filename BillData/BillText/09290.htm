        with the Secretaries of the military departments, shall develop 
        and implement uniform standards applicable to the military 
        criminal investigative organizations of the Department of

                    (A) establish processes and procedures for the 
                handling of cold cases;
                    (B) specify the circumstances under which a case 
                overseen by such an organization shall be referred to

                review; and
                    (C) establish procedures to ensure that, in the 
                event an investigator transfers out of such an 
                organization or otherwise ceases to be an investigator, 
                the cases overseen by such investigator are transferred 
                to a new investigator within the organization.
            (2) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act the Secretary of Defense shall submit to

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To protect against seasonal and pandemic influenza, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting America from Seasonal and 
Pandemic Influenza Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Influenza occurs seasonally each year, and throughout 
        history has caused devastating pandemics. The 1918 influenza 
        pandemic killed an estimated 675,000 Americans.
            (2) In an average season, influenza results in 12,000 to 
        52,000 deaths in the United States, including over 100 
        pediatric deaths. Additionally, influenza causes hundreds of 
        thousands of hospitalizations and millions of illnesses.
            (3) The Council of Economic Advisors issued a report in 
        2019 estimating that seasonal influenza costs the United States 
        approximately $361,000,000,000 per year, and that an influenza 
        pandemic has the potential to cause up to $3,790,000,000,000 in 
        losses. This report was issued prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
        which will cost the United States an estimated 
        $16,000,000,000,000.
            (4) Most funding for pandemic influenza preparedness up 
        until fiscal year 2018 was derived from supplemental 
        appropriations that dated back to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
            (5) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in this 
        preamble referred to as the ``CDC'') studies of influenza 
        hospitalization rates by race and ethnicity during 10 influenza 
        seasons from 2009 to 2019 showed that people from racial and 
        ethnic minority groups are at higher risk for being 
        hospitalized with influenza.
            (6) The COVID-19 pandemic response has been built on the 
        pandemic influenza response ecosystem.
            (7) Strategies that increase seasonal influenza vaccination 
        rates will also improve pandemic readiness.
            (8) The National Influenza Vaccine Modernization Strategy 
        of 2020-2030 of the Department of Health and Human Services 
        should be implemented as quickly as possible to ensure the 
        Nation's vaccine enterprise is highly responsive, flexible, 
        scalable, and effective at reducing the impact of seasonal and 
        pandemic influenza viruses.
            (9) Influenza surveillance has been improved significantly 
        over the last several years by deploying next-generation gene 
        sequencing tools to analyze circulating influenza viruses. The 
        technology allows the CDC to study more influenza viruses 
        faster and in more detail, and to monitor genetic changes in 
        influenza viruses to better understand and improve the 
        effectiveness of influenza vaccines.
            (10) Vaccine hesitancy in the United States has reached a 
        tipping point where it is adversely affecting public health. 
        Misinformation is widely available on social media, and 
        traditional sources of information on the value and efficacy of 
        vaccines are not trusted by many Americans, especially those 
        who are vaccine hesitant.
            (11) Support for vaccine communication, outreach, and 
        administration across public health and health care settings is 
        critical to drive demand of influenza vaccines, treatments, and 
        medical countermeasures and ensure equitable uptake of these 
        innovations.

SEC. 3. STRENGTHENING AND DIVERSIFYING INFLUENZA VACCINE DEVELOPMENT, 
              MANUFACTURING, AND SUPPLY CHAIN.

        influenza strain with pandemic potential.
            (2) Plan.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and

SEC. 4. PROMOTING INNOVATIVE APPROACHES AND USE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO 
              DETECT, PREVENT, AND RESPOND TO INFLUENZA.

    (a) Expanded Genomic Sequencing.--
            (1) Grants.--The Director of the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention may award grants to State and local 
        laboratories, academic research institutions, and other private 
        entities to expand genomic sequencing.
            (2) Sources of data.--The sequencing supported pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) may rely on multiple sources of data, including 
        human, animal, plant, and environmental data necessary to track 
        zoonotic diseases.
    (b) Centers of Excellence in Genomic Epidemiology.--The Director of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may--
            (1) designate Centers of Excellence in Genomic 
        Epidemiology; and
            (2) award grants to such Centers of Excellence to establish 
        and implement partnerships between State and local health 
        departments and academic institutions to improve genomic 
        epidemiology, including through the conduct or support of 
        research.
    (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should support interoperable 
immunization information systems that enable bidirectional data 
exchange among States, localities, and community immunization 
providers.
    (d) Prioritizing Influenza and Pathogen Agnostic Tools.--
            (1) NIH.--The Director of the National Institutes of Health 
        may conduct or support basic research prioritizing the

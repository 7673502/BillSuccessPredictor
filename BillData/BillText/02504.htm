  To provide to localities injured by the cancellation or relocation, 
without good cause, of a scheduled organized professional major league 
  team competition by a league of organized professional major league 
              baseball teams, or a member of such league.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Protection in Sports Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Events put on by organized professional major league 
        baseball leagues outside of the regular season of competition 
        provide unique economic benefits to local economies.
            (2) Localities must spend money in preparation for special 
        events that bring in thousands of visitors from across the 
        country and the world.
            (3) The cancellation or relocation of such events without 
        good cause results in a significant loss of revenue for local 
        businesses that would have otherwise benefited from hosting an 
        event.

SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL CONDUCT.

    It shall be unlawful for a league of organized professional major 
league baseball teams, or a member of such league, to cancel or 
relocate a team competition composed of 2 or more organized 
professional major league baseball teams if such competition is not 
part of the regular season competition schedule of such league and if 
the cancellation or relocations of such competition is not a reasonable 
response to--
            (1) a pandemic,
            (2) a natural disaster,
            (3) inclement weather, or
            (4) an emergency declared by the Federal Government or by 
        the State in which such competition is scheduled to occur 
        before the applicable cancellation or relocation.

SEC. 4. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION; CIVIL ACTION.

    (a) Liability.--A league of organized professional major league 
baseball teams, a member of such league, or both that cancel or 
relocate a team competition in violation of section 3 shall be liable 
to the locality injured by such violation.
    (b) Civil Action.--A locality that is injured by a violation of 
section 3 may commence a civil action for damages in an appropriate 
district court of the United States, or in a State court of competent 
jurisdiction, within 4 years after the cause of action accrues.

SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

    For purposes of this Act:
            (1) Locality.--The term ``locality'' means a county, 
        parish, city, town, township, village, or other general purpose 
        political subdivision of a State with the power to levy taxes 
        and to expend Federal, State, and local funds and exercise 
        governmental powers.
            (2) State.--The term ``State'' means a State, the District

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
 To require the Administrator of General Services to transfer certain 
   surplus computers and technology equipment to nonprofit computer 
   refurbishers for repair, distribution, and return, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Computers for Veterans and 
Students Act of 2022'' or the ``COVS Act''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress finds the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Access to computers and computer technology is 
        indispensable for success in the 21st century. Millions of 
        Americans do not regularly use a computer and research shows 
        that substantial disparities remain in both internet use and 
        the quality of access with the digital divide concentrated 
        among older, less educated, less affluent populations, 
        especially veterans, low-income students, and senior 
        citizens.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the gap 
        between those with computer access and those without. Millions 
        of students, their families, and workers from across the 
        economy were unable to do schoolwork, work remotely from home, 
        or connect to loved ones and their communities because of the 
        digital divide.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Any Federal program that distributes surplus 
        Federal computers to a public school, an educational nonprofit, 
        or a nonprofit computer refurbisher for repair and distribution 
        would benefit from a partnership with a nonprofit organization, 
        whose mission is bridging the digital divide.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. REFURBISHMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF SURPLUS COMPUTERS 
              AND TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) GSA Transfer.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after 
        State agencies for surplus property have been given an 
        opportunity to review surplus computer or technology equipment 
        that has been determined to be repairable, the Administrator 
        shall transfer to participating nonprofit computer refurbishers 
        such equipment with full title to such equipment, for repair 
        and distribution in accordance with subsection 
        (c)(1).&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Information on equipment refurbished.--A 
        nonprofit computer refurbisher that receives surplus computer 
        or technology equipment under this subsection shall provide the 
        Administrator with any information the Administrator determines 
        to be necessary for required reporting, including information 
        about the distribution of such equipment.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Partnership.--The Administrator may establish a 
partnership with non-governmental entities, at no cost, to--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) facilitate the identification of nonprofit 
        computer refurbishers and the distribution of surplus computer 
        or technology equipment under this section; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) facilitate the participation of nonprofit 
        computer refurbishers under this section.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Repair and Distribution.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Distribution to bridge the digital divide.--A 
        nonprofit computer refurbisher that receives equipment under 
        subsection (a) shall repair and distribute such equipment to an 
        educational institution, a veteran, an individual with a 
        disability, a low-income individual, a student, or a senior in 
        need that is residing or based in the United States.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Training programs.--Any nonprofit computer 
        refurbisher that receives any equipment under subsection (a) 
        shall offer training programs on the use of computers and 
        technology equipment for any of the following:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) Educational institutions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) Veterans.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                disabilities.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) Low-income individuals.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (F) Seniors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Reports Required.--Not later than 1 year after the 
date of the enactment of this Act, and every 2 years thereafter for the 
next 4 years, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on 
the efforts of the Administrator under this Act.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (e) Agency Reports.--Not later than 5 years after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the head of each 
Federal agency shall make a report available to the public on the 
number of repairable computers that were sent to recycling, abandoned, 
or destroyed.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be 
construed to supersede the requirements of the Stevenson-Wydler 
Technology Innovation Act of 1980 (Public Law 96-480; 15 U.S.C. 3701 et

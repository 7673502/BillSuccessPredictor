    Section 15(g) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(g)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(4) Limitation on credit for meeting contracting goals.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A Federal agency may allocate 
                credit for a single prime contract not more than two 
                times for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the 
                Governmentwide goals established under paragraph 
                (1)(A).
                    ``(B) Allocation of credit.--The first allocation 
                of credit described in subparagraph (A) shall be 
                applied toward the goal described in paragraph 
                (1)(A)(i). A second allocation of such credit shall be 
                applied as follows:
                            ``(i) If the prime contract was awarded 
                        pursuant to a requirement to set aside such 
                        prime contract for a small business concern 
                        described in clause (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v) 
                        of paragraph (1)(A), the credit shall be 
                        applied toward the goal described in the 
                        appropriate clause that corresponds with the 
                        award.
                            ``(ii) If the prime contract was not 
                        awarded pursuant to a requirement to set aside 
                        such prime contract for a small business 
                        concern described in clause (ii), (iii), (iv), 
                        or (v) of paragraph (1)(A), the credit shall be 
                        applied toward any applicable goal described in 
                        such paragraph (1)(A).
                    ``(C) Credit defined.--In this paragraph, the term 
                `credit' means the value of a prime contract.''.

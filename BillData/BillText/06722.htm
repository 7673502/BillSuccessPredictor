United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) Richard A. Pittman was born on May 26, 1945, in French 
    Camp, California.
        (2) Richard A. Pittman enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1965 and 
    was later promoted to Lance Corporal.
        (3) On July 24, 1966, Lance Corporal Pittman's unit, First 
    Platoon, Company I, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, was moving 
    along a trail near the Demilitarized Zone in the Republic of 
    Vietnam when the Marines ahead of them came under attack.
        (4) Upon hearing the attack, Lance Corporal Pittman took a 
    machine gun and several belts of ammunition and rushed to aid his 
    comrades. As he advanced, Lance Corporal Pittman encountered 
    intense small-arms fire at point-blank range. He was able to return 
    fire and silence the enemy combatants. Continuing towards the 
    attacked Marines, Lance Corporal Pittman came under heavy fire from 
    two automatic weapons, which he was able to destroy.
        (5) When Lance Corporal Pittman learned there were additional 
    wounded Marines further along the trail, he endured enemy mortar 
    and gunfire to get to them. As he reached them, he faced an attack 
    by 30 to 40 enemy fighters.
        (6) Lance Corporal Pittman used a combination of machine-gun 
    fire, an enemy submachine gun, a pistol from a fallen comrade, and 
    a grenade to cause enemy forces to withdraw. Due to his courageous 
    actions, many of his wounded comrades were saved.
        (7) In recognition of his bravery that day, Richard A. Pittman, 
    who was then a Sergeant, was awarded the Medal of Honor by 
    President Lyndon B. Johnson on May 14, 1968.
        (8) Richard A. Pittman retired in 1988 as a Master Sergeant, 
    after having served in the Marine Corps for more than two decades.

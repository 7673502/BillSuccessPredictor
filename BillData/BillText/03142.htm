        treated as an IRIC.

                meet the requirements of subsection (a) for any taxable 
                year shall nevertheless be considered to have satisfied 
                the requirements of such subsection for such taxable 
                year if--
                            ``(i) the failure was due to reasonable 
                        cause and not due to willful neglect,
                            ``(ii) no later than 30 days after the 
                        discovery of the event causing such failure, 
                        the corporation meets the requirements of

                        the requirements of subsection (a)(3) for any 
                        period, the failure was caused by persons not 
                        described therein holding, in the aggregate, 
                        less than 1 percent of the stock (by value) of 
                        the corporation, and

        application of any treaty) would be subject to tax under 
        section 871(a) if received by a nonresident alien individual,

        sections 998(a)(3) and 998A(b)(2)(A), a corporation may rely on 
        the certification of its shareholders, unless or until such 
        time that the corporation has reason to know that the 
        certification is false or is no longer true.
            ``(2) Redemption upon false certification.--If a 
        corporation has reason to know that the certification made by 
        one of its shareholders is false or is no longer true, the 
        corporation must redeem the stock held by such shareholder as 
        soon as reasonably practicable (and in no case more than 30 
        days after the corporation obtains such reason to know). 
        Failure to redeem such stock in a timely manner shall result in 
        the corporation failing the requirement of section 998(a)(3) or 
        998A(b)(2)(A), whichever is applicable.
            ``(3) Certification by certain institutions.--For purposes 
        of this subsection, a certification with regard to a person 
        which is made by an institution described in section 
        871(h)(5)(B) in a form satisfactory to the Secretary under 
        section 871(h) shall be deemed to be a certification by such

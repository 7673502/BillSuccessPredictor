                                 A BILL


 
 To make any individual who is demonstrated to have antibodies to the 
    virus that causes COVID-19 exempt from any Federal mandate for 
                     vaccination against COVID-19.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Follow Accepted Science Together Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The National Institutes of Health reported in March, 
        2021, that ``people who have had evidence of a prior infection 
        with SARS-CoV-2 . . . appear to be well protected against being 
        reinfected with the virus . . .''. The study stated, ``the data 
        from this study suggest that people who have had a positive 
        result from a commercial antibody test appear to have 
        substantial immunity to SARS-CoV-2 which means they are at a 
        lower risk for future infection''.
            (2) The National Institutes of Health reported in January 
        2021, that ``after people recover from infection with a virus, 
        the immune system retains a memory of it. Immune cells and 
        proteins that circulate in the body can recognize and kill the 
        pathogen if it's encountered again, protecting against disease 
        and reducing illness severity. All of these immune system 
        components have been found in people who recover from SARS-CoV-
        2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Researchers found durable 
        immune responses in the majority of people studied.''.
            (3) A study at Emory University in July 2021, found that 
        recovered COVID-19 patients retain broad and effective longer-
        term immunity to the disease. The study looked at 254 patients 
        with mild to moderate symptoms over a period of eight months 
        and found that their immune response to the virus remained 
        durable and strong.
            (4) Patient and doctor relationships should always be 
        paramount and forefront in each patient's life.
            (5) Religious, mental health, physical health, immune 
        health, and other exemptions from vaccination requirements give 
        patients and doctors the flexibility to adapt to the 
        limitations or prerequisites of a patient's health.

SEC. 3. INAPPLICABILITY OF ANY COVID-19 VACCINE MANDATE TO INDIVIDUALS 
              WITH ANTIBODIES.

    Any individual who is demonstrated to have antibodies to the virus 
that causes COVID-19 shall be exempt from any Federal mandate for 
vaccination against COVID-19.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

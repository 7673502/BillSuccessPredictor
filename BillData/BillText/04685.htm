carry out a study on the impact of the gamification, psychological 
nudges, and other design techniques of online trading platforms, 
including the following:
            (1) How, and to what extent gamification, psychological 
        nudges, and other design techniques are being used by online 
        platforms in ways that are detrimental to investors.
            (2) How, and to what extent gamification, psychological 
        nudges, and other design techniques are being used by online 
        platforms in ways that empower, inform, and educate investors.
            (3) The various ways brokers use gamification, 
        psychological nudges, and other design techniques in marketing 
        strategies that attempt to attract retail customers.
            (4) The various ways investment advisers or ``robo-

        design techniques in marketing strategies that target or 
        include retail customers.
            (5) The various ways in which brokers, investment advisers,

        designs in their online trading applications used by retail 
        customers.
            (6) Whether certain platform use of gamification, 
        psychological nudges, and other design techniques, including

            (7) A comparison between the investment activity, habits,

                gamification, psychological nudges, and other design

                like'' features and designs in their online trading 
                applications; and
                    (B) retail customers of firms that do not use, or 
                have limited use of, gamification, psychological 
                nudges, and other design techniques in marketing and 
                that do not incorporate ``game-like'' features and 
                designs in their online trading applications.
            (8) How, and how prominently, brokers, investment advisers 
        or ``robo-advisers'' that use gamification, psychological 
        nudges, and other design techniques in marketing strategies 
        that target or include retail investors, or that incorporate 
        ``game-like'' features and designs in their online trading 
        applications, are disclosing the risks associated with 
        leverage, complex products, or excessive or frequent trading.
            (9) The various customer demographic categories (including 
        age, net worth, and investment experience) of brokers or 
        investment advisers, or ``robo-advisers'' that use

        designs in their online trading applications.

        susceptibility to ``game-like'' features.
            (11) The degree to which the types of retail trading 
        activity that is incentivized by gamification (including the 
        specific asset classes promoted via gamification) benefits, 
        harms, or otherwise affects other market participants, and an 
        analysis thereof.
            (12) The degree to which Securities and Exchange 
        Commission's Form BD and Form ADV can be revised to help the

        gamification, psychological nudges, and other design 
        techniques.

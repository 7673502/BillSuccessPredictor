                                 A BILL


 
   To designate a peak in the State of Washington as ``q\w\45tmayqn-
                      9istiqayu9-Mount Cleator''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Oral history from the Wenatchi band of the Confederated 
        Tribes of the Colville Reservation and from the Sauk-Suiattle 
        Indian Tribe identifies the traditional Native American names 
        for the 7,630-foot peak located at latitude 48.11516 N, 
        longitude 120.94636 W, in what is now the Glacier Peak 
        Wilderness in the State of Washington, as ``q\w\45tmayqn'' and 
        ``9istiqayu9'' in the languages of the Wenatchi and Sauk-
        Suiattle peoples, respectively, both meaning ``Wolverine 
        Head''.
            (2) These names derive from a Wenatchi (snL4sq\w\aMs4x\w\) 
        creation story involving a battle between a wolverine and a 
        grizzly bear over the love of a spruce grouse, or fool hen.
            (3) The culture and economy of both the Wenatchi 
        (snL4sq\w\aMs4x\w\) and Sauk-Suiattle (Sa9q\w\4bix\w\-
        SuyaN9bix\w\) people centered around fishing, but they also 
        gathered roots and berries and hunted game in the surrounding 
        mountains.
            (4) The Wenatchi and Sauk-Suiattle people have a long 
        history of interaction and intermarriage that connected the 
        Northwest Coastal Salish and the Plateau Salish peoples.
            (5) During the twentieth century, the peak informally came 
        to be known as ``Mount Cleator'' in recognition of Frederick W. 
        ``Fred'' Cleator, an early employee of the United States Forest 
        Service who surveyed and assisted in the establishment of 
        national forests and trail systems in the Pacific Northwest and 
        was one of the Service's first recreational planners.
            (6) Cleator is credited with establishing the Oregon 
        Skyline Trail, a 350-mile trail in the Oregon Cascades, and the 
        Cascade Crest Trail, a 500-mile trail in the State of 
        Washington. Both trails formed the basis for the Pacific Crest 
        National Scenic Trail in Oregon and Washington.
            (7) In the late 1920s, Cleator named and began the 
        development of the Cascade Crest Trail in Washington and, by 
        the mid-1930s, his team had mapped the 450-mile trail and begun 
        construction.
            (8) During his 35-year Forest Service career, Cleator 
        surveyed the Olympic, Wenatchee, and Chelan national forests 
        and held positions in the Wenatchee and Colville National 
        Forests and in what is today the Forest Service's Northwest 
        Regional Office in Portland, Oregon.

              STATE OF WASHINGTON

months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal 
Acquisition Regulatory Council shall--
            (1) expand the scope of rules to prevent personal conflicts 
        of interest beyond the limited types of functions or services 
        that are currently addressed in subpart 3.11 of the Federal 
        Acquisition Regulation, by including coverage for--
                    (A) consulting, analytical, or advisory services 
                supporting the primary missions, or services supporting 
                the regulatory, policymaking, and adjudicative

                governmental functions, as defined in the Federal 
                Acquisition Regulation, that give rise to heightened 
                concerns for personal conflicts of interest; and
                    (C) other functions or services that give rise to 
                heightened concerns for personal conflicts of interest, 
                as deemed appropriate; and
            (2) revise the Federal Acquisition Regulation to address

                for Executive agencies to use in solicitations and 
                contracts, where appropriate, to prevent personal 
                conflicts of interest;
                    (C) the responsibilities of employers to screen 
                their employees for personal conflicts of interest, to 
                inform their employees of their legal duties related to 
                preventing personal conflicts of interest and the 
                appearance of personal conflicts of interest, and to 
                seek compliance from their employees of such procedures 
                and requirements;
                    (D) the restrictions on a contractor's employees 
                disclosing, or using for personal gain, confidential

                contract; and
                    (E) the duties and procedures of reporting apparent 
                violations of rules governing personal conflicts of 
                interest, including to the agency's Inspector General,

                        officer's representative as soon as it is 
                        identified;

                        before, on, or after the effective date.

        contractor, employees, or subcontractor provides services to an 
        entity regulated by, or having non-routine business before, the 
        agency.

                paragraph (1) with respect to a contractor, employee, 
                or subcontractor only if the head of the agency 
                determines in writing there is a compelling reason to 
                award a contract, or continue performance of a 
                contract, with such exception.
                    ``(B) Determination.--In determining whether there 
                is a compelling reason under subparagraph (A), the head

        a conflict of interest, without receiving the written approval 
        of the contracting officer before the execution of the 
        contractual arrangement.
    ``(c) Civil Penalties.--
            ``(1) Civil action.--The Attorney General may bring a civil 
        action in an appropriate district court of the United States 
        against a person who knowingly violates the prohibitions under 
        subsection (a) or fails to comply with the requirements of

                the individual received under the corresponding 
                Government contract; and

                compensation that the organization received under the 
                corresponding Government contract.
            ``(3) Statute of limitation.--A civil action under 
        paragraph (1) shall be brought within 6 years after the later 
        of the date on which--

                of action occurred; or

                reasonably have known that the prohibited conduct had 
                occurred.

        in this subsection are not exclusive and do not limit the 
        potential for a person that violates the prohibitions under

        subsection (b), to be found liable under the False Claims Act,

        conflict of interest, as defined in the Federal Acquisition 
        Regulation, or has violated the prohibitions under subsection 
        (a) or fails to comply with the requirements of subsection (b),

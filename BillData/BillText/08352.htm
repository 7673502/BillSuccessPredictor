                        high health risks or impacts, the Administrator 
                        shall--
                                    (I) cease to include that source in 
                                the list under subparagraph (A); and
                                    (II) include instead an additional 
                                major source or area source described 
                                in subparagraph (A)(ii) to ensure that 
                                the list under subparagraph (A) 
                                includes not less than 100 high-

                                or other reliable information, that the 
                                substitution is likely to ensure that 
                                monitoring under this section occurs at 
                                the sources causing or contributing to 
                                the highest potential health risks or 
                                other impacts from hazardous air

                        Administrator determines that the source is, or 
                        is likely to be, contributing local health 
                        risks or impacts that are equivalent to, or 
                        greater than, those of the source for which the 
                        new source is being substituted.
            (2) Criteria.--The Administrator may include a major source 
        or area source described in clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) on 
        the list described in that paragraph only if the source--

        public health or welfare.
    (c) Determination of Best Available Form of Monitoring.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with 
        the Office of Air and Radiation, the Office of Enforcement and 
        Compliance Assurance, the Office of Environmental Justice, and 
        the Office of Research and Development, shall, for purposes of 
        the regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection (a)--
                    (A) determine the best available form of emissions 
                measurement, including continuous emissions monitoring 
                and fenceline monitoring; and
                    (B) ensure the methods required under the 
                regulations are at least as stringent as the most 
                current Environmental Protection Agency-approved or 
                promulgated emission test or monitoring method, 
                including Methods 325A, 325B, and TO-15 (or the most 
                current and best available version of such methods 
                approved or promulgated by the Environmental Protection 
                Agency).
            (2) Requirement.--In carrying out paragraph (1)(B), the 
        Administrator shall ensure that 1 or more of the methods 
        described in or promulgated under section 3 or subsection (d) 
        (including multimetal monitoring) is included in the 
        regulations promulgated pursuant to subsection (a) if that 
        method is the best available method for 1 or more of the 
        pollutants for which monitoring is required under this section.
    (d) Methods and Technologies.--
            (1) In general.--For all stationary sources in the source 
        categories described in subsection (b), as the best available 
        fenceline monitoring method for those source categories, the 
        Administrator may, in the regulations promulgated pursuant to 
        subsection (a)--
                    (A) require application, implementation, or 
                employment of optical remote sensing technology to 
                provide real-time measurements of air pollutant 
                concentrations along an open-path; or
                    (B) provide an explanation of why application, 
                implementation, or employment of 1 or more of the 
                technologies described in subparagraph (A) is not 
                necessary--
                            (i) to ensure compliance with the emission 
                        standards established under the regulations 
                        promulgated pursuant to subsection (d), (f), or

                        U.S.C. 7412), as applicable; or
                            (ii) to protect the public health, to 
                        prevent accidental releases, or to provide for 
                        effective emergency response.
            (2) Multiple-source or facility complexes.--
                    (A) Definition of multiple-source or facility 
                complex.--In this paragraph, the term ``multiple-source 
                or facility complex'' means 1 or more stationary 
                sources co-located at the same site.
                    (B) Multiple-source or facility complex 
                monitoring.--In the regulations promulgated pursuant to 
                subsection (a), the Administrator shall ensure that the 
                best available form of monitoring for a multiple-source 
                or facility complex that contains not less than 2 
                stationary sources in 1 or more of North American 
                Industry Classification System codes 324, 325, and 326, 
                or a related chemical or petrochemical sector, may be 
                at least a combination of--
                            (i) real-time, open-path monitoring; and
                            (ii) Method 325A and Method 325B.
                    (C) Requirement.--In carrying out subparagraph (B), 
                the Administrator may consider whether any other 
                multiple-source or facility complexes should be 
                required to employ the combined monitoring methods 
                described in that subparagraph.
    (e) Precautionary Approach.--In promulgating the corrective action 
level for each of the hazardous air pollutants described in subsection 
(a)(3), the Administrator shall--
            (1) consider the best available science;
            (2) take a precautionary approach to ensure that the owner 
        or operator of the source or facility reduces the emissions of 
        the source or facility to prevent harm if the measured 
        concentration at the fenceline would, or is likely to--
                    (A) increase harm to public health or safety 
                (including through an increased health risk); or
                    (B) reach a level that may result in short-term, 
                long-term, or chronic human exposure to air pollution 
                (including any fetal exposure that begins in utero) 
                that increases the risk of--
                            (i) health harms resulting from odors, 
                        irritation, sensitizing effects, or any 
                        combination of those harms;
                            (ii) disease (including cancer and other 
                        illnesses); or
                            (iii) death; and
            (3) take into account the aggregate and cumulative 
        emissions and health risks from the facility, including 
        multiple source categories, as applicable, to ensure full 
        health protection from the entire facility.
    (f) Maintenance and Public Reporting.--
            (1) In general.--In the regulations promulgated under 
        subsection (a), the Administrator shall ensure that--

                tracts or counties that the Administrator determines 
                should be prioritized for siting based on--
                            (i) the potential for the levels of 1 or 
                        more air pollutants to be monitored by the 
                        stations to reach or exceed the level of the 
                        applicable national ambient air quality 
                        standard established pursuant to section 109 of 
                        the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409);
                            (ii) the number of people who live, work, 
                        or recreate in the area or areas for which 
                        monitoring by the stations is reasonably 
                        anticipated to be representative with respect 
                        to air quality and the proportion of those 
                        people who are at higher risk than the general 
                        population of adverse health effects from the 
                        air pollutants monitored;
                            (iii) the lack or inadequacy of existing 
                        air quality monitors for providing 
                        representative air quality data for the 
                        affected area or areas for the pollutants to be 
                        measured by the station; and
                            (iv) the current designation of the area in 
                        which the monitoring station would be located 
                        as unclassifiable or attainment for one or more 
                        of the pollutants to be monitored by that 
                        station; and
                    (C) prior to making siting determinations--
                            (i) provide public notice of proposed 
                        siting locations--
                                    (I) in the Federal Register;
                                    (II) by email to persons who have 
                                requested notice of proposed siting 
                                determinations;
                                    (III) by news release; and
                                    (IV) by posting on the public 
                                website of the Environmental Protection 
                                Agency; and
                            (ii) provide an opportunity for public 
                        comment for not less than 30 days after the 
                        date of publication of the notice required 
                        under clause (i) in the Federal Register.
            (3) Reliance on hybrid methods.--In determining under 
        paragraph (2)(B)(i) the potential for an air pollutant to reach 
        or exceed the level of the applicable standard, the 
        Administrator may rely on hybrid methods that combine 
        information from multiple sources, including monitors, sensors, 
        modeling, and satellites.
    (e) Additional Ambient Monitors.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator shall deploy not fewer 
        than 100 Federal reference method monitors or Federal 
        equivalent method monitors for 1 or more air pollutants for 
        which national ambient air quality standards have been 
        established pursuant to section 109 of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7409) in areas--
                    (A) that are unmonitored or undermonitored, as 
                determined by the Administrator; and
                    (B) within which the Administrator determines, 
                after public notice and comment, that adding those 
                monitors is warranted--
                            (i) to detect whether the area is in 
                        nonattainment of the applicable national 
                        ambient air quality standards; and
                            (ii) to improve the publicly available data 
                        on air quality for 1 or more of those air 
                        pollutants (or precursors to those air 
                        pollutants).
            (2) Siting determinations.--In approving sites for new 
        Federal reference method monitors or Federal equivalent method 
        monitors required under this subsection, the Administrator 
        shall prioritize siting of the stations in census tracts or 
        counties in accordance with subsection (d)(2)(B).
            (3) Relation to previously deployed or planned monitors.--
        The Federal reference method monitors required under this 
        subsection shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any 
        monitors already deployed or planned for deployment by the 
        Administrator, any State, any other governmental entity, or any 
        other entity prior to the date of enactment of this Act.
    (f) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Administrator shall--
            (1) in coordination with the States, complete an 
        assessment, which includes public input, on the status of all 
        ambient air quality monitors that are part of Federal, State, 
        or local networks and used for determining compliance with 
        national ambient air quality standards; and
            (2) submit to the Congress and make available on the public 
        website of the Environmental Protection Agency a report that 
        includes--

                paragraph (1); and
                    (B) a schedule and plan to restore or replace all 
                monitors included in the list under subparagraph (A) to 
                full operation not later than 16 months of the date of 
                enactment of this Act, except that the schedule and 
                plan shall not apply to monitors--
                            (i) that have been discontinued in 
                        accordance with section 58.14(c) of title 40, 
                        Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on 
                        the date of enactment of this Act); and
                            (ii)(I) for which such discontinuation is 
                        not subject to a judicial challenge; or
                            (II) for which a judicial challenge 
                        described in subclause (I) has been fully 
                        resolved by a settlement or order that 
                        authorizes discontinuation of such monitor.
    (g) Designations.--Not later than 2 years after the date on which 
data is received from a monitor sited pursuant to this section that 
demonstrates that an area that is designated pursuant to section 
107(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(1)) by the 
Administrator as in attainment or unclassifiable for an air pollutant 
is in violation of the applicable national ambient air quality 
standard, the Administrator shall redesignate pursuant to section 
107(d)(3) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)(3)) that area as in 
nonattainment for that pollutant unless the designation is otherwise 
precluded under this Act.

                Administration regarding data from the satellites of 
                the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
                use in calculating design values under any national 
                ambient air quality standards for PM&lt;INF&gt;10&lt;/INF&gt; and 
                PM&lt;INF&gt;2.5&lt;/INF&gt;.
                    (B) Regulations required.--The Administrator of the 
                Environmental Protection Agency may promulgate 
                regulations to specify procedures (including any 
                modeling techniques) for using data described in 
                subparagraph (A) in combination with information from 
                multiple sources, including monitors and modeling, to 
                calculate the expected number of exceedances per year 
                and the design values for PM&lt;INF&gt;10&lt;/INF&gt; and 
                PM&lt;INF&gt;2.5&lt;/INF&gt; for purposes of determining compliance 
                or noncompliance with the national ambient air quality 
                standards for those pollutants.
            (2) National academy of sciences report.--
                    (A) In general.--The Administrator may enter into 
                an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences 
                under which the National Academy of Sciences agrees to 
                submit a report that describes the actions necessary, 
                including new science and satellite assets to enable 
                the contribution of satellite monitoring to the 
                calculation of design values and nonattainment 
                determinations under any national ambient air quality 
                standards for ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and oxides of 
                sulfur established pursuant to section 109 of the Clean 
                Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409).
                    (B) Regulations required.--
                            (i) In general.--Not later than December 
                        31, 2023, the Administrator, in coordination 
                        with the Administrator of the National 
                        Aeronautics and Space Administration and the 
                        Administrator of the National Oceanic and 
                        Atmospheric Administration, shall promulgate 
                        regulations that provide a plan for the use of 
                        satellite monitoring data in calculating design 
                        values for the pollutants described in 
                        subparagraph (A).
                            (ii) Requirement.--Not later than January 
                        1, 2027, the Administrator shall implement the 
                        plan required by clause (i) and provide for use 
                        of satellite data in calculating design values 
                        for the pollutants described in subparagraph 
                        (A).
            (3) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``design value'' means, for each pollutant, the air quality 
        statistic the Administrator defines in part 50 (including 
        appendices) of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, for 
        comparison with the relevant national ambient air quality 
        standard established under section 109 of the Clean Air Act (42 
        U.S.C. 7409), regardless of whether the regulation (including 
        appendices) in part 50 of title 40, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, uses the term ``design value''.
    (i) Monitoring Plans.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
the Administrator may not approve a State monitoring plan under section 
58.10 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (or successor 
regulations) unless--
            (1) the State provided, with respect to the State 
        monitoring plan--
                    (A) public notice;

SEC. 6. SENSOR MONITORING.

    (a) Deployment of Air Quality Sensors.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Administrator--
                    (A) shall deploy, in accordance with the 
                prioritization criteria described in section 5(d)(2), 
                not fewer than 1,000 air quality sensors, each of which 
                shall cost not more than $5,000;
                    (B) shall deploy such air quality sensors in 
                clusters of not fewer than five in each of the census 
                tracts or counties selected;
                    (C) before determining and approving sites for such 
                air quality sensors, shall invite, through public 
                notice and other means designed to reach communities 
                disproportionately impacted by air pollution, proposals 
                from or on each behalf of residents of any community 
                for the sites; and
                    (D) may contract with State and local air pollution 
                control agencies to conduct sensor monitoring and 
                report the results.
            (2) Requirement.--In carrying out paragraph (1), the 
        Administrator shall select sensors for deployment that--
                    (A) are available on the market at the time of 
                purchase;
                    (B) the Administrator determines will provide data 
                of sufficient accuracy to provide a reasonable basis 
                for determining whether the location in which the 
                sensor is sited is or may be at risk of exceeding the 
                applicable national ambient air quality standard 
                established pursuant to section 109 of the Clean Air 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 7409); and
                    (C) are the lowest cost available that meet the 
                criteria of subparagraph (B).
            (3) Exception to cost limitation.--Notwithstanding 
        paragraph (1), if the Administrator determines in writing that 
        a sensor model to measure a particular pollutant is not 
        available on the market at a price at or below $5,000 each, the 
        Administrator may spend an amount above $5,000 to acquire such 
        sensor model so long as the Administrator complies with 
        subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (2).
    (b) Pollutants.--
            (1) In general.--Each air quality sensor deployed pursuant 
        to subsection (a) shall measure ozone, PM&lt;INF&gt;2.5&lt;/INF&gt;, oxides 
        of nitrogen, or sulfur dioxide.
            (2) Determination.--The Administrator shall determine which 
        pollutant or air pollutants an air quality sensor deployed 
        pursuant to subsection (a) shall monitor based on the pollution 
        sources affecting the area in which the sensor is to be 
        deployed.
    (c) Determination and Installation.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date on 
        which an air quality sensor deployed pursuant to subsection (a) 
        has been monitoring air quality data for 1 year, the 
        Administrator shall determine whether data from the air quality 
        sensors deployed in the applicable census tract or county shows 
        air pollution levels over the 1-year period ending on the date 
        of the determination that reached 98 percent of the level of 
        the national ambient air quality standard under section 109 of 
        the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409) for any air pollutant.
            (2) Requirement.--If the Administrator makes a 
        determination under paragraph (1) that an air pollutant 
        described in subsection (b)(1) met the threshold described in 
        that paragraph, the Administrator shall, not later 180 days 
        after the date of the determination, ensure that Federal 
        reference method monitors or Federal equivalent method monitors 
        are installed and in operation within that census tract or 
        county for each pollutant that met the threshold.
            (3) Exceptions.--The Administrator shall waive the 
        requirement of paragraph (2) if the Administrator finds, within 
        the 180-day period described in such paragraph, and after 
        providing notice and an opportunity for public comment, that 
        based on clear and convincing evidence--
                    (A) the measurements from the sensor or sensors 
                supporting the determination described in paragraph (2) 
                were so inaccurate as to provide no reasonable basis 
                for finding that levels of the relevant pollutant 
                reached 98 percent of the level of the national ambient 
                air quality standard under section 109 of the Clean Air 
                Act (42 U.S.C. 7409) for the relevant pollutant; or
                    (B) complementary data such as information on the 
                ambient matric, meteorology, measurements from other 
                nearby sensors or ambient monitors, modeling, satellite 
                data, or other relevant and reliable information 
                demonstrate that levels of the relevant pollutant could 
                not have plausibly reached 98 percent of the level of 
                such standard.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of

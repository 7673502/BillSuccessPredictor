SEC. 2. INSPECTOR GENERAL OVERSIGHT.

    Section 3201 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (15 U.S.C. 
9058c) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i) Inspector General Oversight; Recoupment.--
            ``(1) Oversight authority.--The Inspector General of the 
        Department of the Treasury shall conduct monitoring and 
        oversight of the receipt, disbursement, and use of funds made 
        available under this section.
            ``(2) Recoupment.--If the Inspector General of the 
        Department of the Treasury determines that an eligible grantee 
        has failed to comply with subsection (d), the amount equal to 
        the amount of funds used in violation of such subsection shall 
        be booked as a debt of such entity owed to the Federal 
        Government. Amounts recovered under this subsection shall be 
        deposited into the general fund of the Treasury.
            ``(3) Appropriation.--Out of any money in the Treasury of 
        the United States not otherwise appropriated, there are 
        appropriated to the Office of the Inspector General of the 
        Department of the Treasury, $6,500,000 to carry out oversight 
        and recoupment activities under this subsection. Amounts 
        appropriated under the preceding sentence shall remain 
        available until expended.
            ``(4) Authority of inspector general.--Nothing in this 
        subsection shall be construed to diminish the authority of any 
        Inspector General, including such authority as provided in the 
        Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App.).''.

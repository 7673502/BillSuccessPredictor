                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to allow certain participants 
 in the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and 
 children to elect to be issued a variety of types of milk, including 
                  whole milk, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Giving Increased Variety to Ensure 
Milk Into the Lives of Kids Act'' or the ``GIVE MILK Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Most Americans, including most children and 
        adolescents, consume on average only about half of the 
        recommended amounts of dairy foods daily.
            (2) Milk is a source of many nutrients essential to health, 
        and is the leading source of and is a source of twelve 
        essential nutrients (calcium, phosphorus, vitamin A, vitamin D 
        (in fortified products), riboflavin, vitamin B12, protein, 
        potassium, zinc, choline, magnesium, and selenium) in the diets 
        of children and adolescents, including three nutrients of 
        public health concern: vitamin D, calcium, and potassium.
            (3) Dairy foods are associated with improved bone health, a 
        lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a beneficial or neutral effect 
        on blood pressure, and may help reduce the risk of 
        cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, and stroke.
            (4) In a September 2019 report on beverage recommendations 
        for early childhood, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 
        American Academy of Pediatric Dentists, American Academy of 
        Pediatrics, and the American Heart Association found that--
                    (A) medical professionals are in agreement that 
                whole milk is good for childhood development between 
                ages one and two;
                    (B) skim and low-fat milk are recommended for young 
                children;
                    (C) plant-based, non-dairy milks are not 
                recommended for young children; and
                    (D) an expert panel under the study recognized that 
                there has been recent research and discussion regarding 
                the role of dairy fat in healthy dietary patterns but 
                in the absence of clear evidence justifying a departure 
                from current recommendations, such expert panel chose 
                to remain consistent with current guidance recommending 
                whole milk for most children ages 12 to 24 months and 
                fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1 percent) milk for 
                children ages 2 years and older.
            (5) The 2020 through 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans 
        recommendation of the number of dairy servings for young 
        children is--
                    (A) 1.5 to 2 servings for 12 to 23 months; and
                    (B) 2 servings for 24 months.

SEC. 3. WIC ELECTION FOR TYPE OF MILK.

    (a) Election for Type of Milk.--Section 17(f) of the Child 
Nutrition Act of 1966 (7 U.S.C. 1431(f)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following:
            ``(27) Election for type of milk.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other 
                provision of law, in the case of an individual 
                participating in the program authorized by this section 
                who is issued milk by the Secretary, such individual 
                (or the parent or guardian of such individual) may 
                elect to be issued nonfat milk, low-fat milk, reduced 
                fat milk, or whole milk.
                    ``(B) Election.--The Secretary shall issue the type 
                of milk elected by an individual under subparagraph (A) 
                to such individual.''.
    (b) Revision of Regulations.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall 
revise regulations in accordance with the amendments made by this 
section, including revision of section 246.10 of title 7, Code of 
Federal Regulations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

 To require an Inspector General report on domestic violent extremism 
                       against pregnancy centers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Pregnancy Care Centers Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Pregnancy centers are community-based, non-profit 
        organizations that provide compassionate support and resources 
        to women and couples facing unexpected pregnancy and offer 
        life-affirming alternatives to abortion.
            (2) In 2019 alone, 2,700 pregnancy centers across the 
        United States provided almost 2,000,000 people free services 
        and material items that were estimated to be worth 
        approximately $270,000,000.
            (3) The services, which are generally provided at no cost 
        to the patient, included almost 732,000 pregnancy tests, more 
        than 486,000 free ultrasounds, 160,200 STI/STD tests, offering 
        more than 291,000 clients parenting and prenatal education 
        programs, offering more than 21,000 clients after-abortion 
        support, offering more than 881,000 students sexual risk 
        avoidance education presentations, providing nearly 1.3 million 
        packs of diapers, providing more than two million baby outfits, 
        providing over 30,000 new car seats, and providing over 19,000 
        strollers.
            (4) In 2019 alone, pregnancy centers were served by 68,832 
        workers and 80 percent of these workers (53,855) were 
        volunteers. The pregnancy centers employed nearly 3,800 
        licensed medical staff, and over 6,400 licensed medical 
        professionals volunteered their time and skills. In total, 
        10,215 licensed medical staff provided care through pregnancy 
        centers across the Nation.
            (5) From 2016 to 2020, an estimated 828,131 unborn babies' 
        lives have been saved through the work of pregnancy care 
        centers.
            (6) Section 248 of title 18, United States Code, 
        established penalties (including prison sentences) for anyone 
        who intentionally damages or destroys the property of a 
        pregnancy center or ``by force or threat of force or by 
        physical obstruction, intentionally injures, intimidates or 
        interferes with or attempts to injure'' any person because he 
        or she is obtaining services from or providing services at a 
        pregnancy center.
            (7) In June 2022, the Department of Homeland Security 
        issued a Summary of Terrorism Threat to the United States 
        highlighting the danger posed by domestic violent extremists, 
        but this term is not defined in statute and a common definition 
        does not exist within Federal agencies.
            (8) On Friday, June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court of the 
        United States issued the landmark Dobbs v. Jackson Women's 
        Health Organization decision holding, ``The Constitution does 
        not confer a right to abortion; Roe and Casey are overruled; 
        and the authority to regulate abortion is returned to the 
        people and their elected representatives''.
            (9) Seven weeks earlier, on Monday, May 2, 2022, a leaked 
        draft opinion was published, constituting an unprecedented 
        attack on the judicial branch.
            (10) Following the Dobbs leak, the United States saw a rise 
        of domestic violent extremism against pro-life centers and 
        organizations, pregnancy care centers, and religious 
        institutions. These terror attacks included arson, fire 
        bombings, vandalism, and other property damage.
            (11) Pregnancy centers alone reported more than 60 attacks 
        between May 3, 2022, and August 21, 2022.
            (12) On May 3, 2022, Trotter House in Austin, Texas, was

        only a warning . . . Wisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we 
        are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings.''.
            (18) The Communique further stated, ``We demand the 
        disbanding of all anti-choice establishments, fake clinics, and 
        violent anti-choice groups within the next thirty days . . .'' 
        and ``we will not stop, we will not back down''.

            (64) The director testified, ``Our Sacramento center has 
        been forced to hire 24-hour on-site security. We've had to 
        reinforce doors and bulletproof walls and windows. We've 
        removed rocks from our landscaping to inhibit vandalism. We've 
        painted the building with graffiti-proof coating. We've added 
        cameras, armed our staff with pepper spray, and stopped running 
        our mobile clinic because of threats of violence. My staff and 
        I live on constant alert. We have been forced to expend 
        valuable resources on these crucial safety measures, so we can 
        continue to provide the women of our community with free 
        medical care and services in the safest possible 
        environment.''.
            (65) The director further testified, ``What we do is worth 
        the risk. There is a place for clinics like ours in every 
        community--a place for women facing unplanned pregnancies who 
        are seeking dependable medical resources in a safe, caring 
        environment during one of the most difficult times of their

            (73) The Biden Administration has failed to identify the 
        threats, violence, and calls to violence against pregnancy 
        centers as the work of domestic violent extremists.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) terror attacks against pregnancy centers, including 
        arson, fire bombings, vandalism, and other property damage, 
        violate section 248 of title 18, United States Code, and are 
        punishable by fines and imprisonment; and
            (2) the Department of Justice, which is responsible for 
        investigating potential violations of section 248 of title 18, 
        United States Code, and prosecuting the individuals 
        threatening, vandalizing, and damaging pregnancy centers, has 
        abdicated its duty and failed to provide justice for victims of 
        violence.

SEC. 4. REPORT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of 
Justice and the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland 
Security shall submit a report to the committees described in 
subsection (b) on the following:
            (1) A list of each definition of the term ``domestic 
        violent extremism'' that each Inspector General, respectively, 
        finds to be used by the agency or any subagency and a list of 
        nongovernmental organizations that were consulted in the 
        creation of such definition.
            (2) A list of any terms similar to ``domestic violent 
        extremism'' and a definition for each such term that each 
        Inspector General, respectively, finds to be used by the agency 
        or any subagency and a list of nongovernmental organizations 
        that were consulted in the creation of such definition.

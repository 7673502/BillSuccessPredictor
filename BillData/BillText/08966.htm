        higher than the maximum hourly emission rate of such air 
        pollutant that was achievable by such source during any hour in 
        the 10-year period immediately preceding the change''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the term 
        `modification' does not include a change at a stationary source 
        that is designed--
                    ``(i) to reduce the amount of any air pollutant 
                emitted by the source per unit of production; or
                    ``(ii) to restore, maintain, or improve the 
                reliability of operations at, or the safety of, the 
                source,
        except, with respect to either clause (i) or (ii), when the 
        change would be a modification as defined in subparagraph (A) 
        and the Administrator determines that the increase in the 
        maximum achievable hourly emission rate of a pollutant from 
        such change would cause an adverse effect on human health or 
        the environment.''.
    (b) Clarification of Definition of Construction for Prevention of 
Significant Deterioration.--Subparagraph (C) of section 169(2) of the 
Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7479(2)) is amended to read as follows:
                    ``(C) The term `construction', when used in 
                connection with a major emitting facility, includes a 
                modification (as defined in section 111(a)) at such 
                facility, except that for purposes of this subparagraph 
                a modification does not include a change at a major 
                emitting facility that does not result in a significant 
                emissions increase, or a significant net emissions 
                increase, in annual actual emissions at such 
                facility.''.
    (c) Clarification of Definition of Modifications and Modified for 
Nonattainment Areas.--Paragraph (4) of section 171 of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7501) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(4) The terms `modifications' and `modified' mean a 
        modification as defined in section 111(a)(4), except that such 
        terms do not include a change at a major emitting facility that 
        does not result in a significant emissions increase, or a 
        significant net emissions increase, in annual actual emissions 
        at such facility.''.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section or the 
amendments made by this section shall be construed to treat any change 
as a modification for purposes of any provision of the Clean Air Act 
(42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) if such change would not have been so treated 
as of the day before the date of enactment of this Act.

SEC. 10. PROHIBITION ON RETROACTIVE PERMIT VETOES.

    Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 
1344) is amended by striking subsection (c) and inserting the 
following:
    ``(c) Authority of EPA Administrator.--
            ``(1) Possible prohibition of specification.--Until such 
        time as the Secretary has issued a permit under this section, 
        the Administrator may prohibit the specification (including the 
        withdrawal of specification) of any defined area as a disposal 
        site, and the Administrator may deny or restrict the use of any 
        defined area for specification (including the withdrawal of 
        specification) as a disposal site, whenever the Administrator 
        determines, after notice and opportunity for public hearings, 
        that the discharge of such materials into such area will have 
        an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, 
        shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and 
        breeding areas), wildlife, or recreational areas.
            ``(2) Consultation required.--Before making a determination 
        under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consult with the 
        Secretary.
            ``(3) Written findings required.--The Administrator shall 
        set forth in writing and make public the findings and reasons 
        of the Administrator for making any determination under this 
        subsection.''.

    Section 309 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7609) is amended to 
read as follows:

``SEC. 309. POLICY REVIEW.

    ``(a) Environmental Impact of Proposed Legislation.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Administrator shall review, and 
        comment in writing, on the environmental impact of any matter 
        relating to the duties and responsibilities granted to the 
        authority of the Administrator pursuant to this Act or any 
        other law contained in any legislation proposed by a Federal 
        department.
            ``(2) Publish.--A written comment referred to in paragraph 
        (1) shall be made public at the conclusion of any review 
        conducted under that paragraph.
    ``(b) Unsatisfactory Legislation.--In the event the Administrator 
determines that any legislation reviewed under subsection (a)(1) is 
unsatisfactory from the standpoint of public health, welfare, or 
environmental quality, the Administrator shall publish the 
determination of the Administrator and the matter shall be referred to 
the Council on Environmental Quality.''.

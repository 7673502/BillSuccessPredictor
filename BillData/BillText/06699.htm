        reduction agreement (as described in section 403(b) of such 
        Code) shall not require, as a condition of participation in the 
        arrangement or agreement, that an employee complete a period of 
        service with the employer (or employers) maintaining the plan 
        extending beyond the close of the earlier of--
                    ``(A) the period permitted under subsection (a)(1) 
                (determined without regard to subparagraph (B)(i) 
                thereof) and section 410(a)(1) of such Code (determined

        employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by an 
        agreement which the Secretary finds to be a collective 
        bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one 
        or more employers, if there is evidence that retirement 
        benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such 
        employee representatives and such employer or employers.
            ``(3) Coordination with other rules.--In the case of

employee who is eligible to participate in a qualified cash or deferred 
arrangement or a salary reduction agreement under a plan solely by 
reason of section 202(c)(1)(B) has a nonforfeitable right to employer 
contributions--
            ``(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), each 12-month 
        period for which the employee has at least 500 hours of service 
        shall be treated as a year of service; and
            ``(B) 12-month periods occurring before the 24-month period 
        described in section 202(c)(1)(B) shall not be treated as years 
        of service.
For purposes of this paragraph, 12-month periods shall be determined in 
the same manner as under the last sentence of section 202(a)(3)(A), 
except that 12-month periods beginning before January 1, 2022, shall 
not be taken into account.''.
    (c) Penalty.--Section 502 of the Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1132) is amended by adding at the end 
the following new subsection:
    ``(n) Requirements Relating to Part-Time Employees.--In the case of 
a plan that fails to permit participation as required by section 
202(c), the Secretary may assess a civil penalty against the plan 
sponsor in an amount equal to $10,000 per year per employee to whom 
such failure relates. The Secretary may, in the Secretary's sole 
discretion, waive or reduce the penalty under this subsection if the 
Secretary determines that the plan sponsor acted reasonably and in good 
faith.''.

                desired number of weekly work hours and the days and 
                times the employee is available to work;
                    (B) notify the employee that this written statement 
                may be modified in writing at any time during 
                employment; and

        employer shall schedule an employee of the employer to work the 
        number of weekly hours identified by the employee as desired 
        weekly hours in a written statement under subsection (a) prior 
        to hiring any new employee from an external applicant pool, 
        including hiring through the use of a temporary services or 
        staffing agency, or contracting with a contractor or 
        subcontractor, to work such hours.
            (2) Exceptions.--An employer may hire an individual as a 
        new employee, or engage a contractor or subcontractor, to 
        perform work for the employer if--

                employees of the employer who have provided written 
                statements under subsection (a) are available based on 
                such written statements;
                    (B) all employees of the employer who have provided 
                written statements under subsection (a) lack, and 
                cannot obtain with reasonable training, the 
                qualifications necessary to perform the work; or
                    (C) scheduling any such employee to perform the 
                work would require providing such employee overtime 
                compensation at a rate not less than one and one half 
                times the regular rate at which the employee is 
                employed, in accordance with section 7 of the Fair 
                Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207) or any 
                State law.

            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), an 
        employee (referred to in this subsection as an ``existing 
        employee'') who is not scheduled for the desired number of 
        total weekly work hours identified by the employee in a written 
        statement under subsection (a) shall be compensated for each 
        hour worked by a newly hired employee, contractor, or 
        subcontractor hired after the existing employee so identified 
        such number of hours, during an hour that such existing 
        employee identified in a written statement under such 
        subsection as an hour for which the employee is available to 
        work.
            (2) Exception.--An employer shall not be required to

                reasonable training, the qualifications necessary to 
                perform the work;
                    (B) scheduling such employee to perform the work 
                would require providing the employee overtime 
                compensation as described in subsection (b)(2)(C);
                    (C) the employer made a reasonable attempt to

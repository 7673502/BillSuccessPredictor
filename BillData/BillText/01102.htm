of the enactment of this section, the Postal Service may not change 
such mode of delivery to centralized delivery.
    ``(c) Approval Required.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Postal Service may not require 
        centralized delivery with respect to any housing development 
        constructed after the date of the enactment of this section 
        without prior approval from the local legislative body, or, in 
        the absence of a local legislative body, the legislature of the 
        State with jurisdiction over the affected property.
            ``(2) Notice and comment.--If approval for centralized

negative affect on rural, lower income, elderly, disabled, or 
predominately minority communities.

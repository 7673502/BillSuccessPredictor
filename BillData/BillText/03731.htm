                                 A BILL


 
To assist communities affected by stranded nuclear waste, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Sensible, Timely Relief for 
America's Nuclear Districts' Economic Development Act of 2021'' or the 
``STRANDED Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) communities throughout the United States, including 
        communities in the States of California, Connecticut, Florida, 
        Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New 
        York, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, and Wisconsin, are tasked with 
        dealing with stranded nuclear waste;
            (2) communities affected by stranded nuclear waste are de 
        facto interim nuclear waste storage sites;
            (3) the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 U.S.C. 10101 
        et seq.)--
                    (A) directed the Secretary of Energy to make annual 
                impact assistance payments to States or appropriate 
                units of local government to mitigate the social and 
                economic impacts of the establishment and operation of 
                interim nuclear waste storage capacity within the 
                jurisdictional boundaries of an affected community; and
                    (B) established the rate for impact assistance 
                payments at $15 per kilogram of spent nuclear fuel;
            (4) decommissioning a commercial nuclear power plant is 
        often catastrophic for the host community because nuclear power 
        plants are major employers and the primary source of local tax 
        revenue;
            (5) stranded nuclear waste is a profound obstacle to future 
        economic growth, deterring potential employers and residents 
        from considering the host community;
            (6) stranded nuclear waste prevents economic development in 
        communities in which the stranded nuclear waste is located;
            (7) stranded nuclear waste prevents communities from 
        redeveloping sites where nuclear power plants previously 
        operated which further inhibits tax revenues; and
            (8) it is critical to provide resources to communities 
        that--
                    (A) are challenged by stranded nuclear waste; or
                    (B) will be challenged by stranded nuclear waste 
                during the 10-year period beginning on the date of 
                enactment of this Act.

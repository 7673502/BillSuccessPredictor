                                 A BILL


 
  To provide for the settlement of claims relating to the Shab-eh-nay 
         Band Reservation in Illinois, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation Shab-
eh-nay Band Reservation Settlement Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) pursuant to the Treaty of July 29, 1829, made and 
        concluded at Prairie du Chien (7 Stat. 320) (commonly known as 
        the ``Second Treaty of Prairie du Chien''), the Potawatomi and 
        other affected Indian Tribes ceded certain land in northern 
        Illinois, except for 2 parcels totaling 1,280 acres for 
        Potawatomi Chief Shab-eh-nay and his Band at their village near 
        Paw Paw Grove, Illinois;
            (2)(A) pursuant to the Treaty of September 26, 1833, made 
        at Chicago (7 Stat. 431) (commonly known as the ``Treaty of 
        Chicago''), the Potawatomi and other Indians ceded 
        approximately 5,000,000 acres of land, including the Shab-eh-
        nay Band Reservation; but
            (B) the Senate rejected the provision that ceded that 
        reservation, with the effect of affirming the Indian-held title 
        and boundaries of the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
            (3)(A) in 1849, while Chief Shab-eh-nay was visiting his 
        relatives in Kansas, the Commissioner of the General Land 
        Office of the United States sold the Shab-eh-nay Band 
        Reservation at public auction to non-Indians who erroneously 
        believed that they had acquired good title to the land on which 
        the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation is located; and
            (B) the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation is illegally occupied 
        as of the date of enactment of this Act;
            (4) the Associate Solicitor of the Department of the 
        Interior issued an opinion on July 24, 2000, that concluded 
        that--
                    (A) ``the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation continues to 
                exist'';
                    (B) there is no evidence that Chief Shab-eh-nay 
                abandoned the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation; and
                    (C) ``even if it were true that Shab-eh-nay's Band 
                had abandoned the land, the Band's treaty recognized 
                title to that land could not be extinguished without 
                Congressional action'';
            (5) the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior issued 
        an opinion on January 18, 2001, that--
                    (A) confirmed the findings of the Associate 
                Solicitor of the Department of the Interior under 
                paragraph (4); and
                    (B) stated that--
                            (i) the Shab-eh-nay Band held recognized 
                        title to the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
                            (ii) Congress never authorized the 
                        conveyance of the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
                            (iii) the Tribe is the lawful successor in 
                        interest to Chief Shab-eh-nay and his Band; and
                            (iv) the Department of the Interior 
                        believes that the United States continues to 
                        bear a trust responsibility to the Tribe for 
                        the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
            (6) Congress has never acted by treaty or statute to 
        extinguish the recognized Indian title to the Shab-eh-nay Band 
        Reservation;
            (7) the Tribe is the successor in interest to Chief Shab-
        eh-nay and his Band and the rightful owner and occupant of the 
        Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
            (8) the Federal Government, through the actions of the 
        General Land Office, has deprived the Tribe of the right of 
        exclusive use and occupancy of the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation 
        without legal authorization or just compensation;
            (9) certain non-Indian individuals, entities, and local 
        governments occupying land within the boundaries of the Shab-
        eh-nay Band Reservation as of the date of enactment of this 
        Act, including the State and the County--
                    (A) acquired ownership interests to the land in 
                good faith; and
                    (B) should be able to possess clear title to the 
                land; and
            (10) the United States has a moral and legal 
        responsibility--
                    (A) to help secure a fair and equitable settlement 
                of past inequities to the Tribe; and
                    (B) to ensure protection of the ownership interests 
                of non-Indian occupants of the Shab-eh-nay Band 
                Reservation.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to acknowledge the unlawful sale by the Federal 
        Government of the valuable right held by the Tribe to the 
        exclusive use and occupancy of the Shab-eh-nay Band 
        Reservation;
            (2) to reaffirm Federal recognition of the ownership by the 
        Tribe of, and jurisdiction over, land that the Tribe owns 
        within the Shab-eh-nay Band Reservation;
            (3) to promote the economic self-sufficiency of the Tribe 
        and the members of the Tribe;
            (4) to extinguish the Indian title to, and confirm the 
        ownership by the State, the County, and certain individuals and 
        entities of, certain land within the boundaries of the Shab-eh-
        nay Band Reservation;
            (5) to provide stability and security to the State and 
        residents of the State, the local governments and the areas 
        over which the local governments exercise jurisdiction, and 
        businesses regarding the ownership and use by the Tribe of the 
        Reaffirmed Reservation;
            (6) to extinguish potential claims by the Tribe against the 
        United States, the State, the local governments, and private 
        individuals and entities that could be a direct consequence of 
        not reaching a settlement with the Tribe;
            (7) to require the Secretary to preserve and protect, but 
        not manage, the Reaffirmed Reservation in furtherance of trust 
        responsibility of the Federal Government; and
            (8) to authorize the Secretary--
                    (A) to execute the waiver and release of claims and 
                compensate the Tribe; and
                    (B) to take any other action necessary to carry out 
                this Act.

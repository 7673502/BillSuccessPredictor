                location of the polling place not later than 7 days 
                before the date of the election or the first day of an 
                early voting period (whichever occurs first); or
                    ``(B) if the State makes such an assignment fewer 
                than 7 days before the date of the election and the 
                individual appears on the date of the election at the 
                polling place to which the individual was previously 
                assigned, the State shall make every reasonable effort 
                to enable the individual to vote on the date of the 
                election.
            ``(2) Methods of notification.--The State shall notify an

        telephone, and (if available) text message and electronic mail.
            ``(3) Placement of signs at closed polling places.--If a 
        location which served as a polling place in an election for 
        Federal office does not serve as a polling place in the next

        the State shall ensure that signs are posted at such location 
        on the date of the election and during any early voting period 
        for the election containing the following information:
                    ``(A) A statement that the location is not serving 
                as a polling place in the election.

                number and website, for the appropriate State or local 
                election official through which an individual may find 
                the polling place to which the individual is assigned 
                for the election.

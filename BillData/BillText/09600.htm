                    (A) the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to 
                those Federal lands under the jurisdiction of the 
                Secretary of the Interior; and
                    (B) the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to

            (6) Roads.--Roads are defined as roads available only to 
        street legal vehicles.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Sierra Nevada ecosystem is a diverse mountain range 
        that is geologically, ecologically, hydrologically, 
        recreationally and historically significant to the American 
        people.
            (2) The Range of Light National Monument sits between two 
        National Parks, Yosemite and Kings Canyon, in the center of 
        longest interconnected wilderness in the contiguous United 
        States and its establishment will create an interconnected 
        wildlife corridor to facilitate the migration and survival of 
        native species and provide habitat for rare, threatened, and 
        endangered species.
            (3) The Sierra Nevada ecosystem contains one of the most 
        diverse coniferous forests in the world. Ponderosa pine, 
        incense-cedar, white-fir, douglas-fir, sugar pine and scattered 
        groves of giant sequoia intermix and coexist. These trees fight 
        climate change, store carbon, and support a vast array of 
        California's wildlife.
            (4) The Sierra Nevada ecosystem and watershed is vital to 
        the people of California. The rivers, springs, alpine lakes and 
        groundwater within the watershed contribute to the Kings, the 
        Merced, and the San Joaquin Rivers, which support wildlife, 
        enhance recreation, and provide drinking water for millions of 
        Californians.
            (5) The interactions between the climate, topography and 
        biota in the Sierra Nevada have created some of the most 
        productive soils for conifers in the world, which has improved 
        vegetation, erosion, wildlife distribution, and water quality 
        throughout the range. These soils harbor the microorganisms and 
        nutrients that provide the basis for the forest's health and 
        support hundreds of plant species, many of which are endemic to 
        the region and are found nowhere else on earth.
            (6) The Range of Light ecosystems, forests, and watersheds 
        provide a wild and rugged landscape enjoyed by hikers, 
        bicyclists, birders, picnickers, sight seers, fishermen, 
        campers, rock climbers, boaters, equestrians, and other 
        recreationists.
            (7) Sierra Nevada tribes have been stewards of the land for 
        more than 10,000 years. Native Americans of the Sierra Nevada 
        have hunted, fished, gathered, and made their homes throughout 
        the region. Many sites along rivers and elsewhere in the 
        national monument are part of tribal history and are considered 
        sacred. Preserving these sites is vital to maintaining tribal 
        identity, as well as enabling the continuation and renewal of 
        annual cultural traditions and ecological land management 
        practices.

SEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RANGE OF LIGHT NATIONAL MONUMENT, 
              CALIFORNIA.

    (a) Establishment and Boundaries.--Subject to valid existing 
rights, there is established the Range of Light National Monument as a 
unit of the National Park System in the State of California, which 
consists of approximately 1,427,750 acres of Federal land and interests 
in Federal land in California, as generally depicted in the map 
entitled ``Range of Light National Monument Map'' and dated November 
2022. The Range of Light National Monument is composed of the Sierra 
National Forest in its entirety and the San Joaquin Gorge managed by 
the Bureau of Land Management.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of the national monument are--
            (1) to preserve, protect, and restore nationally 
        significant biological, ecological, cultural, historical, 
        recreational, geological, hydrological, scenic, and scientific 
        resources in the Sierra Nevada's ecosystems, forests, and 
        soils;
            (2) to preserve, protect, and restore watersheds, including 
        meadows, above ground tributaries, springs and groundwater, and 
        surface waters that contribute to the San Joaquin, Kings, and 
        Merced Rivers;
            (3) to provide wildlife connectivity and a migratory area 
        for native species and to provide habitat for rare, threatened, 
        and endangered species through protection and restoration;
            (4) to secure now and for future generations the 
        opportunity to experience and enjoy a diverse and natural 
        forest landscape, wildlife, free-flowing water, an unfettered 
        rugged environment, and recreation on public land;
            (5) to provide environmentally responsible, well-managed 
        recreational opportunities and spaces for people to connect 
        with nature within the national monument;
            (6) to provide educational, recreational, visitor, and 
        interpretive services that will increase public understanding 
        of and appreciation for the natural and cultural resources of 
        the Sierra Nevada and the national monument area; and
            (7) to protect Native American sacred cultural sites and 
        traditional practices and to involve Native Americans in the 
        planning and the care of native plants and cultural sites in 
        the monument area.
    (c) Transfer and Administration of Lands.--Upon enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall transfer the Federal lands and

the national monument, Congress declares its intention to retain 
selected dirt roads. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
Federal lands may be used for the construction of any new road or to 
pave any existing dirt road or to pave any partially paved dirt road in 
the national monument. Roads that are deemed destructive to the natural 
landscape or harm wildlife and the values of the national monument 
shall be closed at the discretion of the park service.
    (l) Private Property Access.--In instances where roads have been 
closed to the public and those roads lead to private property, the 
private property owners shall retain the right to access their lands 
via the closed road.
    (m) Native American Cultural and Religious Uses.--Nothing in this 
Act diminishes--
            (1) the rights of any Indian tribe; or
            (2) any tribal rights regarding access to Federal land for 
        tribal activities, including spiritual, cultural, and 
        traditional food-gathering activities.

                                 A BILL


 
To require the Student Loan Ombudsman of the Department of Education to 
     provide student loan data to the Bureau of Consumer Financial 
                  Protection, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``CFPB Student Loan Integrity and 
Transparency Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The total amount of outstanding student loans just 
        surpassed $1,500,000,000,000.
            (2) Student loans are the biggest category of consumer 
        borrowing after mortgages.
            (3) Since the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (12 
        U.S.C. 5481 et seq.) established the Consumer Financial 
        Protection Bureau, the Bureau has fought to ensure families 
        receive a fair shake as they strive for the American Dream.
            (4) The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 created a 
        Student Loan Ombudsman at the Consumer Financial Protection 
        Bureau. In 2011, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 
        established an Office for Students and Young Consumers, led by 
        the Student Loan Ombudsman, to assist students who are 
        mistreated or misled by predatory lenders.
            (5) Since its creation, the Office of Students and Young 
        Consumers, led by the Student Loan Ombudsman, has defended 
        military families in the United States from predatory lenders 
        and for-profit colleges, and other unscrupulous businesses.
            (6) The Office of Students and Young Consumers helped tens 
        of thousands of active-duty military service members who were 
        being overcharged for student loans, and coordinating with the 
        United States Justice Department, succeeded in returning 
        $60,000,000 to the service members, and required the industry 
        to improve its practices.
            (7) The Office of Students and Young Consumers has 
        collected and analyzed hundreds of thousands of student 
        complaints.
            (8) The Office of Students and Young Consumers has 
        recovered more than $750,000,000 on behalf of defrauded 
        students.
            (9) The Office of Students and Young Consumers has been 
        instrumental in the shutdown of for-profit universities and 
        colleges that had been accused of predatory practices.
            (10) The Office of Students and Young Consumers collected 
        data and authored a report that showed large banks overcharged 
        college students fees that were higher than many of their 
        competitors. The report remained unpublished by the 
        Administration until a recent FOIA request opened it to the 
        public.
            (11) The Department of Education Office of Inspector 
        General released a concerning report on February 12, 2019, that 
        highlighted the alarming frequency at which student loan 
        contractors and vendors engaged in noncompliance with Federal 
        requirements for servicing student loans.

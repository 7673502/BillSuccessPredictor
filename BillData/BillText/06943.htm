                    One Hundred Seventeenth Congress

                                 of the

                        United States of America


                          AT THE SECOND SESSION

           Begun and held at the City of Washington on Monday,
          the third day of January, two thousand and twenty-two


                                 An Act


 
   To amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to 
  authorize public safety officer death benefits to officers suffering 
 from post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder, and for 
                             other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Officer Support Act of 
2022''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) Every day, public safety officers, including police 
    officers, firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and others, 
    work to maintain the safety, health, and well-being of the 
    communities they serve.
        (2) This means public safety officers are routinely called to 
    respond to stressful and potentially traumatic situations, often 
    putting their own lives in danger.
        (3) This work not only puts public safety officers at-risk for 
    experiencing harm, serious injury, and cumulative and acute trauma, 
    but also places them at up to 25.6 times higher risk for developing 
    post-traumatic stress disorder when compared to individuals without 
    such experiences.
        (4) Psychological evidence indicates that law enforcement 
    officers experience significant job-related stressors and exposures 
    that may confer increased risk for mental health morbidities (such 
    as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts, ideation, 
    intents, and behaviors) and hastened mortality.
        (5) Public safety officers often do not have the resources or 
    support they need, leaving them at higher risk for long-term mental 
    health consequences.
        (6) Whereas, although the Department of Defense already 
    considers servicemember suicides to be line-of-duty deaths and 
    provides Federal support to eligible surviving families, the 
    Federal Government does not recognize public safety officer 
    suicides as deaths in the line of duty.
        (7) In 2017, the Department of Justice approved 481 claims 
    under the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program under subpart 1 
    of part L of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets 
    Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10281 et seq.), but not one of them for the 
    more than 240 public safety officers who died by suicide that year.
        (8) Public safety officers who have died or are disabled as a 
    result of suicide or post-traumatic stress disorder do not qualify 
    for the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, despite the fact 
    that public safety officers are more likely to die by suicide than 
    from any other line-of-duty cause of death.
SEC. 3. PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER DEATH BENEFITS FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS 
DISORDER, ACUTE STRESS DISORDER, OR TRAUMA AND STRESS RELATED 
DISORDERS.

        while on duty, to a traumatic event, which action was intended 
        to bring about the officer's death and directly and proximately

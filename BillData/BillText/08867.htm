    This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Abortion Facilities from 
Extremists for Patients Act'' or the ``SAFE for Patients Act''.

SEC. 2. CAUSE OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES.

    (a) Cause of Action.--Any person may bring a civil action against 
any person who--
            (1) intentionally damages or destroys the property of a 
        facility that provides reproductive health services, or 
        attempts to do so, because such facility provides reproductive 
        health services;
            (2) by force or threat of force or by physical obstruction 
        intentionally harasses, injures, intimidates, or interferes 
        with a person because that person is providing or obtaining 
        reproductive health services; or
            (3) knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the 
        performance of an action described pursuant to paragraphs (1) 
        or (2).
    (b) Award of Damages.--If a claimant prevails on an action brought 
under subsection (a), the court shall award--
            (1) injunctive relief sufficient to prevent the defendant 
        from further violation of subsection (a) or engaging in acts 
        that aid or abet a violation of subsection (a);
            (2) statutory damages in an amount of not less than $10,000 
        per violation of subsection (a); and
            (3) costs and attorney's fees.
    (c) Not a Defense.--Notwithstanding any other law, the following 
shall not be a defense for a violation of subsection (a):
            (1) Ignorance or mistake of law.
            (2) A defendant's belief that the requirements of this 
        section are unconstitutional or were unconstitutional.
            (3) A defendant's reliance on any court decision that has 
        been overruled on appeal or by a subsequent court, even if that 
        court decision had not been overruled when the defendant 
        engaged in conduct that violates this section.
            (4) A defendant's reliance on any State or Federal court 
        decision that is not binding on the court in which the action 
        has been brought.
            (5) Non-mutual issue preclusion or non-mutual claim 
        preclusion.
    (d) Statute of Limitations.--A person may bring an action under 
this section not later than the four years after the date on which the 
violation of subsection (a) occurred.
    (e) Reproductive Health Services Defined.--In this section, the 
term ``reproductive health services'' shall have the meaning given such 
term in section 248 of title 18, United States Code.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

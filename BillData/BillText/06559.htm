    (a) In General.--Section 487(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 
(20 U.S.C. 1094(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(30)(A) The institution will not provide any manner of 
        preferential treatment in the admission process to applicants 
        on the basis of their relationships to--

        subparagraph (A)(ii) for an award year for an eligible 
        institution described in section 371(a) if such institution

        preferential treatment in the admission process to applicants 
        on the basis of their relationships to alumni of the 
        institution is in the best interest of students who have been 
        historically underrepresented in higher education.''.

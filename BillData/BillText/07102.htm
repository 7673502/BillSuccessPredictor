    To prohibit the export of crude oil and finished motor gasoline 
         produced in the United States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``American Energy for American 
Consumers Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON THE EXPORT OF CRUDE OIL AND FINISHED MOTOR 
              GASOLINE.

    (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
President shall promulgate a rule prohibiting, during the period 
described in subsection (d), the export of crude oil and finished motor 
gasoline (as defined by the Energy Information Administration) produced 
in the United States.
    (b) Exemptions.--In promulgating the rule under subsection (a), the 
President may exempt from the prohibition described in such subsection 
exports of crude oil or finished motor gasoline--
            (1) as the President determines to be consistent with the 
        national interest, taking into account the national interest as 
        related to the need to leave uninterrupted or unimpaired--
                    (A) exchanges in similar quantity for convenience 
                or increased efficiency of transportation with persons 
                or the government of a foreign country;
                    (B) temporary exports for convenience or increased 
                efficiency of transportation across parts of an 
                adjacent foreign country which exports reenter the 
                United States; and
                    (C) the historical trading relations of the United 
                States with Canada and Mexico; or
            (2) as the President determines appropriate for national 
        security purposes, such as to a country that is a party to a 
        mutual defense treaty with the United States.
    (c) Waiver of Notice and Comment.--
            (1) In general.--The provisions of subchapter II of chapter 
        5 of title 5, United States Code, shall apply with respect to 
        the promulgation of any rule pursuant to this section, except 
        that the President may waive the requirement pertaining to the 
        notice of proposed rulemaking or period for comment only if the 
        President finds that compliance with such requirements may 
        seriously impair the ability of the President to impose 
        effective and timely prohibitions on exports.
            (2) Opportunity to comment thereafter.--In the event such 
        notice and comment period are waived with respect to a rule 
        promulgated under this section, the President shall afford 
        interested persons an opportunity to comment on any such rule 
        at the earliest practicable date thereafter.
    (d) Applicability.--The period described in this subsection is the 
period that begins on the effective date of the rule promulgated under 
subsection (a) and ends on the earlier of--
            (1) the date that the President determines the national 
        average price for unleaded gasoline has been, for a period of 
        at least 30 days, at or below the national average price for 
        unleaded gasoline on January 1, 2022; and
            (2) the date that the President determines is the formal 
        end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

                                 A BILL


 
  To improve the infant formula supply chain, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF TARIFFS.

    During the 90-day period beginning on the date of enactment of this 
Act, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, no duty shall be 
imposed with respect to the importation of any infant formula product.

SEC. 2. STUDY ON FEASIBILITY OF INFANT FORMULA DISTRIBUTION CENTERS 
              REMAINING OPEN FOR 24 HOURS A DAY.

    The Comptroller General of the United States shall--
            (1) study the feasibility of food infant formula 
        distribution centers remaining open for 24 hours a day and any 
        corresponding impacts to supply chains, including to determine 
        whether keeping such centers open 24 hours a day would 
        contribute to increasing the flow of goods and products to 
        store shelves and final points of sale; and
            (2) not later 30 days after the date of enactment of this 
        Act, complete such study and submit to the Congress a report on 
        the results of such study.

                                 A BILL


 
    To promote international press freedom, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``International Press Freedom Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Even as the number of journalists killed in war zones 
        has reached a historic low, the number of journalists killed or 
        targeted in countries at peace continues to remain at 
        historically high levels. In 2020, more than \2/3\ of all media 
        fatalities took place in countries at peace.
            (2) Even as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of 
        journalists reporting from the field, Reporters Without Borders 
        (RSF) reported that 50 journalists were killed in 2020. 
        Additionally, as of December 2020, 387 journalists remained 
        imprisoned worldwide, continuing the historically high trend 
        seen in previous years, and 57 journalists were held hostage.
            (3) As the frontier between countries at war and countries 
        at peace continues to disappear, more must be done to protect 
        journalists and activists defending human rights and spreading 
        awareness of abuse and corruption.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a free and vibrant press is the fulcrum of democracy;
            (2) the protection and advancement of the freedom of 
        expression is a foundational value of the United States;
            (3) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the 
        General Assembly of the United Nations adopted in 1948 with the 
        United States voting in favor, defines freedom of expression, 
        which includes a free press, as a fundamental human right;
            (4) the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
        Rights, which the United States ratified in 1992, specifies 
        that everyone shall have the ``freedom to seek, receive and 
        impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of 
        frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form 
        of art, or through any other media of his choice''; and
            (5) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to promote the spread of democratic values and 
        institutions worldwide.

        added by paragraph (1)--
                    (A) is permitted to remain in the United States--

                                 A BILL


 
    To designate the area between the intersections of 16th Street, 
 Northwest and Fuller Street, Northwest and 16th Street, Northwest and 
   Euclid Street, Northwest in Washington, District of Columbia, as 
                         ``Oswaldo Paya Way''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the dictatorship imposed by Fidel Castro in Cuba in 
        1959 started 61 years of an ongoing dictatorship, systemic 
        human rights abuses, and a lack of basic freedom of press, 
        religion, assembly, and association that continue to this day 
        under Communist rule;
            (2) Oswaldo Paya Sardinas was a Cuban prodemocracy activist 
        dedicated to promoting democratic freedoms and human rights in 
        Cuba;
            (3) the Communist Party of Cuba has always viewed that 
        commitment to democracy and freedom as a threat to the 
        existence of the Communist Party of Cuba;
            (4) on July 22, 2012, a violent car crash, widely believed 
        to have been carried out by the Castro regime, took the lives 
        of Oswaldo Paya and Harold Cepero, another prodemocracy 
        activist;
            (5) the regime in Cuba has offered no plausible evidence of 
        the innocence of the Castro regime in the crash, leaving the 
        circumstances of the death of Oswaldo Paya suspicious;
            (6) opposition by Oswaldo Paya to the Communist Party of 
        Cuba began at a young age, when he refused to become a member 
        of the Young Communist League as a primary school student, and 
        continued through high school, when he publicly criticized the 
        invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet Union;
            (7) the Communist Party of Cuba responded to the opposition 
        by Oswaldo Paya to the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Soviet 
        Union by sending Oswaldo Paya to a labor camp for 3 years;
            (8) Oswaldo Paya forewent a chance to escape Cuba in the 
        1980 Mariel boatlift, deciding instead to continue the fight 
        for democracy in Cuba, saying, ``This is what I am supposed to 
        be, this is what I have to do.'';
            (9) Oswaldo Paya repeatedly demonstrated his staunch 
        commitment to peacefully advocating for freedom of speech, 
        religious liberty, and freedom of assembly for his fellow 
        Cubans;
            (10) in recognition of his determination for political 
        reforms through peaceful protests, Oswaldo Paya was awarded the 
        Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European 
        Parliament in 2002 and the W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award 
        from the National Democratic Institute for International 
        Affairs in 2003 and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by 
        former Czech President Vaclav Havel in 2005;
            (11) on April 11, 2018, the Senate unanimously passed S. 
        Res. 224, recognizing the sixth anniversary of the death of 
        Oswaldo Paya Sardinas, commemorating his legacy and commitment 
        to democratic values and principles, and calling for an 
        impartial, third-party investigation into the circumstances 
        surrounding his death; and
            (12) renaming the street in front of the Embassy of Cuba in 
        the District of Columbia after Oswaldo Paya serves as an 
        expression of solidarity between the people of the United 
        States and the people of Cuba, who are engaged in a long, 
        nonviolent struggle for fundamental human rights.

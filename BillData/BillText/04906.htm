                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title 18, United States Code, to include doping fraud as a 
 predicate offense for racketeering and money laundering offenses, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Guarantee Oversight and Litigation 
on Doping Act'' or the ``GOLD Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the punishment of Russia for persistent decades-long 
        state-run doping fraud by the international sport governance 
        structure has been insufficient and Russia's competing status 
        as ``ROC'' at Tokyo 2020 demonstrates to authoritarian states 
        around the world that systematic doping will be tolerated; and
            (2) aggressive enforcement of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping 
        Act of 2019 (21 U.S.C. 2401 et seq.) can create the deterrent 
        required to curb doping fraud as the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
        Act of 1977 (15 U.S.C. 78dd-1 et seq.) curbed foreign bribery 
        and the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of 
        Investigation should prioritize enforcement of the Rodchenkov 
        Anti-Doping Act of 2019 (21 U.S.C. 2401 et seq.).

SEC. 3. PREDICATE OFFENSES.

    Part I of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in section 1956(c)(7)(D)--
                    (A) by striking ``or section 104(a)'' and inserting 
                ``section 104(a)''; and
                    (B) by inserting after ``North Korea)'' the 
                following: ``, or section 3 of the Rodchenkov Anti-
                Doping Act of 2019 (21 U.S.C. 2402) (relating to 
                prohibited activities with respect to major 
                international doping fraud conspiracies)''; and
            (2) in section 1961(1)--
                    (A) by striking ``or (G) any act'' and inserting 
                ``(G) any act''; and
                    (B) by inserting after ``section 2332(b)(g)(5)(B)'' 
                the following: ``, or (H) any act that is indictable 
                under section 3 of the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act of 
                2019 (21 U.S.C. 2402)''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

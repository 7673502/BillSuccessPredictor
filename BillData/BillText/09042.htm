                source of power supply on July 1, 1957: And provided 
                further, That no part of such additional area may be in 
                a State not now served by the Corporation or its 
                distributors or in a municipality receiving electric 
                service from another source on or after July 1, 1957, 
                and no more than five hundred square miles of such

                supplying electric power to any customer within any 
                area in which the Corporation or its distributors had 
                generally established electric service on July 1, 1957, 
                and to which electric service was not being supplied

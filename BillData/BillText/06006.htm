SEC. 5. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Advances in technology have led to the creation of 
        digital assets and blockchain technology that will improve the 
        United States financial system and create a more fair and 
        equitable structure for everyday Americans.
            (2) The reporting requirements under current law require 
        digital asset market participants to adhere to standards that 
        are incompatible with this technology's operation. This will 
        hinder the development of digital assets and its underlying 
        technology in the United States, shifting its development 
        outside the United States.
            (3) The Chinese Government's recent ban of cryptocurrency 
        transactions provides the United States an opening to further 
        enhance its role as the leading nation in the development of 
        innovative blockchain technologies. Providing clear rules for 
        both consumers and developers of digital assets is essential to 
        taking advantage of this opportunity.
            (4) Miners and validators, hardware and software 
        developers, and protocol developers are not actual brokers and 
        do not collect or have reason to collect the information 
        required under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
            (5) It is not in the interest of American taxpayers for 
        Congress to create uncertainty.
            (6) Consistent and accurate reporting on digital asset 
        transactions is necessary. Congress must work to bring legal 
        and regulatory certainty to the digital asset industry. Clear 
        rules of the road fosters technology and innovation.
            (7) Any amendments made by this Act will not impact revenue 
        estimated from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit certain anticompetitive mergers, to amend the Clayton Act 
to permit the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to 
reject proposed acquisitions, to implement procedures for retrospective 
 reviews and breaking up anticompetitive consummated acquisitions, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibiting Anticompetitive Mergers 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Constitution of the United States prohibits 
        political or economic oligarchies, which are incompatible with 
        a republican form of government;
            (2) the antitrust laws, including the Sherman Act (15 
        U.S.C. 1 et seq.), the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 12 et seq.), and 
        the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.), were 
        enacted to prohibit political and economic oligarchies, to 
        protect fair, open, and competitive markets, and to prevent 
        corporations from abusing their power to stifle competition and 
        improperly influence democratic processes;
            (3) Federal courts have misinterpreted the antitrust laws 
        to the detriment of consumers, workers, society, and the United 
        States political economy, including by enhancing the misguided 
        and narrowly defined ``consumer welfare standard,'' as 
        described by the Supreme of the United States in Reiter v. 
        Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330 (1979), and its progeny;
            (4) concentrated economic power creates concentrated 
        political power, allowing giant corporations to invest growing 
        sums of money into influencing government to tilt laws and 
        rules in their favor;
            (5) over the last 4 decades, powerful corporations have 
        unconstitutionally amassed too much influence over the United 
        States economy, stifling competition in United States markets 
        and harming workers, consumers, customer choice, sellers, small 
        and minority-owned businesses (including farms and ranches), 
        local, rural, and low-income communities, communities of color, 
        privacy, quality, entrepreneurship, and innovation;
            (6) in 1975, 109 companies pocketed half of all profits 
        generated by firms in the United States whereas in 2015, the 
        top 30 firms did so;
            (7) startup rates fell by more than half over the last 4 
        decades in industries that saw an increase in concentration;
            (8) dominant corporations, which often underinvest in their 
        operations and infrastructure, expose consumers in the United 
        States to the risks of concentrated and brittle supply chains, 
        such as shortages of essential goods and increased prices;
            (9) market concentration in essential markets, including 
        those for medical equipment, food, and retail, can pose serious 
        national-security risks during crisis events such as the COVID-
        19 pandemic;
            (10) market concentration is associated with lower wages, 
        and evidence shows that in more concentrated markets, giant 
        corporations are less likely to pass on productivity gains to 
        workers in the form of higher wages and more likely to engage 
        in antiworker labor practices, which disproportionately harm 
        female workers and workers of color;
            (11) corporate consolidation has especially harmed rural 
        communities, low-income communities, and communities of color, 
        as demonstrated by the impact of the recent Sprint and T-Mobile 
        merger on low-income customers who purchase prepaid plans;
            (12) Federal agencies other than the Federal Trade 
        Commission and the Department of Justice may have particular 
        expertise with respect to the competitive effects of an 
        acquisition and should play a stronger role in antitrust 
        enforcement;
            (13) State attorneys general may have critical local 
        knowledge or regional concerns about the competitive effects of 
        an acquisition and should play a stronger role in antitrust 
        enforcement;
            (14) section 7A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 18a) 
        (referred to in this section as ``section 7A'') was enacted to 
        allow the antitrust agencies to review acquisitions before 
        consummation;
            (15) the recent explosion of filings under section 7A has 
        overwhelmed the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of 
        Justice, a phenomenon exacerbated by strict statutory deadlines 
        for the review process and an onerous judicial process to 
        obtain injunctions to block acquisitions likely to lessen 
        competition;
            (16) the antitrust agencies should be empowered to reject 
        acquisitions that they review under section 7A, and those 
        decisions should be treated as reviewable agency actions;
            (17) the use of structural and behavioral remedies to 
        protect competition and prevent monopolistic behavior has 
        proven ineffective across various industries;
            (18) the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of 
        Justice have the authority under existing law to conduct 
        retrospective reviews of any consummated acquisition at any 
        time, regardless of whether the acquisition was nonreportable 
        or the government opposed the acquisition before its 
        consummation;
            (19) because some data about the competitive effects of an 
        acquisition will necessarily emerge after consummation, it is 
        critical that the Federal Trade Commission and the Department 
        of Justice conduct retrospective reviews of acquisitions in 
        order to remedy anticompetitive acquisitions, including through 
        unwinding;
            (20) an acquisition may have competitive effects in markets 
        beyond the lines of commerce of the transaction, particularly 
        when a party has an extensive business ecosystem; and
            (21) excessive market concentration must be remedied to 
        restore and protect competition in the United States and ensure 
        the United States economy and democracy benefit workers, 
        consumers, customer choice, sellers, small and minority-owned 
        businesses (including farms and ranches), local, rural, and 
        low-income communities, communities of color, privacy, quality, 
        entrepreneurship, and innovation.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) ban the most anticompetitive acquisitions;
            (2) restore and protect the competitive process;
            (3) amend section 7A to empower the antitrust agencies to 
        reject acquisitions before consummation through agency action;
            (4) reduce the burdens of contemporary merger litigation 
        placed on Federal and State officials;
            (5) establish a greater role for Federal agencies and State 
        attorneys general in the merger-review process;
            (6) establish procedures for retrospective reviews;
            (7) break up acquisitions consummated during the 21st 
        century that have lessened competition and harmed the 
        competitive process;
            (8) ensure that the structure of the United States economy 
        is competitive and fair in order to safeguard the nation 
        against economic and political oligarchies; and
            (9) uphold the mandate in the Constitution of the United 
        States to promote a flourishing democracy by promoting 
        meaningful competition throughout all segments of the United 
        States economy.

            (1) in the first and second undesignated paragraphs, by 
        striking ``lessen competition, or to tend to create a

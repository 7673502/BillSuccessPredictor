                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit the use of Federal funds to develop, implement, facilitate, 
    or fund any sexually oriented program, event, or literature for 
         children under the age of 10, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop the Sexualization of Children 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Certain school districts that receive Federal grants 
        have implemented sexual education for children under 10 years 
        of age.
            (2) Many newly implemented sexual education curriculums 
        encourage discussions of sexuality, sexual orientation, 
        transgenderism, and gender ideology as early as kindergarten.
            (3) State and local library systems, museums, and other 
        educational institutions that receive Federal grants have 
        purchased sexually oriented literature and materials that 
        target preadolescent children and teach them about concepts 
        like masturbation, pornography, sexual acts, and gender 
        transition.
            (4) Private organizations, State government agencies, and 
        local government agencies have made use of Federal grants to 
        host and promote sexually oriented events like drag queen story 
        hours and burlesque shows.
            (5) Federal agencies like the Department of Defense have 
        used Federal funds to promote and host burlesque shows and drag 
        shows on Federal property during family-oriented events.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) parents and legal guardians have the right and 
        responsibility to determine where, if, when, and how their 
        children are exposed to material of a sexual nature; and
            (2) Federal funds should not be used to expose children 
        under 10 years of age to sexually oriented material.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITING THE PRESENTATION OF SEXUALLY ORIENTED MATERIALS TO 
              CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 10.

    (a) Federal Funds Limitation.--No Federal funds may be made 
available to develop, implement, facilitate, or fund any sexually 
oriented program, event, or literature for children under the age of 
10, including hosting or promoting any program, event, or literature 
involving sexually oriented material, or any program, event, or 
literature that exposes children under the age of 10 to nude adults, 
individuals who are stripping, or lewd or lascivious dancing.
    (b) Prohibition at Federal Facilities.--A federally owned facility 
or property may not be used to host or promote any sexually oriented

    (c) Civil Action.--
            (1) Private right of action.--A parent or legal guardian of 
        a child may bring a civil action for injunctive relief in any 
        Federal district court of appropriate jurisdiction against a 
        government official, government agency, or private entity for a 
        violation of subsection (a) or subsection (b) by such an 
        official, agency, or entity if the child was--
                    (A) exposed to sexually oriented material funded in 
                part or in whole by Federal funds; and
                    (B) under the age of 10 at the time that such 
                exposure occurred.
            (2) Statute of limitations.--An action under this 
        subsection may commence not later than 1 year after a violation 
        occurs under subsection (a) or (b).
            (3) Attorney's fees and other costs.--In any action brought 
        under this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may award 
        a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees, expert 
        witness fees, and other costs of litigation.
    (d) Prohibition on Federal Funds.--
            (1) Administrative enforcement.--The head of a Federal 
        agency may not disburse Federal funds to any Federal program, 
        State or local government agency, or private entity for 3 
        fiscal years if that entity receives 2 or more injunctions for 
        violations of subsection (a) or (b) in a 5-year period.
            (2) Notification.--The appropriate head of a Federal agency 
        shall submit to a government agency or private entity written 
        notice of the prohibition on the disbursement of Federal funds 
        under paragraph (1).
            (3) Appeal.--Not later than 30 days after receiving a 
        notice pursuant to paragraph (2), a government agency or 
        private entity may appeal a prohibition on the disbursement of 
        Federal funds under paragraph (1) in an administrative hearing 
        of the appropriate agency.

    Congress finds the following:

        General and Secretary of Homeland Security with the ability to 
        exercise their discretion in favor of preventing hardship to 
        the spouses, children, and parents of United States citizens in 
        immigration proceedings, on a case-by-case basis, to ensure 
        fairness and prevent hardships associated with family 
        separation.

SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

General or the Secretary of Homeland Security with the ability to 
exercise the discretionary authority provided in this Act, except on a

                in hardship to the alien's United States citizen 
                spouse, parent, or child.

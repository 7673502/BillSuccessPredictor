To conduct a pilot program at foreign last point of departure airports 
   to permit passengers and their accessible property to continue on 
additional flights or flight segments originating in the United States 
   without additional security re-screening, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``One-Stop Pilot Program Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ONE-STOP SECURITY.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding 44901(a) of title 49, United 
States Code, the Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration, in coordination with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection, is authorized to conduct a pilot program at not more than 
six foreign last point of departure airports to permit passengers and 
their accessible property arriving on direct flights or flight segments 
originating at such participating foreign airports to continue on 
additional flights or flight segments originating in the United States 
without additional security re-screening if--
            (1) the initial screening was conducted in accordance with 
        an aviation security screening agreement described in 
        subsection (d);
            (2) passengers arriving from participating foreign airports 
        are unable to access their checked baggage until the arrival at 
        their final destination; and
            (3) upon arrival in the United States, passengers arriving 
        from participating foreign airports do not come into contact 
        with other arriving international passengers or those 
        passengers' property or other persons who have not been 
        screened or subjected to other appropriate security controls 
        required for entry into the airport's sterile area.
    (b) Requirements for Pilot Program.--In carrying out this section, 
the Administrator shall ensure there is no reduction in the level of 
security or specific aviation security standards or requirements for 
screening passengers and their property prior to boarding an 
international flight bound for the United States, including specific 
aviation security standards and requirements regarding the following:
            (1) High risk passengers and their property.
            (2) Weapons, explosives, and incendiaries.
            (3) Screening passengers and property transferring at a 
        foreign last point of departure airport from another airport 
        and bound for the United States, and addressing any co-mingling 
        of such passengers and property with passengers and property 
        screened under the pilot program described in subsection (a).
            (4) Insider risk at foreign last point of departure 
        airports.
    (c) Re-Screening of Checked Baggage.--The Administrator may 
determine whether checked baggage arriving from participating foreign 
airports referenced in subsection (a) must be re-screened in the United 
States by an explosives detection system before such baggage continues 
on any additional flight or flight segment.
    (d) Aviation Security Screening Agreement Described.--An aviation 
security screening agreement described in this subsection is an 
agreement signed by the Administrator, without delegating such 
authority, and entered into with a foreign country that delineates and 
implements security standards and protocols utilized at a foreign last 
point of departure airport that are determined by the Administrator to 
be comparable to those of the United States and therefore sufficiently 
effective to enable passengers and their accessible property to deplane 
into sterile areas of airports in the United States without the need 
for re-screening.
    (e) Re-Screening Requirement.--If the Administrator determines that 
the foreign country participating in the aviation security screening 
agreement has not maintained and implemented security standards and 
protocols comparable to those of the United States at foreign last 
point of departure airports at which a pilot program has been 
established in accordance with this section, the Administrator shall 
ensure that passengers and their property arriving from such airports 
are re-screened in the United States before such passengers and their 
property are permitted into sterile areas of airports in the United 
States. In the case of continued or egregious failure to maintain such 
security standards and protocols, the Administrator shall suspend or 
terminate the aviation security screening agreement, as determined 
appropriate by the Administrator, and shall notify the appropriate 
congressional committees of such suspension or termination, as the case 
may be, not later than seven days after such suspension or termination.
    (f) Certifications and Briefings to Congress.--Not later than 30 
days before an aviation security screening agreement in accordance with 
subsection (d) enters into force, the Administrator shall provide to 
the appropriate congressional committees the following:
            (1) A copy of such agreement.
            (2) A homeland security threat assessment for the country 
        in which such foreign last point of departure airport is 
        located, information on any corresponding mitigation efforts to 
        address any security issues identified in such threat 
        assessment, and the Administrator's plans for ensuring through 
        joint covert testing or other measures compliance with the 
        security standards and protocols set forth in such agreement.
            (3) A certification that such agreement satisfies all 
        requirements specified in subsection (b) or, in the event that 
        one or more of such requirements is not so satisfied, an 
        identification of the unsatisfied requirement and information 
        on what actions will be taken to ensure such remaining 
        requirement is satisfied before such agreement enters into 
        force.
            (4) A certification that the Administrator consulted with 
        stakeholders, including air carriers, airport operators, 
        relevant interagency partners, and other stakeholders the 
        Administrator determines appropriate.
            (5) A detailed briefing on the substance of paragraphs (1) 
        through (4).
    (g) Sunset.--The pilot program described in subsection (a) shall 
terminate six years after the date of enactment of this section.
    (h) Report to Congress.--Not later than five years after the date 
of enactment of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
coordination with the Administrator, shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report regarding the implementation of the 
pilot program described in subsection (a), including information 
relating to the following:
            (1) The impact to homeland security and international 
        aviation security, including any benefits and challenges, of 
        such pilot program.
            (2) The impact to passengers, airports, and air carriers, 
        including any benefits and challenges, of such pilot program.
            (3) The impact and feasibility of continuing such pilot 
        program or expanding into a more permanent program, including 
        any benefits and challenges.
    (i) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
as limiting the authority of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to 
inspect persons and baggage arriving in the United States in accordance 
with applicable law.
    (j) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Administration; tsa.--The terms ``Administration'' and 
        ``TSA'' mean the Transportation Security Administration.

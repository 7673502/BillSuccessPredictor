                                 A BILL


 
  To designate the Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment 
Facility Expansion of the Department of Veterans Affairs Alvin C. York 
   Medical Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, as the ``Sergeant John 
        Toombs Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Facility''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Sergeant John Toombs of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, served 
        in the Tennessee Army National Guard as a part of the highly 
        distinguished 230th Signal Corps.
            (2) His six years in the National Guard included a 
        deployment to Afghanistan, where Sergeant Toombs proudly served 
        as a guard and escort for visiting dignitaries and reporters 
        traveling into highly dangerous, war-ravaged areas in 
        Afghanistan.
            (3) As a result of his service in Afghanistan, Sergeant 
        Toombs developed symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder 
        (PTSD), a disability he continued to suffer from after leaving 
        the National Guard in 2014.
            (4) After two years of battling PTSD and failing to receive 
        the necessary treatment, Sergeant Toombs tragically took his 
        own life in November of 2016.
            (5) However, the life of Sergeant Toombs has impacted other 
        veterans in Tennessee suffering from PTSD. Since this 
        devastating tragedy, positive measures have been made to raise 
        awareness and improve the overall treatment of veterans 
        suffering from PTSD within the Tennessee Valley Healthcare 
        System.

SEC. 2. SERGEANT JOHN TOOMBS RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT 
              FACILITY.

    (a) Designation.--The Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation 
Treatment Facility Expansion of the Department of Veterans Affairs 
Alvin C. York Medical Center in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, shall be known 
and designated as the ``Sergeant John Toombs Residential Rehabilitation 
Treatment Facility'', after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, 
document, paper, or other record of the United States to the Alvin C. 
York Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Facility 
referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the 
``Sergeant John Toombs Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Facility''.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

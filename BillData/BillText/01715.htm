SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY OF STATES AND LOCALITIES TO REGULATE 
              CONDUCT IN RELATION TO RIFLES OR SHOTGUNS.

    Section 927 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``No'' and inserting ``(a) Except as 
        provided in subsection (b), no''; and
            (2) by adding after and below the end the following:
    ``(b)(1) A State or a political subdivision of a State may not 
impose any regulation, prohibition, or registration or licensing 
requirement with respect to the design, manufacture, importation, sale, 
transfer, possession, or marking of a rifle or shotgun that has moved 
in, or any such conduct that affects, interstate or foreign commerce, 
that is more restrictive, or impose any penalty, tax, fee, or charge 
with respect to such a rifle or shotgun or such conduct, in an amount 
greater, than is provided under Federal law. To the extent that a law 
of a State or political subdivision of a State, whether enacted before, 
on, or after the date of the enactment of this subsection, violates the 
preceding sentence, the law shall have no force or effect. For purposes 
of this subsection, the term `rifle or shotgun' includes any part of a 
rifle or shotgun, any detachable magazine or ammunition feeding device, 
and any type of pistol grip or stock design.

awarded.''.

                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit the use of Federal funds for travel expenses of any 
   individual traveling across State lines for purposes of having an 
                   abortion, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Statutory Termination of 
Abortions from Taxpayer-funded Excursions Lines Act'' or the ``Protect 
S.T.A.T.E. Lines Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR TRAVEL EXPENSES OF 
              INDIVIDUALS CROSSING STATE LINES FOR AN ABORTION.

    (a) In General.--No Federal funds may be obligated or expended for 
the travel expenses of any individual traveling across State lines for 
purposes of having an abortion. In this subsection, the term ``State'' 
means any of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and any territory 
or possession of the United States.
    (b) Exception.--The limitation in subsection (a) shall not apply to 
any travel expenses--
            (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or 
        incest; or
            (2) in the case where a woman suffers from a physical 
        disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a 
        life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from 
        the pregnancy itself, that would, as certified by a physician, 
        place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
        performed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

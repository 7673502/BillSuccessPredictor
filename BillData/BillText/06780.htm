SEC. 2. IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING MARKET AND REGULATORY BARRIERS TO 
              HYDROGEN ENERGY.

    (a) Report on Hydrogen Energy Barriers.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
        enactment of this section, the Department of Energy and the 
        Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (in this section referred

                    (A) describing any barriers to the development, 
                deployment, and use of hydrogen as a fuel source for 
                residential, commercial, industrial, and electric power 
                uses, including barriers to the development and 
                deployment of hydrogen transportation and storage 
                infrastructure, caused by--
                            (i) the rules of a Transmission 
                        Organization (as defined in section 3 of the

                    (C) identifying any regulatory, market, 
                procurement, or cost recovery mechanisms that would 
                encourage the development, deployment, and use of 
                hydrogen as a fuel source for residential, commercial, 
                industrial, and electric power uses.
            (2) Public input and technical conference.--In preparing

        comments on a draft report.
    (b) Hydrogen Blending Pilot Program.--
            (1) In general.--The Commission shall establish and carry 
        out a pilot program for hydrogen blending projects in 
        accordance with the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.).
            (2) Requirements.--In carrying out the pilot program under 
        paragraph (1), the Commission shall--

                    (B) establish an application process to determine 
                which hydrogen blending projects may participate in the 
                pilot program;
                    (C) not later than 180 days after the date of

                effectiveness of the pilot program.

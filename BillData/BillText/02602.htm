 To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to provide for wage and 
  economic stabilization in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana 
                    Islands, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Northern Mariana Islands Wage and 
Economic Stability Act''.

SEC. 2. WAGE AND ECONOMIC STABILIZATION IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE 
              NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS.

    Section 6 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(h) In the case of any provision of law enacted during the 10-
year period beginning with 2021 that provides for an increase in the 
minimum wage rate set forth under subsection (a)(1) or (g)(1) of this 
section, section 3(m)(2)(A)(i), or section 14(c)(1)(A), such increase 
shall be applied with respect to employers in the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands beginning on the date that is 18 months later 
than the date on which such provision of law otherwise takes effect.''.

SEC. 3. GAO REPORT.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General shall submit to the Education and Labor Committee 
of the House of Representatives, the Natural Resources Committee of the 
House of Representatives, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Natural 
Resources of the Senate a report that, with respect to the Commonwealth 
of the Northern Mariana Islands--
            (1) assesses the status and structure of the economy 
        (including employment, earnings and wages, and key industries); 
        and
            (2) for each year during the 10-year period beginning with 
        2021 in which an increase will take effect in the minimum wage 
        rate set forth under subsection a(1) or g(1) of section 6, 
        section 3(m)(2)(A)(i), or section 14(c)(1)(A) of the Fair Labor 
        Standards Act of 1938, estimates the proportion of employees 
        who will be directly affected by each such wage increase taking 
        effect for such year, disaggregated by industry and occupation.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to direct the 
Secretary of Labor to carry out a competitive grant program to support 
   community colleges and career and technical education centers in 
  developing immersive technology education and training programs for 
             workforce development, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Immersive Technology for the 
American Workforce Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Rural communities have unique workforce considerations 
        and challenges.
            (2) Almost 25 percent of Americans live in rural 
        communities, and while urban areas have experienced job and 
        population growth, rural communities face static or declining 
        populations and job decline.
            (3) Rural communities were hit harder and recovered more 
        slowly than urban centers during the 2007-2008 recession and 
        have experienced more economic depression and decline in 
        college enrollment due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (4) Rural communities historically have lower rates of 
        postsecondary education, which is a barrier to traditional 
        employment in industries like agriculture and manufacturing.
            (5) It is estimated that by the end of 2022 over half of 
        all employees will require ``significant'' reskilling, which is 
        less expensive than replacing an individual employee.
            (6) Immersive technologies are proving effective in helping 
        rural communities tackle these challenges.
            (7) Technologically mediated training, including augmented 
        reality, virtual reality, mixed reality, and high-tech 
        simulations are increasingly valued as tools to train workers 
        in industries ranging from manufacturing to health care, 
        agriculture to construction, and clean energy to public safety.
            (8) Use of immersive technology permits on-site training 
        and continued education, promotes efficiency, aids recruiting 
        as well as retention, improves communication and collaboration, 
        and increases safety.
            (9) Immersive technologies allow workers to train directly 
        under the supervision and tutelage of more experienced experts 
        who are located outside of the local community.
            (10) These technologies help workers remain well equipped 
        for the demands of the modern economy. As the need for 
        reskilling increases, so will the need for technologies which 
        support American workers rather than replace them.
            (11) Community colleges, area career and technical 
        education centers, and other training providers are uniquely 
        positioned to support rural communities in skills development 
        and workforce training.
            (12) People without a postsecondary credential are 4 times 
        more likely to have a job that can be lost to automation than 
        those who have one, increasing their need to learn new skills 
        in order to remain competitive and employable.
            (13) Community colleges provide education at a lower cost, 
        with most graduates incurring no student debt.
            (14) In addition to providing lower cost workforce 
        development training and skills education applicable across a 
        range of roles and occupations, community colleges serve as 
        large regional employers and critical community hubs.
            (15) Offering grants to community colleges and area career 
        and technical education centers in rural areas to develop and 
        provide immersive technology training programs will help rural 
        communities in the short term and position them for success in 
        the longer term.
            (16) Despite their proven value, community colleges and 
        area career and technical education schools bear significant 
        funding limitations and shortages.
            (17) Providing immersive technology training programs 
        through community colleges can help rural communities retain 
        local talent, whether by providing qualification for new local 
        jobs or for remote employment opportunities with companies 
        headquartered in urban centers that are struggling to fill 
        jobs.
            (18) Immersive technology training partnership with 
        community colleges and area career and technical education 
        schools also complements recent Federal funding for broadband 
        connection and physical infrastructure, the two other biggest 
        hurdles facing rural students and workers seeking reskilling or 
        upskilling.

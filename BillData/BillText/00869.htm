                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize appropriations to offset costs resulting from reductions 
  in research productivity in connection with the Coronavirus Disease 
                2019 (COVID-19), and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Research Investment to Spark the 
Economy Act of 2021'' or the ``RISE Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Federal agencies have provided Federal research 
        awardees flexibility during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
        (COVID-19) pandemic to support graduate and undergraduate 
        students, post-doctoral students, principal investigators, and 
        administrative and technical support staff.
            (2) Federal agencies may need to provide current Federal 
        research awardees extensions to cover time lost in awardee 
        facilities and in the field that will affect the completion of 
        that agencies' research missions and priorities. Additionally, 
        agencies have allowed federally funded laboratories to donate 
        necessary equipment, such as personal protective equipment, to 
        support hospitals and first responders, which may need to be 
        repurchased and will create additional expenses under Federal 
        contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements.
            (3) The United States needs to sustain the critical human 
        infrastructure that undergirds the United States research 
        enterprise, which has created a longstanding government-
        university partnership, that has made the United States the 
        global leader in innovation, strengthening the health of 
        citizens of the United States, the economy of the United 
        States, and national security.
            (4) While the Federal Government has made significant 
        investments in new biomedical research to address COVID-19, 
        existing research has been slowed down or stopped due to COVID-
        19-modified operations of campuses and laboratories.
            (5) Given the modified operations of many university-based 
        and national laboratories due to the pandemic, Congress is 
        concerned that the people who comprise the research workforce 
        (for example, graduate and undergraduate students, post-
        doctoral students, principal investigators, and administrative 
        and technical support staff) and the future health and strength 
        of the United States research enterprise and manufacturing and 
        technology economies, among others, are at risk.
            (6) While the research capacity of the United States has 
        demonstrated that it can absorb shocks and pivot to address 
        immediate national threats, the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic 
        is still growing and unprecedented in duration and effect.
            (7) Without additional funding, future innovations in areas 
        such as quantum, artificial intelligence, robotics, computing, 
        advanced wireless, space exploration, digital agriculture, 
        earth system observation and prediction, health, and science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics education 
        infrastructure will be forestalled as agencies are forced to 
        use future appropriations intended for new research to cover 
        existing awards. The United States must innovate to launch the 
        next 50 years of unparalleled economic leadership and be 
        prepared for any future pandemics.
            (8) It is vital that the Federal Government take measures 
        to help relieve the strain that Federal agencies will be forced 
        to face and sustain the strength of the ability of the United 
        States to remain a global leader in an increasingly competitive 
        global research environment, as other countries continue to 
        make disproportionately large investments in key research 
        areas.

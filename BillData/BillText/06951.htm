    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    (a) Emergency Declaration.--Notwithstanding section 201 of the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1621), Congress declares that--
            (1) the aggression of the Russian Federation against 
        Ukraine constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to the 
        national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United 
        States; and
            (2) a national emergency exists with respect to that 
        threat.
    (b) Import Prohibition.--During the period during which the 
national emergency declared by subsection (a) is in effect, the 
President shall prohibit the importation by any person subject to the 
jurisdiction of the United States of crude oil, petroleum, petroleum 
products, liquefied natural gas, and coal in which the Russian 
Federation or a national of the Russian Federation has any interest.
    (c) Application of Other Provisions.--The provisions of the 
International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), 
including the consultation and reporting requirements, regulatory 
authorities, and enforcement and savings provisions, shall apply to the 
national emergency declared under subsection (a) to the same extent as 
to a national emergency declared by the President and referred to in 
section 202 of that Act (50 U.S.C. 1701).
    (d) Transition of Oil in Transit.--The prohibition under subsection 
(b) shall not apply with respect to crude oil, petroleum, petroleum 
products, liquefied natural gas, and coal that are loaded for transit 
or in transit to the United States on the date of the enactment of this 
Act.

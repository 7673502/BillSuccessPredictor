                                 A BILL


 
  To require a strategy for countering the People's Republic of China.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Taiwan Protection and National 
Resilience Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. STRATEGY FOR COUNTERING THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

    (a) Identification of Vulnerabilities and Leverage.--Not later than 
180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of the Office of 
Federal Procurement Policy, and the Director of the Office of Science 
and Technology Policy, shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report that identifies--
            (1) goods and services from the United States that are 
        relied on by the People's Republic of China such that that 
        reliance presents a strategic opportunity and source of 
        leverage against the People's Republic of China; and
            (2) procurement practices of the United States Armed Forces 
        and other Federal agencies that are reliant on trade with the 
        People's Republic of China and other inputs from the People's 
        Republic of China, such that that reliance presents a strategic 
        vulnerability and source of leverage that the Chinese Communist 
        Party could exploit.
    (b) Strategy.--Not later than 180 days after the submission of the 
report required by subsection (a)--
            (1) the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the 
        Secretary of the Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the 
        Secretary of State, the Director of the Office of Federal 
        Procurement Policy, and the Director of the Office of Science 
        and Technology Policy, shall submit to the appropriate 
        committees of Congress a report, utilizing the findings of the 
        report required by subsection (a), that describes a 
        comprehensive sanctions strategy to advise policymakers on 
        policies the United States and allies and partners of the 
        United States could adopt with respect to the People's Republic 
        of China in response to an invasion of Taiwan by the People's 
        Republic of China that--
                    (A) starves the People's Liberation Army of oil, 
                natural gas, munitions, and other supplies needed to 
                conduct military operations against Taiwan, United 
                States facilities in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and 
                allies and partners of the United States in the region;
                    (B) diminishes the capacity of the industrial base 
                of the People's Republic of China to manufacture and 
                deliver defense articles to replace those lost in 
                operations of the People's Liberation Army against 
                Taiwan, the United States, and allies and partners of 
                the United States; and
                    (C) inhibits the ability of the People's Republic 
                of China to evade United States and multilateral 
                sanctions through third parties, including through 
                secondary sanctions; and
            (2) the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation the 
        Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the Director of 
        National Intelligence, the United States Trade Representative, 
        the Director of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, and 
        the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
        shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report 
        that--
                    (A) identifies critical sectors within the United 
                States economy that rely on trade with the People's 
                Republic of China and other inputs from the People's 
                Republic of China (including active pharmaceutical 
                ingredients, rare earth minerals, and metallurgical 
                inputs), such that those sectors present a strategic 
                vulnerability and source of leverage that the Chinese 
                Communist Party could exploit; and
                    (B) makes recommendations to Congress on steps that 
                can be taken to reduce the sources of leverage 
                described in subparagraph (A) and subsection (a)(1), 
                including through--
                            (i) provision of economic incentives and 
                        making other trade and contracting reforms to 
                        support United States industry and job growth 
                        in critical sectors and to indigenize 
                        production of critical resources; and
                            (ii) policies to facilitate ``near- or 
                        friend-shoring'', or otherwise developing 
                        strategies to facilitate that process with 
                        allies and partners of the United States, in 
                        other sectors for which domestic reshoring 
                        would prove infeasible for any reason.
    (c) Form.--The reports required by subsections (a) and (b) shall be 
submitted in unclassified form but may include a classified annex.
    (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on 
        Armed Services, the Select Committee on Intelligence, the 
        Committee on Finance, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
        Urban Affairs, and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
        Transportation of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on 
        Armed Services, the Committee on Financial Services, the 
        Committee on Energy and Commerce, and the Permanent Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives.

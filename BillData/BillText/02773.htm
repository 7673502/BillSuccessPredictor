    To amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to make 
   supplemental funds available for management of fish and wildlife 
 species of greatest conservation need as determined by State fish and 
               wildlife agencies, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    The purpose of this Act is to extend financial and technical 
assistance to States, territories, the District of Columbia, and Indian 
Tribes, including under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act

species, or recovering species currently listed as a threatened species 
or an endangered species, under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 
U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) or under State law.

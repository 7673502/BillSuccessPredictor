                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Department of Defense to report to Congress on the 
    potential integration of advanced propulsion systems into F-35 
                   aircraft, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Fighter propulsion is one of the few areas in which the 
        United States maintains a clear advantage over near-peer 
        adversaries, specifically China and its threat to the Indo-
        Pacific region.
            (2) The F-35 will be one of the key elements of the 
        frontline fighter forces of the military services and United 
        States allies and partners for decades to come.
            (3) Failure to develop an adaptive cycle engine and make it 
        available for production on the F-35 would constitute a missed 
        opportunity and open a door for United States adversaries to 
        overtake fielded engine technology.
            (4) Maintaining a strong industrial base and competition is 
        critical to supporting the National Defense Strategy.

SEC. 2. ADAPTIVE ENGINE TRANSITION PROGRAM ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR THE 
              F-35A AIRCRAFT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Air Force, in consultation 
with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, 
shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
integration of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program propulsion system 
into the F-35A aircraft.
    (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a) shall 
include the following:
            (1) A competitive acquisition strategy, informed by fiscal 
        considerations, to--
                    (A) integrate the Adaptive Engine Transition 
                Program propulsion system into the F-35A aircraft; and
                    (B) begin, in fiscal year 2027, activities to 
                retrofit all F-35A aircraft with such propulsion 
                system.
            (2) An implementation plan to implement such strategy.
            (3) A schedule annotating pertinent milestones and yearly 
        fiscal resource requirements for the implementation of such 
        strategy.

SEC. 3. ADVANCED PROPULSION SYSTEM ACQUISITION STRATEGY FOR THE F-35B 
              AND F-35C AIRCRAFT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Navy, in consultation with 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, shall 
submit to the congressional defense committees a report on the 
integration of an advanced propulsion system into F-35B and F-35C 
aircraft.
    (b) Elements.--The report required under subsection (a) shall 
include the following:
            (1) An analysis of the effects of an advanced propulsion 
        system on the combat effectiveness and sustainment costs of F-
        35B and F-35C aircraft, including any effects resulting from--
                    (A) increased thrust, fuel efficiency, thermal 
                capacity, and electrical generation; and
                    (B) improvements in acceleration, speed, range, and 
                overall mission effectiveness.
            (2) An assessment of how the integration of an advanced 
        propulsion system may result in--
                    (A) a reduction in dependency on support assets, 
                including air refueling and replenishment tankers; and
                    (B) an overall cost benefit to the Department from 
                reduced acquisition and sustainment for such support 
                assets.
            (3) A competitive acquisition strategy informed by fiscal 
        considerations, the assessment of combat effectiveness under 
        paragraph (1), and consideration of technical limitations--
                    (A) to integrate an advanced propulsion system into 
                F-35B aircraft and F-35C aircraft;
                    (B) to begin, not later than fiscal year 2027, 
                activities to produce all F-35B aircraft and all F-35C 
                aircraft with such propulsion systems; and
                    (C) to begin, not later than fiscal year 2027, 
                activities to retrofit all F-35B aircraft and all F-35C 
                aircraft with such propulsion systems.
    (c) Advanced Propulsion System Defined.--In this section, term 
``advanced propulsion system'' means--
            (1) a derivative of the propulsion system developed for the 
        F-35 aircraft under the Adaptive Engine Transition Program of 
        the Air Force; or
            (2) a derivative of a propulsion system previously 
        developed for the F-35 aircraft.

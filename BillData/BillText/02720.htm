                                 A BILL


 
To provide for domestic sourcing of personal protective equipment, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Make PPE in America Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of 
        the United States supply chains for, and lack of domestic 
        production of, personal protective equipment (PPE).
            (2) The United States requires a robust, secure, and wholly 
        domestic PPE supply chain to safeguard public health and 
        national security.
            (3) Issuing a strategy that provides the government's 
        anticipated needs over the next three years will enable 
        suppliers to assess what changes, if any, are needed in their 
        manufacturing capacity to meet expected demands.
            (4) In order to foster a domestic PPE supply chain, United 
        States industry needs a strong and consistent demand signal 
        from the Federal Government providing the necessary certainty 
        to expand production capacity investment in the United States.
            (5) In order to effectively incentivize investment in the 
        United States and the re-shoring of manufacturing, long-term 
        contracts must be no shorter than three years in duration.
            (6) The United States needs a long-term investment strategy 
        for the domestic production of PPE items critical to the United 
        States national response to a public health crisis, including 
        the COVID-19 pandemic.

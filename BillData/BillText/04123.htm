                                 A BILL


 
 To codify certain rules related to health reimbursement arrangements 
  and other account-based group health plans, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Increasing Health 
Coverage through HRAs Act of 2021''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used 
        for the purchase of private insurance will allow more small 
        businesses to offer access to quality health insurance coverage 
        to their employees.
            (2) Permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used 
        for the purchase of private insurance will increase the number 
        of Americans with health insurance coverage by as many as 
        800,000.
            (3) Permitting health reimbursement arrangements to be used 
        for the purchase of private insurance will significantly 
        increase the number of Americans obtaining coverage in the 
        individual market, leading to more choice, stability, 
        innovation, and lower premiums.
            (4) The administration rule permitting health reimbursement 
        arrangements to be used for the purchase of private insurance 
        ensures that those with pre-existing conditions will not pay 
        more for coverage by requiring workers within each class of 
        employment to be offered the same coverage regardless of health 
        status.

SEC. 2. CODIFICATION OF HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER 
              ACCOUNT-BASED GROUP HEALTH PLANS.

    The final rule (84 FR 28888) published on June 20, 2019, by the 
Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services (relating to health reimbursement 
arrangements and other account-based group health plans) shall have the 
full force and effect of law.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

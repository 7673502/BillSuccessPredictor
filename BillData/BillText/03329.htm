                        population of less than 200,000, the term 
                        `eligible area' shall include an urbanized area

            ``(3) Census phase-out.--Before apportioning funds under 
        subsection (h)(3), for any urbanized area that is no longer an 
        eligible area due to a change in population in the most recent 
        decennial census, the Secretary shall apportion to such 
        urbanized area, for 3 fiscal years, an amount equal to half of 
        the funds apportioned to such urbanized area pursuant to this 
        subsection for the previous fiscal year.''.

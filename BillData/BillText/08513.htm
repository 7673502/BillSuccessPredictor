    ``(d) Applicability.--
            ``(1) Nonretroactivity.--No person who has attained 65 
        years of age before the date of enactment of the Let 
        Experienced Pilots Fly Act may serve as a pilot for an air 
        carrier engaged in covered operations unless--
                    ``(A) such person is in the employment of that air 
                carrier in such operations on such date of enactment as 
                a required flight deck crew member; or
                    ``(B) such person is newly hired by an air carrier 
                as a pilot on or after such date of enactment without 
                credit for prior seniority or prior longevity for 
                benefits or other terms related to length of service 
                prior to the date of rehire under any labor agreement 
                or employment policies of the air carrier.
            ``(2) Protection for compliance.--An action taken in 
        conformance with this section, taken in conformance with a 
        regulation issued to carry out this section, or taken prior to

        proceeding, brought under any employment law or regulation, 
        before any court or agency of the United States or of any State 
        or locality.
    ``(e) Amendments to Labor Agreements and Benefit Plans.--Any

            ``(1) Medical examinations and standards.--Except as 
        provided by paragraph (2), a person serving as a pilot for an 
        air carrier engaged in covered operations shall not be subject 
        to different medical standards, or different, greater, or more 
        frequent medical examinations, on account of age unless the 
        Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration determines 
        (based on data received or studies published after the date of 
        enactment of the Let Experienced Pilots Fly Act) that different 
        medical standards, or different, greater, or more frequent 
        medical examinations, are needed to ensure an adequate level of 
        safety in flight.
            ``(2) Duration of first-class medical certificate.--No 
        person who has attained 60 years of age may serve as a pilot of 
        an air carrier engaged in covered operations unless the person 
        has a first-class medical certificate. Such a certificate shall 
        expire on the last day of the 6-month period following the date 
        of examination shown on the certificate.
    ``(g) Safety Training.--Each air carrier engaged in covered 
operations shall continue to use pilot training and qualification 
programs approved by the Federal Aviation Administration.''.

                                 A BILL


 
   To establish a special enrollment period for family members of an 
 individual who has died by suicide, to establish a competitive grant 
 program to provide services and support to friends and family members 
      impacted by an individual's suicide, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Greater Mental Health Access Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) One in five adults in America experience some form of 
        mental illness, and nearly one in twenty-five adults live with 
        serious mental illness.
            (2) Access to mental health services is a particularly 
        pervasive problem; 28 million residents of the United States 
        are uninsured and have no access to mental health services. 
        Studies show that nearly 60 percent of adults and 50 percent of 
        children with a mental illness did not receive mental health 
        services in the previous calendar year.
            (3) The lack of access to mental health services has, in 
        part, contributed to an increase in the suicide rate in the 
        United States, which is now the tenth leading cause of death in 
        this country.
            (4) In 2017, 47,173 Americans died by suicide.
            (5) In 2017, there were an estimated 1,400,000 suicide 
        attempts in the United States.
            (6) Suicide by a loved one often results in ``suicide 
        contagion''; for surviving family and friends the risk of 
        attempting suicide increases by 65 percent.
            (7) Family and friends who lost a loved one to suicide are 
        80 percent more likely to drop out of school or stop working.
            (8) Access to mental health services is important to 
        mitigate suicide, suicide contagion, and bereavement. Access to 
        care also reduces the financial burden for individuals in need 
        of mental health services.
            (9) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has 
        increased access to mental health services, but there is still 
        a large population that is uninsured or has insufficient 
        coverage to seek mental health services.
            (10) Family and friends who have lost a loved one to 
        suicide should not face hurdles when attempting to access 
        mental health services. As such, a suicide or suicide attempt 
        should constitute a ``qualifying life event'' for any 
        individual who is eligible to enroll, but is not enrolled, in a 
        health benefit plan under the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting the Safety of Air Traffic 
Control and the Aviation System Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Since its establishment in 1958, the Federal Aviation 
        Administration, originally named the Federal Aviation Agency, 
        has been responsible for--
                    (A) promoting the safe flight of civil aircraft in 
                air commerce;
                    (B) ensuring the safe, secure, and efficient use of 
                the national airspace system and provision of air 
                navigation services; and
                    (C) overseeing the certification and continued 
                airworthiness of aircraft and other aeronautical 
                products.
            (2) Congress has repeatedly tasked the Federal Aviation 
        Administration with responsibility for securing the national 
        airspace system, including the air traffic control system, 
        airspace management, civil aircraft, and aeronautical products 
        and articles through safety regulation and oversight. These 
        mandates have routinely included protecting against associated 
        cyber threats affecting aviation safety or the Administration's 
        provision of safe, secure, and efficient air navigation 
        services and airspace management.
            (3) In 2003, Congress passed the Vision 100--Century of 
        Aviation Reauthorization Act, which directed the Federal 
        Aviation Administration to develop and submit a report on an 
        integrated plan to ensure that the Next Generation Air 
        Transportation System meets future air transportation safety, 
        security, mobility, efficiency, and capacity needs.
            (4) In 2012, Congress passed the FAA Modernization and 
        Reform Act of 2012, which directed the Federal Aviation 
        Administration to develop a NextGen Implementation Plan with a 
        detailed description of how the agency is implementing the Next 
        Generation Air Transportation System, and contingency plans for 
        dealing with the degradation of the System in the event of a 
        natural disaster, major equipment failure, or act of terrorism.
            (5) In 2016, Congress passed the FAA Extension, Safety, and 
        Security Act of 2016, which established requirements for the 
        Federal Aviation Administration to enhance the national 
        airspace system's cybersecurity and included mandates for the 
        Administration to--
                    (A) develop a cybersecurity strategic plan;
                    (B) coordinate with other Federal agencies to 
                identify cyber vulnerabilities;
                    (C) develop a cyber threat model; and
                    (D) complete a comprehensive, strategic policy 
                framework to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks 
                to the air traffic control system.
            (6) In 2018, Congress passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 
        2018 which--
                    (A) authorized funding for the construction of 
                Federal Aviation Administration facilities dedicated to 
                improving the cybersecurity of the national airspace 
                system;
                    (B) required the Federal Aviation Administration to 
                publish a 5-year roadmap for the introduction of civil 
                unmanned aircraft systems into the national airspace 
                system with an update on the advancement of 
                technologies needed to integrate unmanned aircraft 
                systems into the national airspace system, including 
                decision making by adaptive systems and cyber physical 
                systems security;
                    (C) required the Federal Aviation Administration to 
                develop a plan to allow for the implementation of 
                unmanned aircraft systems traffic management services, 
                including an assessment of cybersecurity protections, 
                data integrity, and national and homeland security 
                benefits of such a system;
                    (D) mandated that the Federal Aviation 
                Administration consider revising Federal Aviation 
                Administration regulations regarding airworthiness 
                certification to address cybersecurity for avionics 
                systems, including software components and to require 
                that aircraft avionics systems used for flight guidance 
                or aircraft control be secured against unauthorized 
                access and that avionics systems be protected from 
                unauthorized external and internal access;
                    (E) required the Federal Aviation Administration to 
                review and update its comprehensive, strategic policy 
                framework for cybersecurity to assess the degree to 
                which the framework identifies and addresses known 
                cybersecurity risks associated with the aviation 
                system, and evaluate existing short- and long-term 
                objectives for addressing cybersecurity risks to the 
                national airspace system;
                    (F) created a Chief Technology Officer position 
                within the Federal Aviation Administration to be 
                responsible for, among other things, coordinating the 
                implementation, operation, maintenance, and 
                cybersecurity of technology programs relating to the 
                air traffic control system with the aviation industry 
                and other Federal agencies;
                    (G) directed the National Academy of Sciences to 
                study the cybersecurity workforce of the Federal 
                Aviation Administration in order to develop 
                recommendations to increase the size, quality, and 
                diversity of such workforce; and
                    (H) required the Federal Aviation Administration to 
                develop a comprehensive plan to attract, develop, 
                train, and retain talented individuals in the fields of

                integration, digital communications, and cybersecurity.
            (7) Congress has tasked the Federal Aviation Administration 
        with being the primary Federal agency to assess and address the 
        threats posed from cyber incidents relating to United States 
        Government-provided air traffic control and air traffic 
        management services and the threats posed from cyber incidents 
        relating to civil aircraft, aeronautical products and articles, 
        aviation networks, aviation systems, services, and operations, 
        and the aviation industry.
            (8) Since 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration has 
        been addressing cyber vulnerabilities in civil aircraft and 
        aeronautical products and articles during the safety 
        certification process.
            (9) Congress has received and reviewed testimony, 
        briefings, and documentation on the potential risks of cyber 
        incidents relating to Federal Aviation Administration-provided 
        air navigation services and airspace management, civil 
        aircraft, aeronautical products and articles, aviation 
        networks, aviation systems, services, and operations, and the 
        aviation industry. This testimony and documentation demonstrate 
        the complicated and increasingly interconnected relationship 
        between aviation safety; the safe, secure, and efficient 
        provision of air navigation services; and cybersecurity for 
        both Federal Aviation Administration-provided air navigation 
        services and airspace management, and civil aircraft, 
        aeronautical products and articles, aviation networks, aviation 
        systems, services, and operations.
            (10) This testimony and documentation also demonstrate the 
        need for the Federal Aviation Administration to issue specific 
        regulations, policy, and guidance that are standardized and 
        harmonized, where appropriate and consistent with the interests 
        of safety in air commerce and national security with key

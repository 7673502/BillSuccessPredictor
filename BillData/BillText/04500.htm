   To incentivize States to provide robust qualified immunity to law 
             enforcement officers, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement Protection Act 
of 2021''.

              FUNDS.

after the date of enactment of this Act, in order to be eligible to 
receive a grant under a covered grant program, a State or unit of local 
government certify, along with the application for each such grant, 
that the State or unit of local government does not have in place a law 
that provides less qualified immunity to law enforcement officers than 
is described in the holding in Saucier v. Katz (533 U.S. 194 (2001)).
    (b) Covered Grant Program.--In this section, the term ``covered 
grant program'' means each of the following:
            (1) The Community Development Bock Grant Program under 
        title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 
        (42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.).

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``More Opportunities for Veterans

SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF DELIMITING PERIOD FOR EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE 
              BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO FIRST USED VETERAN

    (a) Extension.--Notwithstanding section 3031 or 3321 of title 38, 
United States Code, or any other applicable provision of law 
establishing a delimiting period, the delimiting period for the 
restored entitlement of a covered individual shall be the period, 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, that equals the sum 
of--
            (1) the number of months of restored entitlement; and
            (2) 12 months.
    (b) Application.--Subsection (a) shall apply with respect to a 
covered individual whose delimiting period for the restored entitlement 
of the individual was, as of the day before the date of the enactment 
of this Act, to expire on or after April 1, 2021.
    (c) Notification.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall notify 
covered individuals of the extension of delimiting periods made under 
subsection (a).
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``covered individual'' means an individual--
                    (A) who received restored entitlement; and
                    (B) for whom the delimiting period to use such 
                restored entitlement, as of the date on which the 
                entitlement was restored, was fewer months than the sum 
                of--
                            (i) the amount of months of the restored 
                        entitlement; and
                            (ii) 12 months.
            (2) The term ``restored entitlement'' means the entitlement 
        of an individual to educational assistance under a provision of 
        law referred to in subsection (a) of section 3695 of title 38, 
        United States Code, that was increased by reason of the 
        Secretary of Veterans Affairs determining on or about April 1, 
        2021, that an individual may use assistance under chapter 31 of 
        such title before using educational assistance under such a 
        provision of law without being subject to the 48-month 
        limitation under such section 3695.

seq.) is repealed.
    (b) Transfers in Connection With Repeal.--Notwithstanding the 
proviso in section 10(a)(4) of the Military Selective Service Act (50 
U.S.C. 3809(a)(4)), the Office of Selective Service Records shall not 
be reestablished upon the repeal of the Act. Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the assets, contracts, 
property, and records held by the Selective Service System, and the 
unexpended balances of any appropriations available to the Selective 
Service System, shall be transferred to the Administrator of General 
Services upon the repeal of the Act. The Director of the Office of 
Personnel Management shall assist officers and employees of the 
Selective Service System to transfer to other positions in the 
executive branch.
    (c) Effect on Existing Sanctions.--
            (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person 
        may not be denied a right, privilege, benefit, or employment 
        position under Federal law on the grounds that the person 
        failed to present himself for and submit to registration under 
        section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 U.S.C. 
        3802), before the repeal of that Act by subsection (a).
            (2) A State, political subdivision of a State, or political 
        authority of two or more States may not enact or enforce a law, 
        regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of 
        law to penalize or deny any privilege or benefit to a person 
        who failed to present himself for and submit to registration 
        under section 3 of the Military Selective Service Act (50 
        U.S.C. 3802), before the repeal of that Act by subsection (a). 
        In this section, ``State'' means a State, the District of 
        Columbia, and a territory or possession of the United States.
            (3) Failing to present oneself for and submit to 
        registration under section 3 of the Military Selective Service 
        Act (50 U.S.C. 3802), before the repeal of that Act by 
        subsection (a), shall not be reason for any entity of the U.S. 
        Government to determine that a person lacks good moral 
        character or is unsuited for any privilege or benefit.
    (d) Conscientious Objectors.--Nothing contained in this Act shall 
be construed to undermine or diminish the rights of conscientious 
objectors under laws and regulations of the United States.

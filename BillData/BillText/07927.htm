 among World Health Organization member states, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    Congress finds that absent a United States withdrawal from the 
World Health Organization (WHO), the United States should hold the WHO 
accountable and overhaul its operations, including by--
            (1) ensuring the People's Republic of China is held 
        accountable for the COVID-19 pandemic and for failing to comply 
        with the International Health Regulations;
            (2) ensuring the WHO conducts a thorough investigation into 
        the role that the People's Republic of China played in the 
        origin and spread of COVID-19; and
            (3) ensuring the United States does not relinquish any 
        authorities to the WHO that would supersede any new or existing 
        United States authorities.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO PROPOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE 
              INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS, THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC 
              TREATY, OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT AMONG WORLD HEALTH 
              ORGANIZATION MEMBER STATES.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b) and 
notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds available to any 
Federal department or agency may be used to propose any amendment to 
the International Health Regulations, the Global Pandemic Treaty, or 
any other agreement among World Health Organization member states that 
would supersede or otherwise modify authorities under United States 
law, including authorities relating to required compliance or 
relinquishing reporting or oversight standards.
    (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to the 
use of funds that is approved in advance by an Act of Congress.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS TO PROVIDE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
              WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds available to 
any Federal department or agency may be used to provide contributions 
to the World Health Organization (WHO) unless and until the Secretary 
of State certifies to Congress that--
            (1) the WHO--
                    (A) holds the People's Republic of China 
                accountable for failing to comply with the 
                International Health Regulations; and
                    (B) makes available a report of its findings and 
                actions under subparagraph (A);
            (2) the steps the WHO is taking to ensure China's 
        accountability, including the role China played in the origin 
        and spread of COVID-19; and
            (3) the steps the WHO is taking to strengthen 
        accountability and its ability to be impartial and objective 
        while improving its transparency and its overall effectiveness.

SEC. 4. INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS DEFINED.

    In this Act, the term ``International Health Regulations'' means 
the International Health Regulations adopted by the 58th World Health 
Assembly in 2005 under Resolution WHA58.3.

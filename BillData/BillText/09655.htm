    TITLE I--TRANSITIONING TO AND ESTABLISHING MEDICARE FOR AMERICA

             Subtitle A--Transitional Public Health Option

SEC. 101. ESTABLISHMENT.

    The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this subtitle 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a public health plan 
option that is offered in the individual market through the Federal and 
State Exchanges under title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act to eligible individuals for plan years 2024 and 2025 in 
accordance with this subtitle.

SEC. 102. ELIGIBILITY.

    Subject to subsection (b), an individual is eligible to enroll in 
such public health plan option if the individual is otherwise eligible 
to purchase individual health insurance coverage through an Exchange 
and the individual resides in a rating area in which the Secretary 
makes the public health plan option available.

SEC. 103. BENEFITS.

    (a) In General.--The public health plan option shall be a qualified 
health plan within the meaning of section 1301(a) of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18021(a)) that--
            (1) meets all requirements applicable to qualified health 
        plans under subtitle D of title I of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (other than the requirement under section 
        1301(a)(1)(C)(ii) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 18021(a)(1)(C)(ii))) 
        and title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act;
            (2) provides coverage of the essential health benefits 
        described in section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(b));
            (3) provides silver and gold-level coverage described in 
        section 1302(d)(1)(C) of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18022(d)(1)(C)); and
            (4) provides coverage of comprehensive reproductive health 
        services, including abortion.
    (b) Preemption.--Notwithstanding section 1303(a)(1) of the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18023(a)(1))--
            (1) a State may not prohibit the public health plan option 
        from offering the coverage described in subsection (a)(4); and
            (2) no State law that would prohibit such a plan from 
        offering such coverage shall apply to such plan.

SEC. 104. PREMIUMS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish premium rates for 
the public health plan option that--
            (1) are adjusted based on the applicable rating area;
            (2) are at a level sufficient to fully finance--
                    (A) the costs of health benefits provided by such 
                plans; and
                    (B) administrative costs related to operating the 
                plans;
            (3) comply with the requirements under section 2701 of the 
        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg); and
            (4) ensure that no individual or household will pay more 
        than 8 percent of adjusted gross monthly income toward the 
        monthly premium.
    (b) Federal Subsidies.--Federal subsidies shall be provided to 
ensure that the premium shall be--
            (1) zero in the case of an individual whose annual 
        household income is below 200 percent of the poverty line;
            (2) determined by a linear sliding scale, in the case of an 
        individual whose household income is at least 200 percent of 
        the poverty line, but not more than 600 percent of the poverty 
        line; and
            (3) no individual or household above 600 percent of poverty 
        level will pay more than 8 percent of adjusted gross monthly 
        income toward such monthly premium.

SEC. 105. PROVIDERS AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a rate schedule for 
reimbursing types of health care providers furnishing items and 
services under the public health insurance plan option at rates based 
on rates applied for such items and services under title XVIII of the 
Social Security Act, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, that 
are necessary to maintain network adequacy. The Secretary shall 
establish a rate schedule for items and services not currently covered 
under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, such as dental, vision, 
and hearing benefits, well child visits, and reproductive health 
services, at a level to ensure adequate access to providers.
    (b) Participating Providers.--
            (1) In general.--A health care provider that is a 
        participating provider of services or supplier under the 
        Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act 
        or under the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act on 
        the date of enactment of this title shall be a participating 
        provider for the public health insurance plan option.
            (2) Additional providers.--The Secretary shall establish a 
        process to allow health care providers not described in 
        paragraph (1) to become participating providers for the public 
        health insurance plan option.
            (3) Clarification.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, health care providers may not be prohibited from 
        participating in the public health insurance option for reasons 
        other than their ability to provide covered services. Health 
        care providers and institutions are prohibited from denying 
        covered individuals access to any covered benefits and services 
        because of their religious objections.
    (c) Prescription Drugs.--The Secretary shall apply the provisions 
of section 1860D-11(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-
111(i)) to prescription drugs under the public health plan option in 
the same manner as such provisions apply with respect to applicable 
covered part D drugs under such section.

    (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of the 
United States an account for the receipts and disbursements 
attributable to the operation of the public health plan option.
    (b) Appropriation.--There is appropriated to the account 
established under subsection (a), out of any funds in the Treasury not 
otherwise obligated, such sums as may be necessary to be used by the 
Secretary for purposes of carrying out this part.
    (c) Prohibition of State Imposition of Taxes.--Section 1854(g) of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-24(g)) shall apply to receipts 
and disbursements described in subsection (a) in the same manner as 
such section applies to payments or premiums described in such section.
    (d) Clarification.--Any provision of law restricting the use of 
Federal funds with respect to any reproductive health service shall not 
apply to funds appropriated under subsection (b) or with respect to the 
account under subsection (a).

                may provide for the enrollment of the employees of such 
                employer under Medicare for America. For purposes of 
                the preceding sentence, the term `large employer' means 
                an employer with at least 100 employees or whose annual 
                payroll exceeds $2,000,000.

        under title XXII of the Social Security Act and makes a premium 
        contribution of at least 70 percent.
Such plan shall require a premium contribution from the employer of at 
least 70 percent regardless of whether coverage is for single, spousal, 
or dependent care.
    (b) Obligation.--Large employers shall, with respect to any full-
time employee of such employer--
            (1) offer a qualifying employer-sponsored plan to such

of Health and Human Services shall have authority to set standards for 
determining whether employers or insurers are undertaking any actions

plan and instead to enroll in Medicare for America. An employer 
violating such standards shall be treated as not meeting the 
requirements of subsection (a).

coverage options under Medicare for America as the Secretary deems 
appropriate, including contact information for assistance.

        shall be treated as a single employer for purposes of this

        part-time employee, the employer contribution requirements of 
        paragraph (1) shall be treated as satisfied if the employer 
        contribution with respect to such employee is not less than the 
        part-time employment ratio of the contribution required under 
        paragraph (1).
            (4) Rules related to part-time employment.--For purposes of 
        this subsection--

                week.
                    (B) Part-time employment ratio.--The term ``part-
                time employment ratio'' means, with respect to a part-
                time employee of an employer in a month, a fraction--
                            (i) the numerator of which is the number of 
                        hours in the employee's normal work week; and
                            (ii) the denominator of which is 30 hours.
                    (C) Special rules.--Under rules prescribed by the 
                Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation 
                with the Secretary of the Treasury, in the case of an 
                employee for an employer whose defined work week for 
                full-time employees is less than 30 hours, any 
                reference in this subsection to 30 hours is deemed a 
                reference to the number of hours in the work week so 
                defined.

                basis, or on the basis of a commission, or other 
                contingent or bonus basis, rather than based on an 
                hourly wage.
    (f) Timing and Manner.--Each employer that makes a financial 
contribution under subsection (b)(2) and (c) under this section (other 
than with respect to coverage under a group health plan) shall pay such 
contribution in a form and manner, specified by the Secretary of the 
Treasury, based upon the form and manner in which employer excise taxes

of 1986.
    (g) Non-Discrimination.--
            (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided for in this

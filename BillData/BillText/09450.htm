    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (Public

        capital for entrepreneurs.
            (2) As the rules of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act 
        of 2012 have taken time to be finalized, participation by small

        Regulations (commonly known as ``Regulation CF'') and Rule 504 
        of Regulation D (section 230.504 of title 17, Code of Federal 
        Regulations) is still maturing.
            (3) The Small Business Administration serves as a resource 
        for thousands of small business concerns and entrepreneurs 
        across the United States seeking financing, aid, counsel, and 
        assistance in starting or growing their business.

     To ensure that the right to vote shall not be impaired due to 
                          vaccination status.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Enfranchisement and the 
Rights of Voters regardless of Inoculation Status Act'' or the ``SERVIS 
Act''.

SEC. 2. RIGHT TO VOTE SHALL NOT BE IMPAIRED.

    (a) In General.--It shall be unlawful for any State or political 
subdivision, as such term is used in the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (52 
U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), to require or impose a requirement that a voter 
or voters must present a vaccine passport or otherwise present 
information regarding their vaccination status in order to exercise the 
right to vote, including to vote in person, in any election involving 
any candidate for Federal office.
    (b) Masking Requirement.--A State or political subdivision may 
require that a voter wear a mask in order to enter a polling location 
only if--
            (1) the State or political subdivision makes readily 
        available and at no cost to the voter or any individual who 
        accompanies the voter a mask sufficient to comply with any 
        applicable masking requirement; and
            (2) the State or political subdivision provides reasonable 
        accommodation from such requirement for individuals with a 
        disability as recognized under the Americans with Disabilities 
        Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).
    (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term 
``vaccination status'' means--
            (1) an individual's status based on the voluntary election 
        to receive or not to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; and
            (2) regardless of whether someone has or has not been 
        vaccinated against COVID-19, an individual's status with 
        respect to having or producing proof of such vaccination in the 
        form of a vaccine passport or other medical records that would 
        demonstrate whether an individual has been vaccinated against 
        COVID-19.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

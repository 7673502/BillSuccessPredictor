                National Institutes of Health or other relevant 
                agencies and offices within the Department of Health 
                and Human Services; and
                    (B) involves the sequencing of human genomic 
                information, and collection, analysis, or storage of 
                identifiable, sensitive information, as defined in 
                section 301(d)(4) of the Public Health Service Act (42

        that includes--
                    (A) criteria for how and when to conduct risk 
                assessments for projects that may have national 
                security implications;
                    (B) security controls and training for researchers 
                or entities, including peer reviewers, that manage or 
                have access to such data; and
                    (C) methods to incorporate risk-reduction in the 
                process for funding such projects that may have 
                national security implications;
            (2) not later than 1 year after the risk framework is 
        developed under paragraph (1), develop and implement controls

                with such paragraph; and
                    (B) ensure that data access committees reviewing 
                data access requests for projects that may have 
                national security risks, as appropriate, include 
                members with expertise in current and emerging national 
                security threats, in order to make appropriate 
                decisions related to access to such identifiable, 
                sensitive information; and
            (3) not later than 2 years after the risk framework is 
        developed under paragraph (1), update data access and sharing 
        policies related to human genomic data, as appropriate, based 
        on current and emerging national security threats.
    (c) Congressional Briefing.--Not later than 2 years after the date 
of enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall provide a briefing to the

SEC. 201. RESOURCE ASSESSMENT AND STUDY REQUIRED FOR WITHDRAWAL.

    (a) Resource Assessments Required.--Federal lands and waters may 
not be withdrawn from entry under the mining laws or operation of the 
mineral leasing and mineral materials laws unless--
            (1) a quantitative and qualitative geophysical and 
        geological mineral resource assessment of the impacted area has 
        been completed during the 10-year period ending on the date of 
        such withdrawal or has been certified as current by the 
        Director of the United States Geological Survey; or
            (2) United States Geological Survey, in consultation with 
        the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the United 
        States Trade Representative, conducts a mineral assessment to 
        ensure that the minerals to be withdrawn by a proposed 
        withdrawal does not impede the ability of the United States or 
        its allies to procure a secure supply chain of mineral 
        resources, and in turn, result in negative impacts on--
                    (A) the economic or national security of the United 
                States or an ally of the United States;

                appropriate balance of trade; or

                mineral resources certified as responsibly sourced and 
                not acquired through the use of child or slave labor.
    (b) New Information.--If a resource assessment completed by the 
Director of the United States Geological Survey shows that a previously 
undiscovered deposit is likely present in an area that has been 
withdrawn from entry under the mining laws or operation of the mineral 
leasing and mineral materials laws pursuant to--
            (1) section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management 
        Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1714), the Secretary shall update the 
        existing Resource Management Plan for such area; or
            (2) chapter 3203 of title 54, United States Code, the 
        Secretary shall provide recommendations to the President on 
        appropriate measures to reduce unnecessary impacts that the 
        withdrawal may have on critical mineral exploration, 
        development, and other mining activities.
    (c) Resource Management Plans.--Before a resource management plan 
under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) is updated or completed, the Secretary or Secretary of 
Agriculture, as applicable, shall, in consultation with the Director of 
the United States Geological Survey--
            (1) review a quantitative and qualitative mineral resource

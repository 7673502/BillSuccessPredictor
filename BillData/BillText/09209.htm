    This Act may be cited as the ``Program of All-inclusive Care for

SEC. 2. IMPROVING ACCESS TO AND AFFORDABILITY OF PACE PROGRAMS FOR 
              MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO ARE NOT DUAL ELIGIBLE 
              BENEFICIARIES THROUGH FLEXIBILITY IN RATE SETTING FOR 
              SERVICES NOT COVERED BY MEDICARE.

    (a) In General.--Section 1894 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395eee) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(j) Flexibility in Establishing Premiums for Medicare PACE 
Participants Who Are Not Also Entitled to Benefits Under a State 
Medicaid Program.--
            ``(1) Codification of authority to charge a monthly 
        capitation amount for non-medicare services.--Subject to the 
        succeeding provisions of this subsection, a PACE program 
        operated by a PACE provider under a PACE program agreement in 
        any State may charge a Medicare-only PACE program eligible 
        individual (as defined in paragraph (4)(A)) who is enrolled in 
        such PACE program a monthly capitation payment amount for the 
        provision of non-Medicare services (as defined in paragraph 
        (4)(B)) under the PACE program.
            ``(2) Determination of monthly capitation payment amount.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding section 460.186 
                of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or any 
                successor regulation), the monthly capitation payment 
                amount that may be charged under paragraph (1) shall be 
                determined by the PACE provider operating the PACE 
                program. Such monthly capitation payment amount shall 
                be based on assessments conducted on the Medicare-only 
                PACE program eligible individual who is enrolled in 
                such PACE program by the PACE program interdisciplinary 
                team and shall take into account the health status of

                amount for a Medicare-only PACE program eligible 
                individual under this paragraph, a PACE provider may 
                take into account the services determined necessary for 
                the individual by the PACE program interdisciplinary 
                team based upon their assessment of the individual. A 
                determination described in the preceding sentence shall 
                not be construed as limiting the responsibility of the 
                PACE provider to meet any unforeseen needs or provide 
                for any required services for such individual.
                    ``(B) Authority to adjust monthly capitation 
                amount.--

                        paragraph (1) to a Medicare-only PACE program 
                        eligible individual enrolled in a PACE program

                        decrease based on assessments conducted on such 
                        individual. Any change in the monthly

                        individual shall take effect beginning with the 
                        first day of the first month that begins after 
                        the month during which the plan of care is 
                        developed for such individual based on such an 
                        assessment.
                            ``(ii) Limitation on frequency of

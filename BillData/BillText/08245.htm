 To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants 
      to support community-based coverage entities to carry out a 
comprehensive coverage program that provides to qualifying individuals 
and small businesses health coverage and integrated social determinant 
   of health support services to small business workers that promote

                   retention, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Multi-Share Coverage 
Program Act''.

SEC. 2. GRANTS TO ESTABLISH COMMUNITY MULTI-SHARE COVERAGE PROGRAMS TO 
              ENABLE SMALL BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH

more than 5 grants to support Community Multi-Share Coverage programs. 
Such programs shall--
            (1) reduce the number of uninsured individuals through 
        hospital-community partnership initiatives that provide an 
        affordable health coverage option for such individuals and 
        provide a coverage transition for those limited to coverage 
        through government-sponsored programs;
            (2) promote workforce development for small business by 
        addressing the influencers of health that directly impact 
        employment success and create barriers to exiting Medicaid, 
        resulting in better health and workplace success; and
            (3) support small business economic recovery by allowing 
        small businesses to be competitive in their hiring, and to 
        provide high quality, affordable health coverage to workers who 
        are otherwise hesitant to lose Medicaid eligibility.
    (b) Community Multi-Share Coverage Program Requirements.--For 
purposes of this section, the term ``Community Multi-Share Coverage 
Program'' means a program that satisfies each of the following program 
requirements--
            (1) Physical presence in the community.--The program 
        maintains a physical presence within close geographic proximity 
        to the enrollees it is serving, with a focus on mitigating 
        barriers to engagement by enabling face-to-face interactions 
        between the program staff, enrollees, and community 
        organizations.
            (2) Health coverage.--The program provides enrolled

                services provided by network providers and community 
                resources, and limits co-payments for in-network 
                covered services to levels that do not create a barrier 
                to patient access.
                    (C) Network providers.--Establishes agreements with 
                hospitals and health care providers located within the

                not discriminate based on age, race, ethnicity, 
                religion, gender, or sexual orientation.
                    (B) The program may rescind a qualifying 
                individual's enrollment due to sustained failure to 
                meet minimum engagement thresholds, which shall be 
                participatory and not health-contingent, and provide

        their household size;
            (3) is not enrolled in a qualified health plan during the

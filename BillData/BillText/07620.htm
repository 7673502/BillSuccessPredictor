            (2) The recipient shall ensure students and staff are made

        standards that enable private rights of action.
    (b) Duties.--Each Title IX Coordinator for a local educational 
agency shall ensure the local educational agency's compliance under

following:
            (1) Ensuring that every individual affected by the 
        operations of the local educational agency, including students, 
        parents, guardians, employees, and applicants for admission or 
        employment, is aware of their rights under Federal, State, and 
        local laws and policies against sex discrimination, including 
        title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
        seq.), and that the local educational agency and its employees 
        comply with those laws and policies, including receiving 
        training on the laws and policies.
            (2) Ensuring that notices of nondiscrimination, relevant 
        policies and grievance procedures, and current contact 
        information of all Title IX Coordinators are disseminated 
        broadly and in an age-appropriate manner accessible to all 
        students, parents, guardians, and employees and applicants for

        surveys.
            (6) Overseeing age-appropriate annual sexual harassment 
        prevention education and trainings to school employees and 
        students and ensuring that prevention education and training is 
        inclusive of diverse communities and identities, informed by 
        research, and conducted in partnership with local rape crisis 
        centers, State sexual assault coalitions, or community 
        organizations that work on addressing sex discrimination, 
        including sexual harassment in schools.
    (c) Waiver Authorized.--
            (1) In general.--A recipient described in subsection (a) 
        may request a waiver from the Secretary of Education of one or 
        more of the requirements under such subsection on the basis 
        that the requirement poses an insurmountable financial burden 
        to the recipient and the recipient has been unable to secure 
        sufficient grants under subsection (d).
            (2) Alternative plan.--The waiver process shall include 
        requiring the recipient to submit an alternative plan for 
        ensuring students are aware of their rights under title IX of 
        the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) and 
        have access to a Title IX Coordinator. At the very minimum 
        within their alternative plan, the recipient shall establish a 
        partnership, through a memorandum of understanding, with a 
        local rape crisis center or a national or community-based 
        organization that specializes in trauma or crisis management 
        and support. The memorandum of understanding shall establish a 
        clear delineation of the roles and responsibilities of the 
        partners, which shall also include providing preventative 
        training and supporting measures when addressing reports about 
        incidents of campus sexual violence.
            (3) Failure to follow alternative plan.--If a recipient has 
        such a waiver approved but does not follow their alternative 
        plan, or the Secretary of Education deems their plan was 
        insufficient to prevent and respond to sexual harassment and 
        assault, the Secretary shall take such action as may be 
        appropriate to withhold Federal financial assistance. A waiver 
        granted under this subsection shall be valid for 2 years.
    (d) Grants.--To carry out this section, there are authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary of Education $100,000,000 for grants to 
recipients described in subsection (a) to offset the financial burden 
of satisfying the requirements of this section. In making grants under 
this subsection, priority shall be given to local educational agencies 
that otherwise would face a high financial burden in fulfilling such 
requirements.
    (e) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Title IX Coordinator'' 
means the employee of a recipient of Federal financial assistance (as 
such term is defined in section 7501(a)(5) of title 31, United States 
Code) with major responsibility for coordinating the recipient's 
efforts to comply with its obligations under title IX of the Education 
Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.).

SEC. 3. GRANTS FOR TRAINING ON HOW TO RESPOND TO SIGNS OF SEXUAL 
              HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT OF STUDENTS.

    There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of 
Education $50,000,000 for grants to local educational agencies (as 
defined in section 8101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
of 1965 (8 U.S.C. 7801)) to train elementary and secondary school 
teachers and other school staff on how to prevent, recognize, and 
respond to signs of sexual harassment and assault among students or 
between students and adults, as well as sexual grooming of students by 
adults at school.

individual student, in which case, an alternate basis for 
disaggregation shall be selected.

(b) shall be made publicly available on the website of the Department 
of Education and readily accessible to and usable by individuals, 
including individuals with disabilities.

        any online consumer tool offered or supported by the Department 
        of Education that provides information to students regarding 
        specific postsecondary educational institutions; and
            (2) shall submit such report to the Congress.

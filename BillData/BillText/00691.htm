SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Opportunity through Pre-
Apprenticeships Act''.

SEC. 2. PRE-APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM STANDARDS.

    (a) In General.--In this Act, a ``pre-apprenticeship program'' 
means a program--
            (1) designed to--
                    (A) assist individuals who do not meet minimum 
                qualifications for an apprenticeship program; and
                    (B) prepare such individuals to enter and succeed 
                in such an apprenticeship program, including by 
                providing the skills and competency attainment needed 
                to enter the apprenticeship program; and
            (2) that meets the requirements described in subsections 
        (b) and (c).
    (b) Requirements.--The program--
            (1) is carried out in partnership with at least one sponsor 
        of an apprenticeship program;
            (2) demonstrates the existence of an active advisory 
        partnership with an industry or sector partnership to inform 
        the training and education services necessary for a pre-
        apprenticeship program;
            (3) demonstrates evidence of sufficient openings in an 
        apprenticeship program at the completion of a pre-
        apprenticeship program to support a transition from a pre-
        apprenticeship to an apprenticeship;
            (4) has strategies in place with apprenticeship programs 
        that will increase employment opportunities for individuals 
        with barriers to employment and create a diverse talent 
        pipeline, such that, upon completion of a pre-apprenticeship 
        program, they will meet the entry requirements for success in 
        such programs;
            (5) has plans in place, either directly or through 
        partnerships, to provide supportive services to pre-
        apprentices, to support the recruitment, retention, and 
        completion of the program;
            (6) provides hands-on training to participants, when 
        possible, that does not supplant the work of a full-time, paid 
        employee but accurately simulates the occupational conditions 
        of a partnering apprenticeship program, with proper supervision 
        and safety protocols; and
            (7) provides a certificate of completion by the State 
        apprenticeship agency, awarded to each individual who completes 
        the program requirements set forth by the plan sponsor.
    (c) Written Plan Requirements.--The program includes a written plan 
developed by the sponsor that--
            (1) provides for work-based learning in which an industry 
        or sector partnership and a related instruction provider 
        collaborate to provide training that will introduce 
        participants to the skills, competencies, and materials used in 
        one or more apprenticeable occupations;
            (2) is based on and aligned with national, State, regional, 
        or local industry standards for high-skill, high-wage, or in-
        demand industry sectors or occupations and the requirements of 
        the related apprenticeship program;
            (3) ensures all individuals have an equal opportunity to 
        participate in the program, as required by section 30 of title 
        29, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the date of 
        enactment of this Act), and that the program will provide 
        adequate and safe equipment, environments, and facilities for 
        training and supervision, free from discrimination (including 
        harassment and retaliation);
            (4) ensures the program has remote instruction contingency 
        plans, if feasible, including providing educational technology 
        that aids in regular and substantive interactions between pre-
        apprentice and classroom instructor;
            (5) provides training and professional development for 
        instructors and staff to use technology and services, including 
        for remote instruction;
            (6) to the extent appropriate and practicable includes 
        enabling an individual to attain a secondary school diploma or 
        its recognized equivalent, and at least 1 recognized 
        postsecondary credential; and
            (7) includes activities designed for career exposure, 
        career planning, and career awareness.

    (a) Establishment.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator of the United States 
        Agency for International Development (USAID) shall establish 
        within the Office of Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment of 
        USAID a rural mobility program (in this section referred to as 
        the ``program'') to carry out the purposes described in 
        paragraph (2), including through grants made to eligible 
        nongovernmental partner organizations, prioritizing those 
        organizations with demonstrated success conducting rural 
        mobility programs in the region to so carry out such purposes.
            (2) Purpose.--The program shall focus on country-driven 
        projects within sub-Saharan Africa to--
                    (A) promote rural communities' access to critical 
                services and opportunities, including education, health 
                care, and livelihood opportunities, through access to 
                affordable, fit-for-purpose bicycles; and
                    (B) provide support to sustainably increase access 
                to critical services such as education, health care, 
                and livelihood opportunities in rural areas, including 
                through support for rural-based mechanics, access to 
                spare parts, reduction of social and gender-based 
                stigma, and community project management capacity.
            (3) Partnerships.--To the greatest extent practicable, the 
        program shall partner with existing entities overseas that have 
        successful models for providing access to affordable bicycles 
        to achieve development objectives.
            (4) Authorization of appropriations.--To carry out this 
        section, there is authorized to be appropriated--
                    (A) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2023;
                    (B) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 2024;

        by USAID during each of fiscal years 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022

                learned from such projects.

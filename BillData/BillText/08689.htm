        there is--
                    ``(i) a fatality or significant injury of any 
                individual, regardless of whether the individual was on 
                board the commercial launch vehicle at the time of the 
                accident; or
                    ``(ii) substantial damage to property that is not

    (b) Other Investigative Agencies.--Section 1131(a)(2) of title 49,

    ``(D) The Board shall seek to enter into a memorandum of agreement

            ``(i) a commercial space transportation accident that may 
        be investigated by the Board under subparagraph (F) or (G) of 
        paragraph (1) will instead be investigated by the other

redesignated by this Act).

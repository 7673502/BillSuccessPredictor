 To direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to 
      issue or revise regulations to provide for temporary flight 
        restrictions in the vicinity of outdoor music festivals.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Outdoor Concerts Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS FOR OUTDOOR CONCERTS OR MUSIC 
              FESTIVALS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue or revise regulations to ensure that the 
Federal Aviation Administration issues a Notice to Airmen designating 
an area of airspace in which a temporary flight restriction applies 
when the Administrator determines that a temporary flight restriction 
is necessary to protect persons or property on the surface or in the 
air, to maintain air safety and efficiency, or to prevent the unsafe 
congestion of aircraft in the vicinity of an outdoor concert or music 
festival with an attendance of not fewer than 30,000 people per day.
    (b) Relationship to Existing Regulations.--In issuing regulations 
under subsection (a), the Administrator, to the extent practicable, 
shall treat an outdoor concert or music festival in the same manner as 
an aerial demonstration or major sporting event is treated under 
section 91.145 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

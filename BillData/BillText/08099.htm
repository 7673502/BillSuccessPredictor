written report which includes--
            (1) the total number of private activity bonds for 
        qualified broadband projects issued by States and their 
        political subdivisions,
            (2) the number of such projects that have been completed,
            (3) the number of such projects that defaulted or were not 
        completed,
            (4) the increase in the number of individuals with access

representatives of the Governor of each State as well as 
representatives of the three largest private internet service providers 
in each State measured by annual reported revenue, including input 
related to the identification of any provision of Federal law, or lack 
thereof, which limits the volume of investment in private activity 
bonds for qualified broadband projects, including census mapping, 
right-of-way and easement issues, competition with existing grant 
programs, or any other matter which limits such investment. If the 
representatives appointed by any Governor under the preceding sentence 
do not include at least one representative of an internet service 
provider that primarily services rural communities and at least one 
representative of an internet service provider organized as a 
cooperative, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Federal 
Communications Commission shall solicit input from one or more of such 
representatives without regard to whether they have been appointed by 
such Governor. The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent 
that a State does not have at least one of the internet service 
providers described in such sentence.

To require the Corps of Engineers to take certain actions with respect 
 to rental amounts and administrative fees charged to certain marinas,

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Marina concessionaires, individually and collectively, 
        allow the Corps of Engineers to fulfill their responsibility to 
        enhance public usage and enjoyment of Corps of Engineers 
        facilities.
            (2) Leases for commercial concession purposes provide a 
        direct benefit to the public and the Federal Government.
            (3) The Corps of Engineers lacks a coordinated schedule or 
        assessment for charging administrative fees to concessionaires 
        across all Corps of Engineers districts.

SEC. 3. RENTAL AMOUNTS, FEES, AND LEASE PERIODS FOR COVERED MARINAS.

    (a) Limitation on Rental Amounts.--In determining the amount of 
rent charged to the operator of a covered marina for a covered lease, 
the Secretary shall, for purposes of applying the Revised Graduated 
Rental System--
            (1) exclude from the total gross receipts calculation the 
        combined covered receipts; and
            (2) establish a percentage rate applicable to such combined 
        covered receipts of not more than 1 percent.
    (b) Fee Schedules for Administrative Fees.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish, for covered 
        leases, a standardized fee schedule for administrative fees 
        assessed to operators of covered marinas, applicable to all 
        Corps of Engineers districts, that specifies under what 
        circumstances and at what time such a fee is to be assessed.
            (2) Limitations.--
                    (A) Amounts.--The Secretary may assess, for a

                        $50,000 to the operator of a covered marina 
                        only for--
                                    (I) activities involving land 
                                disturbances that require a major 
                                review effort, coordination and 
                                concurrence with State agencies, other 
                                Federal agencies, or Tribal

                                Engineers; and
                                    (II) activities relating to lease

                        for activities (not involving land 
                        disturbances) that require a moderate review 
                        effort, which may involve coordination and 
                        concurrence with State agencies, other Federal 
                        agencies, or Tribal governments; and

                extension of lease terms, or activities relating to

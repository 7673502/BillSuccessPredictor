            ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), for the 8-
        quarter period beginning with the first calendar quarter during 
        which a qualifying State (as defined in paragraph (4)) expends 
        amounts for all newly eligible individuals described in section 
        1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) under the State plan (or waiver of such 
        plan), the Federal medical assistance percentage determined 
        under subsection (b) for such State shall be increased by 5 
        percentage points.
            ``(2) Exception.--In the case of a State that ceases to 
        provide medical assistance to any newly eligible individual 
        under the State plan (or waiver of such plan) during a quarter 
        occurring during the period described in paragraph (1), the 
        increase described in such paragraph shall not apply with 
        respect to such State and such quarter (or any succeeding 
        quarter).
            ``(3) Special application rules.--Any increase described in 
        paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) shall not apply with respect to 
                disproportionate share hospital payments described in 
                section 1923;
                    ``(B) shall not be taken into account in 
                calculating the enhanced FMAP of a State under section 
                2105; and
                    ``(C) shall not be taken into account for purposes 
                of part A, D, or E of title IV.
            ``(4) Definition.--For purposes of this subsection, the 
        term `qualifying State' means a State which has not expended 
        amounts for all newly eligible individuals described in section 
        1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) before the date of the enactment of 
        this subsection.''.

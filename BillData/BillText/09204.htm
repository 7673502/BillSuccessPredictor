SEC. 2. RESEARCH AND EVALUATION OF RECYCLED PLASTIC MODIFIED ASPHALT.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall develop a 
research program to review and evaluate the use of recycled plastic 
modified (referred to in this section as ``RPM'') asphalt mixtures and 
mixtures using additives derived from recycled plastics.
    (b) Research Program.--In carrying out subsection (a), the

        transportation, and representatives from academia with 
        expertise in recycling plastic modification;
            (2) evaluate the effects of RPM asphalt mixtures on long-
        term pavement performance, emissions, binder aging, plant and 
        construction operations, and re-recyclability;
            (3) use experimental sections at test tracks and 
        accelerated loading facilities to quickly gain an understanding 
        of long-term performance for RPM asphalt mixtures;
            (4) enter into cooperative agreements with institutions of 
        higher education and non-profit organizations for research and

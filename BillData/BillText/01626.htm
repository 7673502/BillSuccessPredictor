  To reimburse the States for border security expenses, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``State Border Security Reimbursement 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Border security is primarily a Federal responsibility.
            (2) Due to failures of the Federal Government, the State of 
        Texas has been forced to provide resources for border security.
            (3) Since the 2008-2009 biennium budget, Texas has 
        allocated more than $3,208,000,000 for border security in 
        Texas' biennium budget disaggregated, as follows:
                    (A) In 2008-2009, Texas allocated more than 
                $110,000,000 for border security.
                    (B) In 2010-2011, Texas allocated more than 
                $120,000,000 for border security.
                    (C) In 2012-2013, Texas allocated more than 
                $222,100,000 for border security.
                    (D) In 2014-2015, Texas allocated more than 
                $510,000,000 for border security.
                    (E) In 2016-2017, Texas allocated more than 
                $800,000,000 for border security.
                    (F) In 2018-2019, Texas allocated more than 
                $663,100,000 for border security.
                    (G) In 2020-2021, Texas allocated more than 
                $782,800,000 for border security.
                    (H) For 2022-2023, the State of Texas Legislative 
                Budget Board is currently recommending an additional 
                $797,100,000 for border security.
            (4) Citizens of border States are being taxed twice for the 
        same purpose.
            (5) States using their taxpayer dollars and allocating 
        State budgets to meet public safety obligations, which fall 
        under Federal responsibilities, imposes an undue burden on the 
        State.

SEC. 3. REIMBURSEMENT.

    (a) Qualification.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 
States that have expended more than $2,500,000,000 on border security 
and enforcement in support of Federal efforts in the ten years prior to 
the date of the enactment of this Act shall have all associated 
expenses reimbursed.
    (b) Application.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Governors of eligible States shall submit--
            (1) an accounting of all non-federally funded border 
        security expenses incurred by the State and its municipalities; 
        and
            (2) the total sum of such expenses.
    (c) Reimbursement.--Not later than 1 year after the date on which 
the State submits the application pursuant to subsection (b), the 
Federal Government shall reimburse such expenses pursuant to subsection 
(a).
                                 &lt;all&gt;

  To direct the National Science Foundation to commission a study on 
                               inflation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Combatting Painful Inflation (CPI) 
Act''.

    Not later than 45 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Director of the National Science Foundation shall commission a study 
to--
            (1) measure the economic impact of inflation on the 
        American people, including an analysis of cost-of-living 
        impacts;
            (2) assess how the increase in inflation has harmed the 
        American workforce through decreased, less valuable wages;
            (3) consider the impact of inflation on American 
        international competitiveness, particularly as it relates to 
        offshoring jobs in the manufacturing industry;
            (4) evaluate the impact of inflation on rural and 
        underserved communities throughout the country;
            (5) assess the ways inflation at its current trajectory 
        could impact future American generations; and
            (6) make recommendations to Congress on the impact of 
        further Government spending in regard to inflation.

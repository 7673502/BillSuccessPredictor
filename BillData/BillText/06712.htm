  To amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to 
  require a certain percentage of COPS grant funds to be used for the 
   salaries and benefits of school resource officers, and for other 
                               purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``School Resource Officer Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) a school resource officer program provides a safe 
        learning environment in our Nation's schools, provides valuable 
        resources to school staff members, and fosters positive 
        relationships between youth and law enforcement;
            (2) school resource officers are educators, informal 
        counselors and mentors, and law enforcement officers;
            (3) local agencies need the resources and flexibility to 
        establish school resource officer programs that will encourage 
        partnerships between schools and local law enforcement agencies 
        to develop innovative ways to make schools safe; and
            (4) Federal grants for school resource officer salaries are 
        intended to be a starting point for continued local action and 
        should not divert current designated funding.

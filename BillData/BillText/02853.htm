  To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, with respect to 
 eligibility for approval of a subsequent generic drug, to remove the 
   barrier to that approval posed by the 180-day exclusivity period 
 afforded to a first generic applicant that has not yet received final 
                   approval, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bringing Low-cost Options and 
Competition while Keeping Incentives for New Generics Act of 2021'' or 
the ``BLOCKING Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. CHANGE CONDITIONS OF FIRST GENERIC EXCLUSIVITY TO SPUR ACCESS 
              AND COMPETITION.

    Clause (iv) of section 505(j)(5)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(B)) is amended--
            (1) in subclause (I), after ``180 days after the date of 
        the first commercial marketing of the drug (including the 
        commercial marketing of the listed drug) by any first 
        applicant'' by inserting ``or by an applicant whose application 
        is approved pursuant to subclause (III)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subclause:
                    ``(III) Applicant approval.--An application 
                containing a certification described in paragraph 
                (2)(A)(vii)(IV) that is for a drug for which a first 
                applicant has submitted an application containing such 
                a certification can be approved notwithstanding the 
                eligibility of a first applicant for the 180-day 
                exclusivity period described in subclause (II)(aa) if 
                each of the following conditions is met:
                            ``(aa) The approval of such an application 
                        could be made effective, but for the 
                        eligibility of a first applicant for 180-day 
                        exclusivity under this clause.
                            ``(bb) At least 30 months have passed since 
                        the date of submission of an application for 
                        the drug by at least one first applicant.
                            ``(cc) Approval of an application for the 
                        drug submitted by at least one first applicant 
                        is not precluded under clause (iii).
                            ``(dd) No application for the drug 
                        submitted by any first applicant is approved at 
                        the time the conditions under items (aa), (bb), 
                        and (cc) are all met, regardless of whether 
                        such an application is subsequently 
                        approved.''.

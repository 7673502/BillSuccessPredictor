                                 A BILL


 
    To require the Secretary of State to submit an annual report to 
 Congress regarding the ties between criminal gangs and political and 
                       economic elites in Haiti.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Criminal Collusion 
Transparency Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) According to a United Nations estimate, approximately 
        167 criminal gangs operated in Haiti in October 2021, exerting 
        territorial control over as much as two-thirds of the country.
            (2) Haitian armed criminal gangs, the most prominent of 
        which are the G9 Family and Allies and 400 Mawozo gangs, 
        conduct violent crimes, including murder, rape, arms and drug 
        trafficking, racketeering, kidnapping, and blockades of fuel 
        and aid deliveries. These crimes have perpetuated the ongoing 
        security and humanitarian crises in Haiti, which have worsened 
        since the assassination of President Jovenel Moise on July 7, 
        2021.
            (3) The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
        Human Rights and the Human Rights Service jointly found a 333 
        percent increase in human rights violations and abuses against 
        the rights to life and security in Haiti between July 2018 and 
        December 2019.
            (4) At least 19,000 Haitians were forcibly displaced during 
        2021 due to rising criminal violence.
            (5) At least 803 kidnappings were reported in Haiti during 
        the first 10 months of 2021, including the kidnapping of more 
        than 16 United States citizens, giving Haiti having the highest 
        per capita kidnapping rate of any country in the world.
            (6) There is significant evidence of collusion between 
        criminal gangs and economic and political elites in Haiti, 
        including members of the Haitian National Police, which has 
        resulted in widespread impunity and directly contributed to 
        Haiti's current security crisis.
            (7) On December 10, 2020, the Office of Foreign Assets 
        Control of the Department of the Treasury designated former 
        Haitian National Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former 
        Director General of the Ministry of the Interior Fednel 
        Monchery, and former Departmental Delegate Joseph Pierre 
        Richard Duplan under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
        Accountability Act for their connections to armed criminal 
        gangs, including organizing the November 2018 La Saline 
        massacre.

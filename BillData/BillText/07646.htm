                        no more practicable means is available under 
                        the provisions of this Act, including paragraph 
                        (1), to eliminate the risk described in 
                        paragraph (1)(A); or
                            ``(ii) otherwise determines that it is 
                        necessary to notify the public about an 
                        emerging signal concerning a device in order to 
                        reduce or limit the number of patients exposed 
                        to a potential risk identified based on an 
                        emerging signal.
                    ``(B) Definition of emerging signal.--In this 
                paragraph, the term `emerging signal' means new 
                information about a marketed device--
                            ``(i) that supports a new causal 
                        association or a new aspect of a known 
                        association between the device and an adverse 
                        event or set of adverse events; and

                        conducted an initial evaluation and determined 
                        that the information has the potential to 
                        impact patient management decisions or the 
                        known benefit-risk profile of the device.
                    ``(C) Reliance on scientific evidence.--In 
                considering and taking actions under this section, the 
                Secretary shall--

                        credible scientific evidence, such that

                        lacks sufficient strength of evidence shall not 
                        constitute an emerging signal or otherwise 
                        provide a basis for notification under this 
                        paragraph.
                    ``(D) Content of public notification.--Any public 
                notification under this paragraph shall--
                            ``(i) include a description of the device 
                        or devices to which the notification applies;
                            ``(ii) reflect a totality of the evidence 
                        on which the notification is based; and

                        the manufacturer or manufacturers.

                credible scientific evidence is presented to the 
                Secretary that contradicts or modifies the information 
                that serves as a potential basis for a public 
                notification under this paragraph, the Secretary shall 
                include such scientific evidence in the public 
                notification in a manner that provides the intended 
                audience with a complete understanding of the overall 
                nature of information concerning the potential risk.

                        manufacturers of the device or devices at issue 
                        the credible scientific evidence that is the 
                        basis for considering the public notification 
                        and the Secretary's initial evaluation of such

                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Director of the National Science Foundation to award 
 grants for, and support research on, the development of makerspaces, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Making Advances Kinetic Education, 
Research, and Skills Act'' or the ``MAKERS Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Maker communities can be found in both rural and urban 
        communities throughout the Nation.
            (2) Making has been shown to engage and motivate children 
        and adults in STEM disciplines.
            (3) Informal education and makerspaces promote skills that 
        employers desire, such as technical skills, problem-solving 
        skills, teamwork, and analytical skills.
            (4) Studies have shown that underrepresented populations 
        often have better successes in informal and out-of-school STEM 
        than in formal STEM programs.
            (5) Some studies have shown that makerspaces help to build 
        not only technical hard skills but also collaboration and other 
        soft skills that employers desire.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to encourage the formation and study of 
makerspaces to--
            (1) engage populations within community colleges and 
        community environments in STEM programs;
            (2) develop desirable STEM technical and other skills 
        including collaboration; and
            (3) build a STEM-capable workforce.

                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the transfer of certain defense articles and services to 
                    Taiwan, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Accelerating Arms Transfers to 
Taiwan Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States is committed to providing Taiwan arms 
        of a defensive character under section 2(b)(5) of the Taiwan 
        Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301(b)(5)) and under the Six 
        Assurances.
            (2) The rapid military modernization undertaken by the 
        People's Liberation Army has progressively sifted the balance 
        of power in the Taiwan Strait so that it is increasingly likely 
        that the People's Republic of China will assess that it is 
        viable to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
        means.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the United States and Taiwan have 
not sufficiently sought to expedite the delivery of arms to Taiwan.

SEC. 4. PRIORITY FOR DELIVERY OF EXCESS DEFENSE ARTICLES TO TAIWAN.

    Section 516(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321j(c)(2)) is amended by striking ``and to the Philippines'' and 
inserting ``, to the Philippines, and to Taiwan''.

SEC. 5. USE OF SPECIAL DEFENSE ACQUISITION FUND.

    The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of 
State, shall seek to utilize the Special Defense Acquisition Fund 
established under chapter 5 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
2795 et seq.) to expedite the procurement and delivery of defense 
articles and defense services for the purpose of assisting and 
supporting the armed forces of Taiwan.

SEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT OF WAR RESERVE STOCKPILE IN TAIWAN.

    Section 514(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321h(c)(2)) is amended by inserting after ``Thailand'' the following 
``, Taiwan''.

                be required by Taiwan but the delivery of which was or 
                will be prioritized for another country over the 
                delivery of such articles to Taiwan.
            (2) Current and prospective uses of the Special Defense

        the anticipated defense articles and services that Taiwan will

        emergencies, the cost of such articles and services, and the 
        capacity of the United States to provide such articles and

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to provide 
 equal coverage of in vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests 
 for allergies under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Allergy Testing Access Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Allergies, when not properly diagnosed, cannot be 
        effectively treated.
            (2) Allergies to food, inhaled particles, or other sources 
        can cause debilitating and, in some cases, fatal reactions.
            (3) Allergies can substantially compound other illnesses, 
        including asthma, emphysema, and adult obstructive pulmonary 
        diseases, leading to social and economic costs for families and 
        our Nation's health care system.
            (4) According to clinical guidelines from the National 
        Institutes of Health and recommendations from peer-reviewed 
        literature, in vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests 
        are considered equivalent as confirmatory tests in terms of 
        their sensitivity and accuracy.
            (5) Despite these recommendations, some current Medicare 
        local coverage determinations and Medicaid coverage policies 
        deny equal access to in vitro specific IgE tests and 
        percutaneous tests.
            (6) In vitro specific IgE tests and percutaneous tests must 
        be equally accessible for clinicians and patients to improve 
        health outcomes, reduce system costs, and reduce current health 
        care disparities caused by the lack of equal coverage.

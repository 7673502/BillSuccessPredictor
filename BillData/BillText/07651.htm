            ``(4) Requirements for effectiveness.--The energy 
        conservation standards established under this section shall not 
        become effective unless--
                    ``(A) the requirement for consultation with the 
                Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under 
                subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section has been met, 
                including through analysis of data of the Department of 
                Housing and Urban Development regarding projected 
                homebuyer cost increases resulting from the standards 
                and estimates of such Secretary of the number of 
                potential manufactured homebuyers that will no longer 
                qualify for a manufactured home loan as a result of the 
                standards;
                    ``(B) the required findings that the energy 
                efficiency standards are cost-effective and that there 
                is not a more stringent standard that would be cost-
                effective are made and documented through calculations 
                that reflect projected homeowner annual mortgage costs 
                and projected homebuyer downpayment increases resulting 
                from the standards; and
                    ``(C) the final proposed standards fully take into 
                consideration manufactured housing construction methods 
                and transportation requirements.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d) Final HUD Authority.--In compliance with the National 
Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (42 
U.S.C. 5401 et seq.), any manufactured housing energy efficiency 
standards established by the Secretary of Energy under subsection (a) 
and any enforcement authority provided under subsection (c) with 
respect to such standards shall not become effective until the 
standards are adopted pursuant to authority under section 604(a) of 
such Act (42 U.S.C. 5403(a)), after consideration by the manufactured 
housing consensus committee established pursuant to section 604(a)(3) 
of such Act, and shall be subject to the authority under such section 
604 to revise such standards before adoption.''.

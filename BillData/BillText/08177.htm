                                 A BILL


 
 To extend child welfare support and services for youth under 21 years 
 of age, and to allow youth to re-enter foster care after attaining 18 
years of age without regard to the AFDC eligibility of their parents or 
                legal guardians, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Foster Care to 21 Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that each additional year in extended foster 
care has--
            (1) significantly increased the probability that youth 
        completed a high school credential by approximately 8 percent;
            (2) increased their expected probability of enrolling in 
        college by between 10 percent and 11 percent;
            (3) increased the number of quarters that youth have been 
        employed between their 18th and 21st birthdays;
            (4) increased the amount of money youth have had in bank 
        accounts by an average of approximately $404;
            (5) increased the odds that youth have described a 
        professional as a source of social support;
            (6) significantly decreased the amount of money youth have 
        received in need-based public food assistance by an average of 
        more than $700;
            (7) decreased the odds of having experienced an additional 
        economic hardship between the ages of 17 and 21 by 
        approximately 12 percent;
            (8) decreased the odds of being homeless or couch-surfing 
        between the ages of 17 and 21 by approximately 28 percent;
            (9) decreased the odds that youth have become pregnant or 
        impregnated a female between the ages of 17 and 21 by 
        approximately 28 percent; and
            (10) decreased the odds that youth have been arrested 
        between the ages of 17 and 21 by approximately 41 percent and 
        decreased the odds that youth have been convicted of a crime 
        during the same period by approximately 40 percent.

the meaning of the applicable provisions of section 475(8), then, 
notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations 
promulgated under section 1123A(b)(3), the Secretary shall assess a 
penalty against the State in an amount equal to not less than 1 percent 
and not more than 5 percent of the amount of the total amount otherwise

this subsection with respect to any noncompliance covered by a

                voluntarily re-enter foster care; and

legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is required in 
order for a State plan developed pursuant to part E of title IV of the 
Social Security Act to meet the additional requirements imposed by the 
amendments made by this Act, the plan shall not be regarded as failing 
to meet any of the additional requirements before the 1st day of the 
1st calendar quarter beginning after the first regular session of the 
State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
Act. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the State has a 2-year

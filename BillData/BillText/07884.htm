SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that the Benton MacKaye Trail--
            (1) is a scenic, nonmotorized trail that traverses 
        approximately 287 miles over some of the most renowned forests 
        and mountains in the States of Georgia, Tennessee, and North 
        Carolina;
            (2) showcases a wide variety of scenic views, including 
        high elevation peaks, mature forests, and secluded waterfalls, 
        and passes through wilderness rich with biodiversity;
            (3) passes through six designated Wilderness Areas, the 
        Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the Chattahoochee, 
        Cherokee, and Nantahala National Forests;
            (4) provides a wide array of easily accessible hikes for 
        novice and intermediate hikers, as well as more challenging 
        trails for backpacking and end-to-end thru hikes;
            (5) supports economic opportunities for numerous rural 
        communities that benefit from the trail's visitors spending 
        their money on accommodations, food, and outdoor supplies;
            (6) runs from Springer Mountain in Georgia, through 
        Tennessee, and extends through the Great Smoky Mountains 
        National Park in North Carolina; and
            (7) is physically accessible and can be maintained at a 
        minimal cost because--

                located on Federal public land; and

                constructed, maintained, and managed by the Benton

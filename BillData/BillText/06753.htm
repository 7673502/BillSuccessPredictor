                                 A BILL


 
     To provide enhanced authority for the President to enter into 
  agreements with the Government of Ukraine to lend or lease defense 
articles to that Government to protect civilian populations in Ukraine 
        from Russian military invasion, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. REAFFIRMATION OF POLICY.

    Congress reaffirms--
            (1) its finding under section 501 of the Foreign Assistance 
        Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2301) that ``the efforts of the United 
        States and other friendly countries to promote peace and 
        security continue to require measures of support based upon the 
        principle of effective self-help and mutual aid'';
            (2) its recognition under that section that ``the peace of 
        the world and the security of the United States are endangered 
        so long as hostile countries continue by threat of military 
        action, by the use of economic pressure, and by internal 
        subversion, or other means to attempt to bring under their 
        domination peoples now free and independent and continue to 
        deny the rights of freedom and self-government to peoples and 
        countries once free but now subject to such domination''; and
            (3) its intention under that section ``to promote the peace 
        of the world and the foreign policy, security, and general 
        welfare of the United States by fostering an improved climate 
        of political independence and individual liberty, [and] 
        improving the ability of friendly countries and international 
        organizations to deter or, if necessary, defeat aggression''.

 To direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to revise HIPAA 
      regulations to ensure patient access to telehealth services.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. REVISION OF HIPAA REGULATIONS TO ENSURE PATIENT ACCESS TO 
              TELEHEALTH SERVICES.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in 
this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall revise the HIPAA 
privacy regulation (as defined in section 1180(b)(3) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320d-9(b)(3))) to ensure that, with respect to 
services furnished by a health care provider via telehealth during the 
7-year period beginning on the last day of the emergency period 
described in section 1135(g)(1)(B) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b-
5(g)(1)(B)), such provider may so furnish such services using any non-
public facing audio or video communication product (as such term is 
used for purposes of the notice entitled ``Notification of Enforcement 
Discretion for Telehealth Remote Communications During the COVID-19 
Nationwide Public Health Emergency'' as published by the Office of 
Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services).
    (b) Extension of Policy.--The Secretary may extend the 7-year 
period described in subsection (a) for such duration as determined 
appropriate by the Secretary if the Secretary finds, after a review of 
telehealth services furnished during such period, that such extension 
is appropriate.

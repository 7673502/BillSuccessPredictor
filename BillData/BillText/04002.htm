which the student is in attendance except that--
            ``(A) any period during which the student is enrolled in a 
        noncredit or remedial course of study as defined in paragraph 
        (2) shall not be counted for the purpose of this paragraph; and
            ``(B) the period during which a student may receive Federal 
        Pell Grants shall also include the period required for the 
        completion of the first postbaccalaureate course of study in a 
        case in which--
                    ``(i) the student received a Federal Pell Grant 
                during the period required for the completion of the 
                student's first undergraduate baccalaureate course of 
                study for at least 1 but fewer than 12 semesters, or 
                the equivalent of at least 1 but fewer than 12 
                semesters, as determined under paragraph (5);
                    ``(ii) the student would otherwise be eligible for 
                a Federal Pell Grant, but for the completion of such 
                baccalaureate course of study; and
                    ``(iii) the period during which the student 
                receives Federal Pell Grants does not exceed the 
                student's duration limits under paragraph (5).''.

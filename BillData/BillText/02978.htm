                                 A BILL


 
  To require a report regarding the scope of efforts by the People's 
 Republic of China and Chinese Communist Party to utilize the Belt and 
Road Initiative to undermine the United States-led international world 
     order and a detailed strategy regarding how the United States 
 Government intends to counter such Initiative, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Build Responsible Infrastructure 
Development for the Global Economy Act'' or the ``BRIDGE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Chinese government's Belt and Road Initiative 
        (BRI), enshrined in the CCP's constitution, is a comprehensive, 
        long-term economic development strategy founded by General 
        Secretary and President Xi Jinping to link regions worldwide 
        through multi-billion infrastructure projects. The CCP utilizes 
        the BRI's informal framework as a vehicle to establish a 
        Sinocentric world order based on its authoritarian model of 
        governance.
            (2) The BRI poses immediate and long-term risks to the 
        national security, economic security, and international 
        influence of the United States and our partners by giving the 
        PRC the ability to project power more widely in geostrategic 
        regions such as the Indo-Pacific. The BRI, covering countries 
        representing over half of the world's population and over one-
        third of global economic output, seeks to pull nations into 
        Beijing's geopolitical orbit.
            (3) Despite the BRI's well-documented scope and 
        consequences, the United States government has never formalized 
        an official view or strategy to counter its efforts. This puts 
        our national security objectives at a severe disadvantage as 
        Beijing seeks to leverage its regional inroads worldwide 
        through the BRI and other PRC-alternative institutions to 
        achieve global preeminence.
            (4) The United States should not underestimate the 
        significance of the BRI and establish a coherent, government-
        wide strategy that effectively seeks to counter Beijing's 
        economic and political scope and influence through the BRI.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to counter efforts by the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) 
to create an integrated economic and political order under its 
leadership, which continues to threaten the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United States
     (a) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in coordination

        (CCP) to utilize the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to 
        undermine the United States-led international world order.
            (2) Information relating to the means and objectives of the 
        PRC and the CCP in using the BRI as a vehicle to create a 
        parallel order of alternative PRC-centric organizations.
            (3) An assessment of current United States Government tools 
        and strategies to counter the BRI.

                    (B) An assessment of past efforts by the United 
                States Government to mitigate the effects of BRI, as 
                well as the gaps in current United States Government

SEC. 2. MASKS REQUIRED IN FEDERAL FACILITIES.

    (a) Masks Required.--Each Federal agency shall take action to 
ensure that an individual is required to wear a face mask if such 
individual is--
            (1) inside a Federal facility under the jurisdiction of 
        such agency; and
            (2) within 6 feet of another individual.

individual who fails to wear a mask in accordance with subsection (a).
    (c) Provision of Masks.--Each Federal agency shall make face masks 
available at each entrance to a Federal facility at which such agency 
maintains a presence.
    (d) Funding.--A Federal agency shall use funds otherwise 
appropriated to such agency to carry out this section.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Capitol buildings.--The term ``Capitol Buildings'' has 
        the meaning given such term in section 5101 of title 40, United 
        States Code.
            (2) Face mask.--The term ``face mask'' means a mask 
        covering both the nose and mouth that reasonably can be 
        expected to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

                    (B) the Capitol Buildings or any part thereof.
    (f) Termination.--The requirements of this section shall cease to 
have effect on the date on which the Director of the National Institute

requirement to wear a mask is no longer necessary to prevent 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

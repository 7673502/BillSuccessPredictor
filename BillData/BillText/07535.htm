                                 An Act


 
To encourage the migration of Federal Government information technology 
   systems to quantum-resistant cryptography, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Quantum Computing Cybersecurity 
Preparedness Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) Cryptography is essential for the national security of the 
    United States and the functioning of the economy of the United 
    States.
        (2) The most widespread encryption protocols today rely on 
    computational limits of classical computers to provide 
    cybersecurity.
        (3) Quantum computers might one day have the ability to push 
    computational boundaries, allowing us to solve problems that have 
    been intractable thus far, such as integer factorization, which is 
    important for encryption.
        (4) The rapid progress of quantum computing suggests the 
    potential for adversaries of the United States to steal sensitive 
    encrypted data today using classical computers, and wait until 
    sufficiently powerful quantum systems are available to decrypt it.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) a strategy for the migration of information technology of 
    the Federal Government to post-quantum cryptography is needed; and
        (2) the governmentwide and industrywide approach to post-
    quantum cryptography should prioritize developing applications, 
    hardware intellectual property, and software that can be easily 
    updated to support cryptographic agility.

    technology to post-quantum cryptography, which shall include at a 
    minimum--
            (A) a requirement for each agency to establish and maintain 
        a current inventory of information technology in use by the 
        agency that is vulnerable to decryption by quantum computers, 
        prioritized using the criteria described in subparagraph (B);
            (B) criteria to allow agencies to prioritize their 
        inventory efforts; and
            (C) a description of the information required to be 
        reported pursuant to subsection (b).

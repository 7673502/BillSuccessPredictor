                                 A BILL


 
     To amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
 Assistance Act with respect to hazard mitigation plans, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Climate Risk and Emergency Support 
In Livable Inclusive and Equitable Neighborhoods and Communities 
Everywhere Act'' or the ``Climate RESILIENCE Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the 2018 National Climate Assessment, 
        climate change due to global warming has caused, and is 
        expected to continue to cause, substantial interference with 
        and growing losses to human health and safety, infrastructure, 
        property, industry, recreation, natural resources, agricultural 
        systems, and quality of life in the United States.
            (2) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration, climate change is already increasing the 
        frequency and severity of extreme weather and other climate-
        related disasters, including drought, wildfire, and storms that 
        include precipitation.
            (3) According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
        Administration, in 2020, there were a record 22 weather and 
        climate disasters costing $1,000,000,000 or more across the 
        country, shattering the prior annual record of 16. These events 
        totaled $95,000,000,000 in damages.
            (4) Since 2015, the United States has experienced more than 
        81 individual disasters, amounting to $630,200,000,000 in 
        economic losses, and close to 4,000 deaths.
            (5) Researchers have found that Black, Latino, and low-
        income families are more likely to live in high-risk areas like 
        flood zones, less likely to have money to harden infrastructure 
        and homes in advance of disasters, and less likely to receive 
        assistance during recovery periods.
            (6) According to Dr. Beverly Wright and Dr. Robert Bullard, 
        ``environmental and public health threats from natural and 
        human-made disasters are not randomly distributed, affecting 
        some communities more than others'', and therefore our response 
        to disasters necessitates the adoption of policies and 
        processes rooted in principles of racial equity, self-
        determination, and democracy.
            (7) Research from the University of Colorado shows that the 
        top 10 percent of disaster hotspots account for about 30 
        percent of the contiguous United States but are home to nearly 
        60 percent of buildings in the country.
            (8) According to testimony in November 2017 from former 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long, 
        ``I cannot overstate the importance of focusing on investing in 
        mitigation before a disaster strikes. Building more resilient 
        communities is the best way to reduce risks to people, 
        property, and taxpayer dollars.''.
            (9) The Government Accountability Office found that the 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency spends 88 percent of its 
        budget on postdisaster mitigation.
            (10) For fiscal year 2020 grant application cycle, the 
        Federal Emergency Management Agency received nearly 
        $4,000,000,000 in applications for their grant programs. 
        However, in fiscal year 2020, the Federal Emergency Management 
        Agency only made $700,000,000 available for predisaster 
        mitigation.
            (11) Public-sector investment in mitigation since 1995 by 
        the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Housing and 
        Urban Development Agency cost the country $27,000,000,000 but 
        is projected to save $160,000,000,000, totaling $6 saved per $1 
        invested.
            (12) The United States has an opportunity to use disaster 
        mitigation to minimize risk, improve resiliency, and address 
        social problems.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    Section 102 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (2) by inserting ``extreme temperature 
        event, including heat wave or freeze,'' after ``snowstorm'';

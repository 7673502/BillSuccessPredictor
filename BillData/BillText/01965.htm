 To award three congressional gold medals to the United States Capitol 
             Police and those who protect the U.S. Capitol.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States Capitol Police (``Capitol Police'') 
        are essential to the protection of the U.S. Capitol, and each 
        person who works in or visits the complex depends on them for 
        their safety.
            (2) In their dedication to provide this essential safety to 
        the U.S. Capitol, numerous Capitol Police and other law 
        enforcement have even paid with their lives while in the line 
        of duty.
            (3) Those who have paid with their lives in the line of 
        duty include Sergeant Christopher S. Eney in 1984; Officer 
        Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson in 1998; and 
        Sergeant Clinton J. Holtz in 2014.
            (4) Most recently, we mourn the losses of Capitol Police 
        Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, and Metropolitan 
        Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, who all passed in 
        January 2021.
            (5) The sacrifices made by each of these men are never 
        forgotten in the U.S. Congress and by the many individuals who 
        benefit from their service.
            (6) The service and sacrifices of the Capitol Police should 
        be recognized and honored.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.

manner.

            (2) the law of the State provides that expungement or

        General, containing such information as the Attorney General 
        may require, including, at a minimum--

                system that, as of the date of the application, exists 
                for record expungement or record sealing in the State;
                    (B) a description of how infrastructure created 
                through grant funding will facilitate automatic 
                expungement or record sealing funding for individuals 
                eligible for record sealing or expungement; and
                    (C) an identification of the anticipated number of 
                individuals that would benefit from the implementation

            (1) Not more than 10 percent of such grant shall be used

        infrastructure improvements that will make criminal record 
        expungement or sealing automatic.
            (2) Any remaining amounts shall be used to implement such 
        improvements.
            (3) The portion of the costs of implementing such a law

        percent.

        expunged or sealed annually since the enactment of such law,

shall develop and report a comprehensive plan to obtain as much of the 
unavailable data as possible not later than the date that is one year 
after the first year of the grant being awarded.
    (c) Publication.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, and each year thereafter, the Attorney General shall 
publish, and make available to the public, a report containing the data

                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of State to provide to Congress a briefing and 
 report on the support of the People's Republic of China for Russia's 
              invasion of Ukraine, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Direct Investigations on China, Take 
Action To Oppose Russia Act of 2022'' or the ``DICTATOR Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China (in this section 
        referred to as the ``PRC'') and the Russian Federation have, in 
        recent years, forged a closer relationship, based largely on 
        their shared interest in challenging the rules-based 
        international order, in an attempt to reshape that order into 
        one that is more welcoming to their authoritarian systems of 
        government.
            (2) On February 4, 2022, the PRC and Russian Federation 
        issued a Joint Statement on the International Relations 
        Entering a New Era and the Global Sustainable Development, 
        which stated that ``friendship between the two States has no 
        limits'' and that ``there are no forbidden areas of 
        cooperation''.
            (3) In their Joint Statement, the PRC and the Russian 
        Federation reaffirmed support for state sovereignty and 
        territorial integrity and called on all countries to protect 
        international law.
            (4) Per media reporting, leading up to Russia's unprovoked 
        invasion of Ukraine, United States officials held multiple 
        meetings with PRC officials presenting intelligence showing 
        Russian troop buildup around Ukraine and requested Chinese 
        assistance in urging the Russian Federation not to attack 
        Ukraine.
            (5) A March 2, 2022, New York Times article reported that 
        senior Chinese officials told senior Russian officials in early 
        February 2022 not to invade Ukraine before the end of the 
        Winter Olympics in Beijing.
            (6) The New York Times reported that PRC officials later 
        shared United States intelligence with Russia and stated that 
        the United States ``was trying to sow discord and that China 
        would not try to impede Russian plans and actions''.
            (7) On February 21, 2022, President Vladimir Putin of the 
        Russian Federation declared unilateral recognition of the 
        Donetsk and Luhansk separatist regions of Ukraine and ordered 
        Russian troops to enter those regions in a further invasion of 
        Ukraine to carry out ``peacekeeping functions''.
            (8) On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched an 
        unprovoked large-scale further invasion of Ukraine with the 
        goal of taking over major cities, including the capital city of 
        Kyiv, by military force.
            (9) The PRC's Foreign Ministry spokesperson refused to 
        categorize Russia's attacks as an ``invasion'' and referred 
        repeatedly to the Russian Federation's statements on Ukraine.
            (10) On February 24, 2022, the PRC announced it would lift 
        restrictions on wheat imports from Russia to ease the impact of 
        sanctions on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
            (11) Russian forces are reported to have targeted civilian 
        population centers and launched attacks without regard for 
        civilian casualties, some of which may constitute war crimes.
            (12) On March 2, 2022, the Chief Prosecutor of the 
        International Criminal Court announced an investigation into 
        possible war crimes committed in Ukraine after a referral by 39 
        member states.
            (13) On March 2, 2022, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi 
        recognized the conflict in Ukraine as a ``war'' and expressed 
        that China was ``extremely concerned'' about the harm to 
        civilians in Ukraine.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Government and entities associated with People's 
        Republic of China who assist the Russian Federation or Russian 
        oligarchs in evading sanctions imposed following the Russian 
        invasion of Ukraine are, in so doing, supporting the Russian 
        Federation's unprovoked attack on Ukraine and the Ukrainian 
        people, including alleged war crimes committed by Russian Armed 
        Forces against unarmed civilians; and
            (2) the President should impose sanctions on those entities 
        found to have aided the Russian Federation or Russian oligarchs 
        in evading sanctions imposed by the United States and allied 
        nations following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require a section on 
   reproductive rights in the Annual Country Reports on Human Rights 
                   Practices, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reproductive Rights are Human Rights 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States has joined the international 
        community in identifying reproductive rights as human rights, 
        including in connection with the 1994 International Conference 
        on Population and Development, the 1995 Beijing World 
        Conference on Women, and through its ratification of the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, done at 
        New York December 19, 1966 (referred to in this Act as 
        ``ICCPR''), the International Convention on the Elimination of 
        All Forms of Racial Discrimination, done at New York December 
        21, 1965, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, 
        Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, done at New York 
        December 10, 1984.
            (2) General comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the 
        ICCPR, which was adopted by the Human Rights Committee on 
        October 30, 2018, asserts that States parties--
                    (A) should ensure access for all persons to 
                ``quality and evidence-based information and education 
                about sexual and reproductive health and to a wide 
                range of affordable contraceptive methods'';
                    (B) ``must provide safe, legal, and effective 
                access to abortion where the life and health of the 
                pregnant woman or girl is at risk, or where carrying a 
                pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or 
                girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where 
                pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not 
                viable'';
                    (C) ``ensure the availability of, and effective 
                access to, quality prenatal and post-abortion health 
                care for women and girls''; and
                    (D) must not impose restrictions on the ability of 
                women or girls to seek abortion in a manner that 
                jeopardizes their lives, subjects them to physical or 
                mental pain or suffering, discriminates against them, 
                arbitrarily interferes with their privacy, or places 
                them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions.
            (3) Reproductive coercion, which is any behavior that 
        interferes with autonomous decision making about reproductive 
        health outcomes, is a violation of human rights.
            (4) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 
        intersex persons (LGBTQI+) face stigma and discrimination in 
        accessing reproductive health services, and barriers, including 
        anti-LGBTQI+ laws, policies, and gender norms in countries. The 
        denial of access to sexual and reproductive health care and 
        associated human rights violations due to these barriers should 
        be reported in relevant Department of State Annual Country 
        Reports on Human Rights Practices.
            (5) Human rights are grounded in international standards. 
        The Department of State's deletion of the reproductive rights 
        subsection from its 2017, 2018, and 2019 Country Reports on 
        Human Rights Practices inappropriately politicized human rights 
        of people around the world.
            (6) Limiting reproductive rights also limits pathways to 
        economic, social, and political empowerment. Sexual and 
        reproductive health and rights are essential for sustainable 
        economic development, are intrinsically linked to gender 
        equality and women's well-being, and are critical to community 
        health.
            (7) The global COVID-19 pandemic has placed at risk the 
        fulfillment of reproductive rights. The United Nations Office 
        of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has raised concerns 
        that overloaded health systems, shortages of medical supplies, 
        and disruptions of global supply chains have undermined the 
        sexual and reproductive health and rights of individuals.

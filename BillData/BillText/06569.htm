                   TITLE I--FINDINGS AND DEFINITIONS

SEC. 101. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States economy has changed rapidly as 
        automation, artificial intelligence, digital technologies, and 
        modern information and communication systems have transformed 
        the way people in the United States work, live, and interact.
            (2) The United States must establish policies and create 
        programs capable of responding to changing economic realities.
            (3) The United States must develop strategies to maximize 
        current assets and help grow a United States economy and 
        workforce that can thrive in a challenging environment of 
        constant change and reinvention.
            (4) The Nation needs to strengthen and improve Federal 
        support for a Next Generation economy and workforce.
            (5) The United States must explore sustainable strategies 
        to create jobs that will endure, will remain reliant on a local 
        workforce, and are unlikely to move overseas.
            (6) There is great value and untapped potential in the 
        Nation's rich history, the creative freedoms enjoyed by its 
        people, and the many cultures and traditions that make the 
        United States so unique.
            (7) Promoting local arts and enhancing the creative economy 
        of the United States would support the Nation's diverse 
        citizenry, rich traditions, and vast creative talents, 
        including the unique history and continuing vitality of Native 
        American communities.
            (8) The United States must embrace the opportunities and 
        challenges the country faces and reimagine the role of the 
        Federal Government in providing support for local arts activity 
        and expanding the creative economy.
            (9) The United States needs to engage workers from around 
        the Nation to develop, hone, and share expressions of their 
        cultural heritage, including languages, creative 
        collaborations, and artistic skills.
            (10) The Nation needs to recognize that there is a broad 
        range of undervalued and underutilized human potential in the 
        United States, and the existence of that human potential has 
        profound social, economic, and workforce ramifications.
            (11) Securing the future well-being of individuals, 
        families, communities, and the Nation will depend in part on 
        adopting Federal policies that will increase support for the 
        creative economy.
            (12) The Nation needs to improve creative workforce 
        readiness and develop an education and job training plan, 
        including a plan for education and training through specialized 
        vocational schools and apprenticeship programs, to ensure that 
        individuals of all ages in the United States can realize their 
        full creative potential now and in the future.
            (13) Investing in a creative economy workforce would help 
        showcase the Nation's creative arts, strengthen its capacity 
        for job growth, promote economic inclusion, boost 
        entrepreneurship, improve and revitalize rural, remote, and 
        underserved areas, and empower communities to share their 
        stories.

                                 AN ACT


 
   To require the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a 
 consumer product safety rule for free-standing clothing storage units 
  to protect children from tip-over related death or injury, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Tip-overs of Unstable, Risky 
Dressers on Youth Act'' or the ``STURDY Act''.

SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD TO PROTECT AGAINST TIP-OVER OF 
              CLOTHING STORAGE UNITS.

    (a) Clothing Storage Unit Defined.--In this section, the term 
``clothing storage unit'' means any free-standing furniture item 
manufactured in the United States or imported for use in the United 
States that is intended for the storage of clothing, typical of bedroom 
furniture.
    (b) Consumer Product Safety Standard Required.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (c)(1), 
        not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, the Consumer Product Safety Commission shall--
                    (A) in consultation with representatives of 
                consumer groups, clothing storage unit manufacturers, 
                craft or handmade furniture manufacturers, and 
                independent child product engineers and experts, 
                examine and assess the effectiveness of any voluntary 
                consumer product safety standards for clothing storage 
                units; and
                    (B) in accordance with section 553 of title 5, 
                United States Code, promulgate a final consumer product 
                safety standard for clothing storage units to protect 
                children from tip-over-related death or injury that 
                includes--
                            (i) tests that simulate the weight of 
                        children up to 60 pounds;
                            (ii) objective, repeatable, and measurable 
                        tests that simulate real world use and account 
                        for any impact on clothing storage unit 
                        stability that may result from placement on 
                        carpeted surfaces, drawers with items in them, 
                        multiple open drawers, or dynamic force;
                            (iii) testing of all clothing storage 
                        units, including those under 30 inches in 
                        height; and
                            (iv) warning requirements based on ASTM 
                        F2057-17, or its successor at the time of 
                        enactment, provided that the Consumer Product 
                        Safety Commission shall strengthen the 
                        requirements of ASTM F2057-17, or its 
                        successor, if reasonably necessary to protect 
                        children from tip-over-related death or injury.
            (2) Treatment of standard.--A consumer product safety 
        standard promulgated under paragraph (1) shall be treated as a 
        consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the 
        Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).
    (c) Subsequent Rulemaking.--
            (1) In general.--At any time subsequent to the publication 
        of a consumer product safety standard under subsection (b)(1), 
        the Commission may initiate a rulemaking, in accordance with 
        section 553 of title 5, United States Code, to modify the 
        requirements of the consumer product safety standard described 
        in subsection (b)(1) if reasonably necessary to protect 
        children from tip-over-related death or injury.
            (2) Revision of rule.--If, after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        revises its Clinical Growth Charts, the consumer product safety 
        standard described in subsection (b)(1) shall, on the date that 
        is 180 days after such revision, be revised to include tests 
        that simulate the weight of children up to the 95th percentile 
        weight of children 72 months in age, as depicted in the revised 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Clinical Growth 
        Charts, unless the Commission determines the modification is 
        not reasonably necessary to protect children from tip-over-
        related death or injury.
            (3) Treatment of rules.--Any rule promulgated under 
        paragraph (1) or revision made pursuant to paragraph (2) shall 
        be treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under 
        section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).

            Passed the House of Representatives June 23, 2021.

            Attest:

                                             CHERYL L. JOHNSON,

                                                                 Clerk.

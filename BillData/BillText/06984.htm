                                 A BILL


 
To authorize humanitarian assistance to the people of Ukraine, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Humanitarian Support Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Vladimir Putin has repeatedly threatened and violated 
        the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Russia's 
        neighbors, including Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine to 
        quash democratic movements in those countries and strengthen 
        his own power.
            (2) In 2014, Russia invaded and has since occupied regions 
        of Ukraine, including areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, 
        after the Ukrainian people ousted, a corrupt and repressive 
        President Viktor Yanukovych and expressed their clear desire to 
        deepen their integration with the European Union.
            (3) On February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation, led by 
        Vladimir Putin, drastically escalated his invasion in Ukraine, 
        resulting in a full-scale invasion by the Russian Armed Forces 
        and causing massive displacement in the country and region that 
        threatens to trigger a wider humanitarian crisis in Europe.
            (4) Vladimir Putin's decision to escalate his invasion of 
        Ukraine is being met with stiff Ukrainian resistance and 
        transatlantic and international resolve to support Ukraine and 
        hold Russia accountable.
            (5) The United States and its allies and partners around 
        the globe provided every opportunity for a diplomatic 
        resolution to this crisis to avoid unnecessary death and 
        suffering.
            (6) Putin's aggression in Ukraine threatens universal 
        democratic ideals and transatlantic security.
            (7) According to Human Rights Watch and international 
        monitors, the Russian Armed Forces have committed grave 
        violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, 
        including violations against children's rights, the use of 
        explosive weapons including cluster munitions in populated 
        areas, and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, homes, and non-
        military infrastructure.
            (8) Adherence to the Geneva Conventions and their 
        Additional Protocols is essential to ensure humanitarian access 
        and life-saving assistance can be maintained for civilian 
        populations despite conflict.
            (9) As part of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the 
        Russian Armed Forces, Vladimir Putin and Belarusian Alyaksandar 
        Lukashenka have further cracked down domestically, including 
        mass arrests, on any dissent on Russians and Belarusians who 
        voice opposition to this war.
            (10) The invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Armed Forces 
        threatens Belarusian and Russian dissidents living in Ukraine 
        as well as ethnic and LGBTQI+ minorities and other vulnerable 
        groups.
            (11) Ukrainians have displayed immense bravery, courage, 
        and resolve in standing up to protect democratic values and 
        their sovereignty and resist illegal and unprovoked aggression 
        from the Russian Armed Forces led by Putin.
            (12) The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
        Armed Forces threatens to create a dire humanitarian crisis in 
        Europe with secondary and tertiary impacts across the globe.
            (13) According to a rapid humanitarian needs assessment by 
        the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian 
        Affairs, in the next three months the conflict is projected to 
        drive humanitarian needs for nearly 12 million people living in 
        Ukraine at the time of the escalation, including a projected 
        6.7 million internally displaced persons within Ukraine, and as 
        many as 4 million people in Ukraine projected to flee to 
        neighboring countries for safety.
            (14) Prior to full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
        Armed Forces, around 1.4 million people had been internally 
        displaced inside Ukraine since Russia's invasion in 2014, and 
        potentially millions more will be displaced in Ukraine already 
        in dire need of assistance and survivors of eight years of 
        violence and insecurity.
            (15) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian 
        Armed Forces beginning in February of 2022 displaced roughly 
        1.5 million people living in Ukraine within the first two 
        weeks, with millions more expected to flee or be internally 
        displaced.
            (16) Ukraine's neighbors (Moldova, Poland, Slovakia, 
        Hungary, and Romania) have welcomed and provided immediate and 
        unconditional support close to two million Ukrainian refugees.
            (17) Humanitarian efforts will be required across sectors 
        to address the needs of refugees and internally displaced 
        persons from Ukraine will require including shelter, 
        protection, nutrition and food security, emergency 
        telecommunications, logistics, education, as well as water, 
        sanitation and hygiene.
            (18) Humanitarian assistance efforts should take into 
        account the gender, age, disability makeup of refugees and 
        others in need of humanitarian assistance to ensure adequate 
        supplies of appropriate assistance including protection needs 
        and services.
            (19) Humanitarian assistance should take into account the 
        provision of mental health and psycho-social support to crisis 
        affected populations with specific provisions for the needs of 
        children.
            (20) In addition, the needs of the immediate humanitarian 
        crisis, the further invasion and destruction of Ukraine by 
        Russian Armed Forces will have secondary and tertiary effects 
        for ongoing humanitarian crises around the world, including 
        exacerbating food insecurity and disrupting global agricultural 
        markets given Ukraine's historical wheat production.
            (21) Ukraine is a primary source of grain and corn exports 
        for the Middle East and Africa, which are already grappling 
        with hunger issues, food shortages, and price increases.
            (22) The further invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Armed 
        Forces will prevent farmers from fertilizing and replanting 
        their crops, which will affect output of production in the next 
        harvest cycle, lower their total exports, and create further 
        implication for global food security in the years to come.
            (23) Many families who have fled Ukraine have lost their 
        homes and their livelihoods and, thus, although emerging survey 
        data suggest the majority would like to return home, it is more 
        likely that many will have to stay in third countries for an 
        extended time as the situation in Ukraine stabilizes and 
        critical infrastructure, communities, and homes are rebuilt.
            (24) The majority of these refugees are women and children, 
        and the children will need access to language courses, 
        education, and educational services while seeking refuge in a 
        third country.
            (25) On March 3, 2022, the Biden Administration, with the 
        strong support of Congress, extended Temporary Protected Status 
        for thousands of Ukrainians in the United States.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

        persons to areas not in or under Russian control and secure 
        humanitarian space and principled humanitarian action within

        children;
            (8) ensure funding can be used to support critical 
        training, capacity, and direction activities for robust civil

        potential violations of international human rights perpetrated 
        against crisis-affected children and other civilians as a 
        result of the conflict in Ukraine, and ensure resourcing and

        perpetrators of grave violations against children and other 
        persons accountable;
            (9) leverage international partnerships and United States

        Ukraine;
            (10) support allies and partners, such host countries in 
        the region, including Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and 
        Poland, in building with humanitarian assistance support and 
        capacity for asylum processing, refugee reception, and 
        assistance programs;
            (11) work with Ukrainian authorities, United Nations 
        entities, the European Union and European allies, implementing 
        partners, and others to ensure unimpeded access and delivery of 
        humanitarian assistance within Ukraine;
            (12) ensure all humanitarian assistance remains flexible to 
        meet the needs of the evolving humanitarian situation in

        are able to access necessary legal assistance and essential 
        services;
            (14) support efforts to provide primary, secondary, and

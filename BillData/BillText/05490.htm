                                 A BILL


 
    To amend the Defense Production Act of 1950 to prevent harm and 
  disruption to the United States agriculture industry by protecting 
   against foreign influence over agriculture production and supply 
                    chains, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Adversary Risk Management 
Act'' or the ``FARM Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) United States agriculture and supply chains are 
        critical to United States economic success and prosperity, and 
        should each be classified as critical infrastructure and 
        critical technologies.
            (2) Agriculture is the lifeblood that helps to feed United 
        States families nationwide. As such, food security is a matter 
        of national security and should be a top priority of the United 
        States.
            (3) To prevent harm to the United States public health 
        sector and to prevent disruption to the United States economy 
        and food supply chains, the increasing influence foreign 
        countries may have on the United States agriculture industry 
        and agriculture supply chains should be mitigated.

              INVESTMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide an additional 
 deduction for the cost of certain materials purchased directly from a 
                     domestic smelter or processor.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Manufacturing America's Mineral 
Security Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) It is in America's best interest to ensure a robust and 
        secure domestic supply chain for U.S. manufacturers.
            (2) The United States increasing reliance on foreign 
        sources of metals and minerals threatens our economic and 
        national security while providing our geopolitical rivals, such 
        as China and Russia, leverage over our economy.
            (3) Incentivizing domestic mineral and metal production and 
        the purchase of these materials will make our Nation's supply 
        chains more secure and resilient.

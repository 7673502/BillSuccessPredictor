    (a) In General.--Section 227(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 
(47 U.S.C. 227(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Recovery by state attorneys general of forfeiture 
        penalties for violations with intent.--
                    ``(A) Civil action.--In any case in which a State 
                attorney general has reason to believe that an interest 
                of the residents of such State has been adversely 
                affected by a violation described in paragraph (4)(B) 
                for which the Commission has determined a forfeiture 
                penalty under such paragraph, the State attorney 
                general may bring a civil action on behalf of the 
                residents of such State exclusively in a district court 
                of the United States of appropriate jurisdiction to 
                recover any unpaid amount of such forfeiture penalty.
                    ``(B) Deposit of funds in treasury; retention of 
                costs.--

                        Treasury of the United States for the sole 
                        purpose of deficit reduction.

                        who recovers any funds in a civil action under 
                        subparagraph (A) may retain an amount of such 
                        funds equal to the amount of costs incurred by 
                        the State attorney general in bringing such 
                        action.

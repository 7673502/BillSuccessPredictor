Punished Based on COVID-19 Status.--At the election of a covered member 
and upon application through a process established by the Secretary of

                    ``(B) the discharge status of the member would have

                obtain such vaccine;
            ``(2) reinstate the member at the grade held by the member 
        immediately prior to the involuntary separation of the member;

        retired or retainer pay of the member.
    ``(d) Attempt To Avoid Discharge.--The Secretary of Defense shall--
            ``(1) make every effort to retain members of the Armed 
        Forces who are not vaccinated against COVID-19;
            ``(2) create an exemption to the requirement that members 
        of the Armed Forces be vaccinated against COVID-19 for such 
        members with natural immunity; and
            ``(3) recognize an exemption to the requirement that 
        members of the Armed Forces be vaccinated against COVID-19 
        based on an underlying health condition or the sincerely held 
        religious beliefs of an individual member.

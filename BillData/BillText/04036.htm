                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the SUPPORT for 
   Patients and Communities Act to provide for Medicare and Medicaid 
       mental and behavioral health treatment through telehealth.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Enhance Access to Support Essential 
Behavioral Health Services Act'' or the ``EASE Behavioral Health 
Services Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Nearly 18 percent of adults in the United States 
        reported a mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder in 2015.
            (2) Children are also significantly impacted. According to 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 6 children 
        ages 2 years through 8 years have a diagnosed mental, 
        behavioral, or developmental disorder, indicating that 
        disorders begin in early childhood and affect lifelong health.
            (3) Moreover, 1 in 7 children and adolescents have at least 
        one treatable mental health disorder.
            (4) There is a critical link between mental health and 
        substance use disorders. According to the Substance Abuse and 
        Mental Health Services Administration, 1 in 4 adults with 
        severe mental illness had a substance use disorder in 2017.
            (5) Moreover, children who have had a major depressive 
        episode are more than twice as likely to use illicit drugs.
            (6) In 2017, approximately 19.7 million people aged 12 
        years or older had a substance use disorder related to their 
        use of alcohol or illicit drugs in the past year.
            (7) Despite this overwhelming need, access to behavioral 
        health services remains among the most pressing health care 
        challenges in our country.
            (8) An estimated 56 percent of Americans with a mental 
        health disorder did not receive treatment in 2017.
            (9) Similarly, half of children and adolescents did not 
        receive treatment for their mental health disorder in 2016.
            (10) Further complicating access to care, as demand for 
        behavioral health services increases in communities across the 
        United States, the number of psychiatrists available to treat 
        them continues to decline.
            (11) The population of practicing psychiatrists declined by 
        more than 10 percent between the period of 2003 through 2013, 
        while the population of primary care physicians and 
        neurologists grew during the same period.
            (12) Technology has evolved to connect individuals to 
        health care services in new ways, including via telehealth.
            (13) Moreover, studies show that video visits are an 
        effective strategy to provide mental health treatment to 
        children and, in fact, may be preferable in some cases.
            (14) During the 115th Congress, Congress recognized the 
        potential of telehealth to ensure that those in urgent need of 
        substance use disorder treatment receive the care they require.
            (15) As passed and signed into law, sections 2001 and 1009 
        of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (Public Law 
        115-271) expands the use of telehealth services for the 
        treatment of opioid use disorder and other substance use 
        disorders.
            (16) It is widely recognized that there is a close 
        relationship between mental health and substance use disorders.

SEC. 3. MEDICARE TREATMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FURNISHED 
              THROUGH TELEHEALTH.

        paragraph (4)(C)(i) shall not apply with respect to telehealth 
        services that are behavioral health services furnished on or

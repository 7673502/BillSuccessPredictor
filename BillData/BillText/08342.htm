  To require the development of recommendations to improve and fully 
  implement the Military Interstate Children's Compact, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Military Interstate Children's 
Compact Commission Improvement Act''.

SEC. 2. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE MILITARY INTERSTATE 
              CHILDREN'S COMPACT.

    (a) Recommendations Required.--The Secretaries concerned, in 
consultation with States through the Defense-State Liaison Office, 
shall develop recommendations to improve and fully implement the 
Military Interstate Children's Compact.
    (b) Considerations.--In carrying out subsection (a), the 
Secretaries concerned shall--
            (1) identify any barriers--
                    (A) to the ability of a parent of a transferring 
                military-connected child to enroll the child, in 
                advance, in an elementary or secondary school in the 
                State in which the child is transferring, without 
                requiring the parent or child to be physically present 
                in the State; and
                    (B) to the ability of a transferring military-
                connected child who receives special education services 
                to gain access to such services and related supports in 
                the State to which the child transfers within the 
                timeframes required under the Individuals with 
                Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);
            (2) consider the feasibility and advisability of--
                    (A) tracking and reporting the number of families 
                who use advanced enrollment in States that offer 
                advanced enrollment to military-connected children;
                    (B) States clarifying in legislation that 
                eligibility for advanced enrollment requires only 
                written evidence of a permanent change of station 
                order, and does not require a parent of a military-
                connected child to produce a rental agreement or 
                mortgage statement; and
                    (C) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with 
                the Military Interstate Children's Compact, developing 
                a letter or other memorandum that military families may 
                present to local educational agencies that outlines the 
                protections afforded to military-connected children by 
                the Military Interstate Children's Compact; and
            (3) identify any other actions that may be taken by the 
        States (acting together or separately) to improve the Military 
        Interstate Children's Compact.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretaries concerned shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees and to the States a report setting

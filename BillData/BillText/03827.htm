                objectively reasonable belief violates the terms of 
                service or use of the provider or user, as applicable.
            ``(2) Civil liability.--No provider or user of an 
        interactive computer service shall be held liable on account 
        of--

                is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively 
                violent, promoting terrorism or violent extremism, 
                harassing, promoting self-harm, or unlawful, whether or

        another person or entity.
            ``(4) Good faith.--In addition to the other applicable 
        requirements, in order for a provider or user to avoid 
        liability under paragraph (1)(C) or (2)(A), such provider or 
        user shall meet the following requirements, if applicable:
                    ``(A) Makes publicly available terms of service or

                content-moderation practices of the service.
                    ``(B) Restricts access to or availability of 
                material consistent with those terms of service or use 
                and with any official representations or disclosures

                material that is similarly situated to material that 
                the service intentionally declines to restrict.
                    ``(D) Supplies the provider of the material with 
                timely notice describing with particularity the

                        the material relates to terrorism or other 
                        criminal activity; or
                            ``(iii) such notice would risk imminent

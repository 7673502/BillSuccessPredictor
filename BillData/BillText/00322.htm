                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Help 
 America Vote Act of 2002 to promote integrity in voter registration, 
the casting of ballots, and the tabulation of ballots in elections for 
                Federal office, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Save Democracy 
Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress recognizes that the legitimacy of the United 
        States representative democracy rests on the integrity of our 
        Federal elections and confidence our citizens have in them.
            (2) Consistent with article I, section 4, clause 1 of the 
        Constitution of the United States and the principles of 
        federalism, primary authority to regulate Federal elections is 
        reserved to the States, while Congress's role is secondary.
            (3) While exercising its primary role in determining the 
        manner in which Federal elections shall be carried out, States 
        must seek to protect the fairness, accessibility, and integrity 
        of the elections.
            (4) Congress should limit its secondary role in regulating 
        Federal elections to instances in which State regulation of 
        Federal elections has contributed to or proven unsuccessful in 
        preventing impropriety.

        office in the State, if eligible, by electronically 
        transferring the information necessary for registration from

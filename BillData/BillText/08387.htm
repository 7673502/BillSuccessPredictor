SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Parity for Tribal Law Enforcement

SEC. 2. TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

    The Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act (25 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.) is 
amended by inserting after section 4 the following:

``SEC. 4A. TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

    ``(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law, law 
enforcement officers of any Indian Tribe that has contracted or 
compacted any or all Federal law enforcement functions through the 
Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 
et seq.) shall have the authority to enforce Federal law within the 
area under the Tribe's jurisdiction, if--
            ``(1) the Tribal officers involved have--
                    ``(A) completed training that is comparable to that 
                of an employee of the Office of Justice Services of the 
                Bureau of Indian Affairs who is providing the same 
                services in Indian country, as determined by the 
                Director of the Office of Justice Services of the 
                Bureau of Indian Affairs or the Director's designee;
                    ``(B) passed an adjudicated background 
                investigation equivalent to that of an employee of the 
                Office of Justice Services of the Bureau of Indian 
                Affairs who is providing the same services in Indian 
                country; and
                    ``(C) received a certification from the Office of 
                Justice Services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as 
                described in subsection (c); and
            ``(2) the Tribe has adopted policies and procedures that 
        meet or exceed those of the Office of Justice Services of the 
        Bureau of Indian Affairs for the same program, service, 
        function, or activity.
    ``(b) While acting under the authority granted by the Secretary 
through an Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 
U.S.C. 5301 et seq.) contract or compact, a Tribal law enforcement 
officer shall be deemed to be a Federal law enforcement officer for the 
purposes of--
            ``(1) sections 111 and 1114 of title 18, United States 
        Code;
            ``(2) consideration as an eligible officer under subchapter 
        III of chapter 81 of title 5, United States Code;
            ``(3) subchapter III of chapter 83 and subchapter III of 
        chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code; and
            ``(4) chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code (commonly 
        known as the `Federal Tort Claims Act').
    ``(c)(1) Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of 
this section, the Secretary shall--
            ``(A) develop procedures for the credentialing of Tribal 
        officers under this section, independent of section 5, to 
        provide confirmation that Tribal officers meet minimum 
        certification standards and training requirements for Indian 
        country peace officers, as prescribed by the Secretary; and
            ``(B) promulgate guidance, in consultation with Indian 
        Tribes, to otherwise implement the provisions of this section.
    ``(2) Tribal law enforcement officers who choose to attend a State 
or other equivalent training program approved by the Director of the 
Office of Justice Services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the 
Director's designee, rather than attend the Indian Police Academy, 
shall be required to attend the IPA Bridge Program, or an equivalent 
program, prior to receiving a certification under this subsection.''.

SEC. 3. OVERSIGHT, COORDINATION, AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

    The Attorney General, acting through the Deputy Attorney General, 
shall coordinate and provide oversight for all Department of Justice 
activities, responsibilities, functions, and programs to ensure a 
coordinated approach for public safety in Indian communities, 
accountability, and compliance with Federal law, including--
            (1) the timely submission of reports to Congress;
            (2) robust training, as required under Federal law and as 
        needed or requested by Indian Tribes or Federal and State 
        officials relating to--
                    (A) public safety in Indian communities; and
                    (B) training outcomes demonstrating a better 
                understanding of public safety approaches in Indian 
                communities;
            (3) the updating and improvements to United States attorney 
        operational plans;
            (4) comprehensive evaluation and analysis of data, 
        including approaches to collecting better data, relating to 
        public safety in Indian communities; and
            (5) other duties or responsibilities as needed to improve 
        public safety in Indian communities.

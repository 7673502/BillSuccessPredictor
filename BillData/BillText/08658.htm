        residents of the United States from price shocks and 
        profiteering; and
            (2) as one such tool, the Federal Government should build 
        the capacity to establish limits on the growth of certain 
        prices, and to otherwise strategically regulate such prices, in

        update such list (based on changing economic conditions) not 
        later than once every 6 months.
            (3) Analyze how the prices described in paragraph (1) are 
        impacted by disruptions to supply chains, including those 
        related to the COVID-19 pandemic and similar threats to public 
        health, climate-driven disasters and extreme weather events,

        large corporations, that exercise disproportionate pricing 
        power over the prices described in paragraph (1).
            (5) Determine when any such economically significant entity 
        has acted to raise or maintain a price described in paragraph 
        (1)--
                    (A) to exceed corresponding increases in per-unit 
                input and labor costs, or despite such costs that are 
                falling; or
                    (B) to an extent that is not economically 
                necessary, including when such cost increases could 
                reasonably be absorbed in whole or in part by the 
                economically significant entity.
            (6) Inform the President and Congress, in a prompt manner 
        that is made available to the public on an appropriate website, 
        if the increases described in paragraph (5) are widespread or 
        burdensome such that action by the Federal Government is 
        warranted to protect residents of the United States and the 
        economy of the United States, including when such increases are 
        related to inflation.
            (7) Make actionable recommendations, including

                            (ii) reduce volatility and promote 
                        stability of such prices.
                    (B) Any other concurrent or subsequent action as 
                the Sub-Task Force determines appropriate to ensure 
                successful and equitable implementation of such 
                targeted price controls and regulations, including 
                action to do the following:
                            (i) Make adjustments to any enacted

                        supply of impacted goods and services,

                            (iii) Promote the expansion of relevant

                        stockpiles and reserves.
                            (iv) Ensure and verify that such targeted 
                        price controls and regulations do not lead to 
                        an increase in (and wherever possible reduce) 
                        greenhouse gas emissions or any other negative 
                        impacts on public health, the environment, and

                        to the supply chains of such firms, or that

                        Act, including requirements to pass on lower 
                        costs to consumers, contribute to sufficient 
                        production and supply of goods and services, 
                        and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other 
                        negative impacts on public health, the 
                        environment, and local communities.
                            (vi) Establish price floors as appropriate,

        into account any other tool the Federal Government is 
        authorized to use to directly prevent or counteract price-
        gouging, windfall profits, or other harmful practices under the 
        purview of the Sub-Task Force, such that the recommendations of 
        the Sub-Task Force will complement, work in tandem with, or

        acting mechanisms where necessary to achieve the goals of this 
        Act.

following:
            (1) How the Federal Government, State governments, and 
        other public regulatory bodies already regulate certain prices,

        prices directly in the past.

                prices of goods and services, corporate profits, price-
                setting and investment decisions, supply chains, and 
                other relevant indicators and practices;
                    (B) the maximization of democratic participation by 
                the agency or entity carrying out such price 
                management; and
                    (C) methods of enforcement.
            (4) Other policies and investments the Federal Government 
        should prioritize, in conjunction with price management, to 
        ease inflationary pressures and enhance the health, safety, 
        economic security, and well-being of residents of the United 
        States, including investments in sustainable agriculture and 
        food systems, renewable energy and efficiency, domestic

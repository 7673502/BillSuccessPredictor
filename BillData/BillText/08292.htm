SECTION 1. REPORT ON PUERTO RICO'S ELECTRIC GRID.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the 
Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in 
consultation with the Secretary of the Department of Energy and the 
Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, shall 
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on Puerto 
Rico's progress toward rebuilding the electric grid and that details 
the efforts the Federal Government is undertaking to expedite such 
rebuilding. The report shall contain the following:
            (1) An analysis of the state of Puerto Rico's electric 
        grid, including the following:
                    (A) A list of projects in order of priority, 
                estimated cost, and estimated time necessary for 
                completion.
                    (B) An analysis of the measures taken by the 
                Federal Government to expedite such rebuilding and the 
                effectiveness of such measures.
                    (C) Information relating to the amount of funds 
                that have been allocated and the amount of funds that 
                have been disbursed.
                    (D) An analysis of how the Federal Government can 
                provide further assistance in expediting such 
                rebuilding.
            (2) An analysis of the state of Puerto Rico's renewable 
        energy generation and storage capacities, including the 
        following:
                    (A) A list of current and expected projects focused 
                on renewable energy generation and storage.
                    (B) A report on the development of renewable energy 
                sources in Puerto Rico, including projections for 
                meeting renewable energy metrics established in the 
                Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act (Act 17).
                    (C) An analysis of challenges for improving Puerto 
                Rico's renewable energy capacity and recommendations 
                for addressing such challenges.
                    (D) An analysis of how the Federal Government can 
                provide further assistance, including funding and 
                legislative actions, in facilitating renewable energy 
                development and improving Puerto Rico's renewable 
                energy generation and storage capacities.
                    (E) An analysis of the extent to which FEMA funding 
                to rebuild the electric grid will be used to support 
                the construction of, or to extend the operating life 
                of, fossil fuel generation, and the extent to which 
                those assets will become stranded assets as the cost of 
                renewable energy continues to decrease.
            (3) Recommendations, as appropriate, for power companies 
        and governments to reduce the number of outages and blackouts.
            (4) Proposals, as appropriate, for legislative actions and 
        funding needed to improve the process of fund disbursement for 
        critical projects related to electric grids.
            (5) A plan for expediting such rebuilding by not later than 
        three months after the report is so submitted.
    (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``appropriate 
congressional committees'' means the Committee on Homeland Security, 
the Committee on Natural Resources, and the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Energy 
and Natural Resources of the Senate.

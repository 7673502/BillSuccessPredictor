about restrictions regarding the carrying of firearms in sterile areas

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Air Travel Act''.

SEC. 2. SIGNAGE.

    Section 44901 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(m) Signage Regarding Firearms.--
            ``(1) Checkpoint signage.--Not later than one year after 
        the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Administrator 
        of the Transportation Security Administration shall display 
        uniform signage in passenger screening checkpoints to inform 
        individuals at such checkpoints of restrictions regarding the 
        carrying of a firearm in the sterile area of an airport. Such 
        signage shall include visual elements and a concise description 
        of the maximum criminal and civil penalties (with relevant 
        statutory or regulatory citations) for unlawfully carrying a 
        firearm in the sterile area of an airport.
            ``(2) Placement.--Signage under paragraph (1) shall be 
        prominently displayed and located in such a manner that it 
        would reasonably be expected to be seen by an individual prior 
        to entering the passenger screening checkpoint.
            ``(3) Airports with frequent firearm interdictions.--Not 
        later than one year after the date of the enactment of this 
        subsection and biennially thereafter, the Administrator of the 
        Transportation Security Administration shall publish a list of 
        not fewer than 25 airports at which firearms were most 
        frequently interdicted at passenger screening checkpoints in 
        the prior two years. If with respect to any such list there are 
        fewer than 25 such airports, such list shall include as many of 
        such airports as are otherwise described in this paragraph.
            ``(4) Additional enhanced signage for airports with 
        frequent firearm interdictions.--Not later than 180 days after 
        the date of the publication of each list required under 
        paragraph (3), the Administrator of the Transportation Security 
        Administration shall require each airport included on the list 
        to install additional enhanced signage at all passenger 
        terminal entrances to such airports to inform the public and 
        individuals planning to enter a passenger screening checkpoint 
        of the restrictions regarding the carrying of a firearm in the 
        sterile area of the airport and, as applicable, State, local, 
        territorial, or other jurisdiction-specific restrictions on 
        carrying firearms in the publicly-accessible areas of the 
        airport. Such additional enhanced signage shall be consistent 
        for all airports required to install such additional enhanced 
        signage under this paragraph, except, as the case may be, for 
        descriptions of such applicable State, local, territorial, or 
        other jurisdiction-specific restrictions. The Administrator may 
        permit an airport to remove such signage if such airport is not 
        included on a subsequent list.
            ``(5) Outdated signage.--If any relevant information on 
        signage installed pursuant to this subsection is rendered 
        inaccurate due to statutory, regulatory, or other changes, the 
        Administrator shall ensure such signage is updated in a timely 
        manner, except this paragraph does not apply in the case of 
        annual inflation adjustments to civil monetary penalties.
            ``(6) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    ``(A) Passenger screening checkpoint.--The term 
                `passenger screening checkpoint' means the designated 
                area at each airport located in the United States at 
                which the Transportation Security Administration, or an 
                entity authorized by the Administration pursuant to 
                section 44920, or other comparable authority, provides 
                for the screening of passengers and carry-on baggage.
                    ``(B) Passenger terminal entrance.--The term 
                `passenger terminal entrance' means the area at each 
                airport located in the United States where individuals 
                arriving to the airport by means other than a flight 
                first enter the terminal or other comparable enclosure 
                containing passenger facilities of the airport located 
                prior to the passenger screening checkpoint.
                    ``(C) Sterile area.--The term `sterile area' has

and deployment of passenger screening checkpoint technology.
    ``(h) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be 
interpreted as--
            ``(1) limiting the authority of the Administrator of the 
        Transportation Security Administration to issue civil monetary 
        penalty amounts that are greater than those established as 
        minimum civil monetary penalty amounts pursuant to this 
        section;
            ``(2) limiting the authority of the Administrator to 
        establish minimum civil monetary penalty amounts with respect 
        to first-time or non-egregious violations of section 1540.111

        civil monetary penalty amount with respect to violations 
        involving unloaded replicas of firearms not capable of 
        discharge.
    ``(i) Definition.--In this section, the term `passenger screening

in Restricted Areas.--
            ``(1) In general.--Any unauthorized individual who 
        possesses a firearm after the individual is present for 
        screening at a passenger screening checkpoint shall be 
        ineligible for expedited security screening and prohibited from 
        participating in the PreCheck Program for a period of time 
        determined by the Administrator of the Transportation Security

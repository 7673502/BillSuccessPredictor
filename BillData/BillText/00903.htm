3(c)(1)(F)--
            (1) shall not be subject to any reduction in either the 
        rate of adjusted basic pay payable or law enforcement 
        availability pay payable to such covered employee; and
            (2) shall be credited for years of service in a specific 
        pay band under a TSA personnel management system as if the 
        employee had served in an equivalent General Schedule position 
        at the same grade, for purposes of determining the appropriate 
        step within a grade at which to establish the employee's 
        converted rate of pay.
    (b) Retirement Pay.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a proposal, including proposed legislative 
changes if needed, for determining a covered employee's average pay for 
purposes of calculating the employee's retirement annuity, consistent 
with title 5, United States Code, for any covered employee who retires 
within three years of the conversion date, in a manner that 
appropriately accounts for time in service and annual rate of basic pay 
following the conversion date.
    (c) Limitation on Premium Pay.--Notwithstanding section 5547 of 
title 5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, a Federal 
Air Marshal or criminal investigator hired prior to the date of

    ``(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Federal Air 
Marshal who is an employee of the Transportation Security

rate and in such a manner, so that such Federal Air Marshal does not 
receive less overtime pay than such Federal Air Marshal would receive 
were that Federal Air Marshal subject to the overtime pay provisions of 
section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.''.
            (3) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraphs (1) 
        and (2) shall begin to apply on the conversion date (as that 
        term is defined in section 2 of the Rights for the TSA 
        Workforce Act of 2022).
    (e) Collective Bargaining Unit.--Notwithstanding section 7112 of

out screening functions under section 44901 of title 49, United States 
Code, shall remain eligible to form a collective bargaining unit.
    (f) Preservation of Other Rights.--The Secretary shall take any 
actions necessary to ensure that the following rights are preserved and 
available for each covered employee as of the conversion date and any

        on accumulated leave under chapter 63 of title 5, United States 
        Code.
            (2) Part-time personnel carrying out screening functions 
        under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code, pay 
        Federal Employees Health Benefits premiums on the same basis as 
        full-time TSA employees.
            (3) Covered employees are provided appropriate leave during 
        national emergencies to assist the covered employees and ensure 
        TSA meets mission requirements, notwithstanding section 6329a 
        of title 5, United States Code.
            (4) Eligible covered employees carrying out screening 
        functions under section 44901 of title 49, United States Code, 
        receive a split-shift differential for regularly scheduled

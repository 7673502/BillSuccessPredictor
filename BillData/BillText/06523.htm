                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants 
   to a local educational agency or private elementary or secondary 
   school, partnered with a public or nonprofit private health care 
  entity, to develop and implement a comprehensive program to promote 
 student access to defibrillation in elementary schools and secondary 
                                schools.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Access to AEDs Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.

    The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the 
        United States.
            (2) Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a life-threatening 
        emergency that is caused by a malfunction in the heart's 
        electrical system or structure, which is caused by an 
        abnormality from birth or one that develops over time.
            (3) Studies show that 1 in 300 youth has an undetected 
        heart condition that puts them at risk.
            (4) SCA is the leading cause of death for student athletes.
            (5) Sports-related SCA accounted for 39 percent of SCAs 
        among children 18 years old or younger.
            (6) In 2018, there were nearly 394,000 sudden cardiac 
        arrests that occurred in the United States, with 9 out of 10 
        being fatal. Only 1 in 10 victims survive a sudden cardiac 
        arrest.
            (7) An estimated 7,000 to 23,000 young people are stricken 
        by SCA annually.
            (8) The American Heart Association estimates that 5 in 10 
        victims of SCA could survive if bystanders gave CPR and used an 
        AED immediately.
            (9) The chain of survival includes prompt notification of 
        emergency services and early CPR, defibrillation, and advanced 
        cardiac life support.
            (10) Health education should include basic emergency 
        lifesaving skills. Incorporating these lifesaving training 
        programs into the health curriculum of elementary and secondary 
        schools will give school children these skills.

                                 A BILL


 
To enable high research activity status historically Black colleges or 
 universities to increase capacity toward achieving very high research 
                activity status, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``HBCU Research, Innovation, Security, 
and Excellence Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Historically Black colleges and universities hold a 
        unique position in the efforts of the United States to 
        diversify the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics 
        academic and workforce communities.
            (2) Although our Nation's historically Black colleges and 
        universities make up just 3 percent of the colleges and 
        universities in the United States, historically Black colleges 
        and universities graduate 25 percent of African-American 
        students with baccalaureate degrees in the fields of science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics.
            (3) Historically Black colleges and universities are the 
        institution of origin for almost 30 percent of Black graduates 
        of science and engineering doctorate programs.
            (4) The health of the Department of Defense and the United 
        States research ecosystem relies on high quality researchers 
        from a diverse talent pool.
            (5) Historically Black colleges and universities have a 
        history of conducting high quality research in unique areas, 
        both providing impactful research outcomes and developing the 
        next generation of the research ecosystem, including by--
                    (A) conducting high quality research in unique 
                areas that has enriched the Department of Defense 
                research enterprise and the United States research 
                ecosystem, including--
                            (i) providing science and engineering 
                        faculty research opportunities at U.S. Navy 
                        Laboratories;
                            (ii) a ``Young Investigators Program'' at 
                        the Air Force Research Laboratory supporting 
                        basic and applied research on aerospace systems 
                        (RQ), materials and manufacturing (RX), and 
                        information (RI); and
                            (iii) Centers of Excellence in 
                        biotechnology and materials science; and
                    (B) strengthening and diversifying the United 
                States research ecosystem by increasing the number of 
                students who are students of diverse backgrounds from 
                historically Black colleges and universities with 
                undergraduate or graduate degrees in science, 
                technology, engineering, or mathematics; and
                    (C) fueling domestic and international 
                collaborations that led to trailblazing discoveries and 
                innovative technologies.
            (6) In 2019, historically Black colleges and universities 
        received $371,000,000, or about 0.8 percent of the 
        $44,500,000,000 in Federal funding to institutions of higher 
        education for research and development. The amount of funding 
        for 2019 is a marked decrease from fiscal year 2018, when 
        historically Black colleges and universities received 
        $400,000,000 in Federal research and development funding (0.9 
        percent of the Federal funding to institutions of higher 
        education for such purposes).
            (7) There are no historically Black colleges and 
        universities designated as very high research activity status, 
        as classified by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of 
        Higher Education.
            (8) Meaningfully investing in the research capacity of 
        historically Black colleges and universities is an investment 
        in our Nation's future and will help meet accelerating science, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce demands and 
        safeguard the national security interests of the United States.

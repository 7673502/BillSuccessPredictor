SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) During a decade of civil rights reforms, Congress 
        passed title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
        2000d et seq.) (referred to in this section as ``title VI''), 
        which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or 
        national origin in federally funded programs and activities; 
        title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
        seq.) (referred to in this section as ``title IX''), which 
        prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education 
        programs and activities; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 
        of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) (referred to in this section as 
        ``section 504''), which prohibits discrimination based on 
        disability in federally funded programs and activities; and the 
        Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (42 U.S.C. 6101 et seq.), which 
        prohibits discrimination based on age in federally funded 
        programs and activities. Half a century after their passage, 
        still more needs to be done to ensure that students enjoy 
        protections consistent with the spirit, intent, and promise of 
        these groundbreaking civil rights laws.
            (2) Schools are still failing to take necessary steps to 
        prevent harassment on the basis of sex, race, national origin, 
        color, and disability and provide survivors of sexual assault 
        and other forms of harassment--especially women and girls, 
        students of color, LGBTQI+ students, and students with 
        disabilities--the support and services they need to feel safe 
        and learn in school, denying them equal educational 
        opportunities.
            (3) As the Supreme Court has held in Franklin v. Gwinnett 
        County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60 (1992), and Davis v. Monroe 
        County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), covered 
        entities are responsible for preventing and addressing 
        harassment on the basis of sex in their education programs and 
        activities under title IX. Following this principle, courts 
        have similarly required funding recipients to address 
        harassment based on race, color, national origin, and 
        disability in their education programs and activities.
            (4) Perpetrators of harassment based on sex, race, color, 
        national origin, or disability at school are not limited to 
        students, nor are the victims of such harassment. Incidents 
        have also involved faculty, administrators, coaches, 
        volunteers, other staff members, and visitors.
            (5) Sexual harassment of students, especially of women and 
        girls, students of color, students with disabilities, and 
        LGBTQI+ students, is widely prevalent in K-12 and higher 
        education. For example--
                    (A) 1 in 5 girls ages 14 through 18 have been 
                kissed or touched without their consent, 58 percent of 
                LGBTQI+ youth ages 13 through 21 have been sexually 
                harassed, and disabled children are 2.9 times more 
                likely than their peers to be sexually assaulted;
                    (B) women and girls of color are more likely to 
                experience sexual harassment in school than their White 
                peers; and
                    (C) in college--
                            (i) more than 1 in 4 women, more than 1 in 
                        15 men, and nearly 1 in 4 transgender, 
                        nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming students 
                        are sexually assaulted during their time as 
                        undergraduates;
                            (ii) 1 in 7 women, 1 in 10 men, and 1 in 5 
                        transgender, nonbinary, and gender-
                        nonconforming students experience dating 
                        violence or domestic violence as 
                        undergraduates; and
                            (iii) 1 in 10 women, 1 in 33 men, and 1 in 
                        7 transgender, nonbinary, and gender-
                        nonconforming students experience stalking as 
                        undergraduates.
            (6) Students also experience forms of sex-based harassment 
        beyond sexual harassment, such as harassment based on sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics (including 
        intersex status), pregnancy, childbirth, medical conditions 
        related to pregnancy or childbirth, and sex stereotypes.
                    (A) For example, according to one study, 86.3 
                percent of LGBTQI+ students experienced harassment or 
                assault based on personal characteristics, 77.6 percent 
                reported avoiding school functions, and 71.8 percent 
                reported avoiding extracurricular activities because 
                they felt unsafe or uncomfortable.
                    (B) According to another study, 64 percent of girls 
                who were pregnant or parenting reported not feeling 
                safe at school as a barrier to attending school 
                compared to 32 percent of girls overall.
            (7) Like sex-based harassment, harassment based on race, 
        color, national origin, and disability remains a problem at 
        educational institutions.
                    (A) Between 2011 and 2016, the National Center for 
                Education Statistics documented a 40-percent increase 
                in college campus hate incidents. According to the 
                Bureau of Justice Statistics, racial bias is the most 
                common motivation behind these hate incidents.
                    (B) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
                has agreed that racism has a profound and negative 
                impact on the mental and physical health of people of 
                color. As such, racist incidents can take a serious 
                toll on students' overall health and well-being, even 
                affecting their academic performance. A 2021 UCLA study 
                found that young adults who experience discrimination 
                are at higher risk for both short and long-term 
                behavioral and mental health problems that are 
                exacerbated with each incident.
                    (C) According to the Department of Justice, the 
                rate of violence victimization against persons with 
                disabilities is nearly 4 times the rate for nondisabled 
                persons. Nearly \1/3\ of children and adolescents with 
                disabilities have experienced violence. Corporal 
                punishment is almost twice as high in schools with a 
                higher proportion of students with disabilities 
                receiving special education services as in other 
                schools. Girls with disabilities are also at higher 
                risk of sexual violence perpetrated by their peers than 
                nondisabled girls.
            (8) The Government Accountability Office estimated that 
        about 1 in 4 students aged 12-18 saw hate words or symbols 
        written at schools in 2014-2015, 2016-2017, and 2018-2019.
            (9) Students also often experience intersectional forms of 
        harassment that, for example, may include sexual harassment 
        that is racialized or harassment based on having a disability 
        and being transgender, among other types of intersectional 
        harassment.
            (10) Few students report harassment to their schools, often 
        because of shame or self-blame, fear of retaliation, fear of 
        being ignored or disciplined, fear of police or immigration 
        officials, or lack of knowledge of services schools can offer 
        to help. In particular, women and girls of color, women and 
        girls with disabilities, pregnant and parenting students, and 
        LGBTQI+ students are too often disbelieved and met with 
        unsupportive responses, including retaliation, after reporting 
        sexual harassment because of stereotypes that label them as 
        less credible. Men and boys, too, are often disbelieved or 
        dismissed when they report sexual harassment.
            (11) Failure of a school to comply with title IX, title VI, 
        and section 504 may limit or deny the ability of students, 
        employees, and others to participate in or benefit from the 
        school's education programs or activities leading to 
        discrimination by creating a hostile learning environment that 
        impedes educational attainment, damages rights to equal 
        educational opportunities, and undermines learning for all.
            (12) When schools fail to protect student victims of 
        harassment, including by failing to offer supportive measures 
        that are designed to preserve and restore the educational 
        opportunities of the victim, students often suffer in the form 
        of emotional distress, mental health consequences, lower 
        academic achievement, lost scholarships and financial aid, poor 
        school attendance, and decreased school completion rates. 
        Moreover, many schools may respond negatively to harassment by 
        creating additional trauma and harm for the student victim 
        (often by, for example, blaming the student for their 
        victimization or by refusing to help them), which is also known 
        as ``institutional betrayal''. Harm may also be caused by the 
        Title IX coordinators having a conflict of interest, such as 
        serving within school leadership or local educational agency 
        leadership (including serving as a principal, vice principal, 
        headmaster, superintendent, board member, general counsel, 
        athletics director, coach, or dean of students, or on a 
        judicial hearing board or in a position to whom an appeal might 
        be made).
            (13) The language of title IX is broad and sweeping, making 
        clear that the intent of Congress is to provide avenues of 
        redress for opening the courthouse doors to victims of a wide 
        range of sex discrimination in schools. However, since the 
        passage of title IX, courts have created barriers that make it 
        extraordinarily difficult for survivors to obtain redress from 
        schools through private litigation.
            (14) In a 5 to 4 opinion in Gebser v. Lago Vista 
        Independent School District, 524 U.S. 274 (1998), the Supreme 
        Court held that students subjected to sex-based harassment by 
        their teachers may receive a damages remedy in private 
        litigation under title IX only when school officials with 
        ``authority to institute correct measures'' on the recipient's 
        behalf have ``actual notice'' of the harassment and are 
        ``deliberately indifferent'', or respond in a clearly 
        unreasonable manner, to it. A year later, in Davis v. Monroe 
        County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999), the Supreme 
        Court held that in order to receive money damages under title 
        IX, students who experience sex-based harassment by their 
        peers, must additionally show that the harassment is ``so 
        severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it can be 
        said to deprive the victims of access to the educational 
        opportunities or benefits provided by the school.'' Courts have 
        applied the same standards in requiring funding recipients to 
        address harassment based on race, color, national origin, or 
        disability.
            (15) In contrast, in the workplace, under title VII of the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.) (referred to 
        in this section as ``title VII''), a plaintiff experiencing 
        harassment based on sex, race, color, national origin, or 
        religion by a coworker or other non-supervisor need only show 
        their employer reacted negligently in response to severe or 
        pervasive harassment of which the employer knew or should have 
        known. And sometimes--such as when a supervisor fires someone 
        because they refuse to submit to sexual advances--title VII 
        automatically holds an employer liable.
            (16) Although they do not affect the relevant standards for 
        individuals to obtain injunctive and equitable relief for 
        harassment on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, 
        age, or disability under covered programs and activities, the 
        Supreme Court's decisions in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent 
        School District and Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education 
        and lower court opinions severely limit the availability of 
        remedies for such individuals by imposing more stringent 
        standards for recovery of damages. Yet in many cases, damages 
        are the only remedy that would effectively rectify past 
        harassment. Further, in 2022, in Cummings v. Premier Rehab 
        Keller PLLC, 142 S. Ct. 1562 (2022), the Supreme Court limited 
        the ability of plaintiffs bringing disability discrimination 
        claims under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
        (Public Law 111-148) and section 504 to recover emotional 
        distress damages, which are often the sole or primary remedy 
        for survivors of harassment. The dissenting Justices in 
        Cummings warned that this ruling upset Congressional intent and 
        longstanding precedent under these and other statues, 
        suggesting the possibility that its logic might be extended in 
        the future to other laws such as title IX and title VI. Some 
        lower courts have added additional onerous barriers, such as 
        one under which a school is liable for its failure to address 
        known sexual harassment only if the victim later experiences 
        further sexual harassment as a result of this failure.
            (17) These limitations thwart the purpose of Congress to 
        protect students from harassment and ensure non-discriminatory 
        educational environments. They create prohibitively high 
        standards for the lawsuits of students regarding harassment 
        based on sex, race, color, national origin, and disability 
        under title IX, title VI, and section 504 that are more onerous 
        than those applicable to workplace harassment lawsuits under 
        title VII. As a result, schools may do less to address 
        harassment against their students than to address the same 
        harassment of their employees. This means that students, who 
        are often children and young adults, must suffer worse 
        harassment than adult employees before they are entitled to a 
        remedy in court.
            (18) Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, 
        Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, and subsequent 
        opinions create an incentive for covered entities to insulate 
        themselves from knowledge of harassment rather than adopting 
        and enforcing practices that will minimize the danger of such 
        harassment. These opinions thus undermine the purpose of 
        prohibitions on discrimination in the civil rights laws, which 
        is to induce covered programs or activities to adopt and 
        enforce practices that will minimize the danger that vulnerable 
        students or other persons will be exposed to such odious 
        behavior.
            (19) Current title IX regulations issued by the Department 
        of Education in 2020 entitled ``Nondiscrimination on the Basis 
        of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal 
        Financial Assistance'' (part 106 of title 34, Code of Federal 
        Regulations), have made it more difficult for student survivors 
        to report harassment to schools and receive help, including by, 
        for example, only allowing schools to respond to title IX 
        complaints of sexual harassment that is so severe, pervasive, 
        and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person 
        equal access to a school program or activity--meaning students 
        will have to endure repeated and escalating levels of 
        harassment before their complaint can even be investigated. 
        These regulations also pose uniquely burdensome procedures for 
        cases of sexual harassment that are not required for any other 
        type of student or staff misconduct, further sweeping sexual 
        violence under the rug.
            (20) Department of Education guidance explains the 
        requirement under title VI and section 504 for institutions to 
        respond to harassment based on disability, race, color, or 
        national origin that is sufficiently serious to deny or limit 
        the ability of a student to participate in or benefit from the 
        education programs and activities of the recipient.
            (21) Schools with affirming and welcoming environments that 
        provide support and protection against all forms of harassment 
        and discrimination ensure that students have better social, 
        behavioral, academic, and mental health outcomes.
            (22) Legislative action is necessary and appropriate to 
        restore the access to the courts that was sharply limited by 
        Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, Davis v. 
        Monroe County Board of Education, Cummings v. Premier Rehab, 
        and other court opinions, restore the availability of a full 
        range of remedies for harassment based on sex, race, color, 
        national origin, disability, or age, and prevent discriminatory 
        harassment in schools. Any action needs to take into full 
        account the intersectionality of incidents of harassment in 
        educational programs or activities. Sex-based violence and 
        harassment often harms those populations already most 
        vulnerable at education institutions.
            (23) In landmark rulings in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins 490 
        U.S. 228 (1989) and Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. (2020), the 
        Supreme Court correctly interpreted title VII to hold that 
        discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sexual 
        orientation, or gender identity necessarily constitute 
        discrimination ``because of sex''. To date, Federal courts of 
        appeal have held uniformly that these holdings apply equally to 
        title IX. Legislative action is necessary and appropriate to 
        codify these established interpretations of title IX law and 
        ensure support and protection for LGBTQI+ students against 
        severe and widespread discriminatory harassment.
            (24) Discrimination by State and local governments on the 
        basis of sex, race, color, national origin, age, or disability 
        in education programs and activities receiving Federal 
        financial assistance violates the Equal Protection Clause of 
        the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In 
        many circumstances, such discrimination also violates other 
        constitutional rights such as those of liberty and privacy 
        under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. Congress 
        may validly invoke its powers under the 14th Amendment to 
        provide a full range of remedies in response to discrimination 
        by both private and government actors.
            (25) In enacting the protections of the amendments made by 
        this Act, Congress is acting pursuant to its authority under 
        section 5 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
        United States, the Commerce Clause of section 8 of article I of 
        the Constitution of the United States, and the Spending Clause 
        of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of the United 
        States.
            (26) Members of Congress have long been advocating for 
        substantive reforms that support student survivors and ensure 
        gender equity in schools, including the HALT on Campus Sexual 
        Violence Act, the Supporting Survivors of Sexual Harassment in 
        Schools Act of 2020, the Patsy T. Mink and Louise M. Slaughter 
        Gender Equity in Education Act, the Stop Sexual Harassment in 
        K-12 Act, and the Exposing Discrimination in Higher Education 
        Act. Provisions from these groundbreaking pieces of legislation 
        serve as the foundation on which any larger comprehensive 
        reform must be built.
            (27) Restoring the availability of a full range of remedies 
        for harassment will--
                    (A) ensure that students and other persons 
                participating or attempting to participate in federally 
                funded programs and activities have protection from 
                harassment on the basis of sex (including sexual 
                orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, 
                pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition related to 
                pregnancy or childbirth, and sex stereotypes), race, 
                color, national origin, disability, or age;
                    (B) encourage covered entities to adopt and enforce 
                meaningful policies and procedures to prevent and 
                remedy harassment;
                    (C) deter incidents of harassment; and
                    (D) provide appropriate remedies for harassment.
            (28) Schools do not harass students on the basis of race, 
        gender, or sex when they teach or incorporate anti-racism 
        principles, diversity, equity and inclusion practices, 
        culturally relevant curriculum and culturally responsive 
        teaching, critical race theory, or otherwise focus the 
        experiences of students of color, women and girls, and LGBTQI+ 
        students. Indeed, such teaching and training, when implemented 
        appropriately, may often further the purposes of the mandate of 
        title VI to prohibit discrimination based on race, color, and 
        national origin and the mandate of title IX to prohibit 
        discrimination based on sex, while also ensuring that schools 
        are advancing equity.

SEC. 101. AMENDMENTS TO TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1972.

    Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
seq.) is amended--

            ``(1) Harassment by agents, employees, and other persons 
        authorized by the recipient to provide aid, benefit, or

        liable if its agent, employee, or other person authorized by 
        the recipient to provide aid, benefit, or service under the 
        recipient's program or activity, engages in sex-based 
        harassment against a person who participates in or receives any 
        benefit, service, or opportunity from such program or activity, 
        or who attempts to receive such benefit, service, or 
        opportunity, regardless of where the harassment occurs, if--
                    ``(A) the harassment is enabled or assisted by the 
                authority exercised as an agent, employee, or other 
                authorized person of the recipient; or
                    ``(B) the recipient receives notice of the

        non-authorized persons.--Subject to subsection (e), a recipient 
        is liable for sex-based harassment if a person who is not its 
        agent, employee, or other authorized person, engages in sex-
        based harassment against a person who is participating in or 
        receiving any benefit, service, or opportunity from such 
        program or activity, or who is attempting to do so, regardless 
        of where the harassment occurs, if the recipient receives 
        notice of the harassment.
    ``(e) Affirmative Defense.--
            ``(1) In general.--A recipient is not liable in a private 
        action for damages under subsection (d) for sex-based 
        harassment, if the recipient demonstrates that it exercised 
        reasonable care to prevent sex-based harassment and to promptly 
        remedy the effects of the sex-based harassment at issue, 
        including through a demonstration by the recipient that it--
                    ``(A) established, adequately publicized, and 
                enforced an effective and comprehensive sex-based 
                harassment prevention policy, training, and complaint

                avoid harm without exposing the person subjected to 
                such harassment to undue risk, effort, or expense;

                such program or activity from a significant ongoing 
                threat of harm, undertook a prompt, thorough, and

                    ``(C) provided supportive measures that have the 
                purpose and effect of preserving and restoring a person 
                subjected to sex-based harassment's equal access to the 
                recipient's education program or activity, regardless 
                of whether such person requests an investigation; and
                    ``(D) took other necessary, immediate, and 
                appropriate corrective action designed to stop such

        harassment did not recur after the recipient received notice of 
        the harassment does not establish reasonable care absent the 
        demonstration required by subparagraphs (A) through (D) of 
        paragraph (1).
    ``(f) Notice.--A recipient receives notice of sex-based harassment 
if an agent, employee, or other authorized person of the recipient, or

        enrolled in the local educational agency complete the survey 
        tool developed pursuant to this section.
            (6) Personally identifiable information.--Information from 
        the survey tool shall not be disaggregated or reported if the

in collaboration with the Title IX Coordinator, institutions of higher 
education and local educational agencies shall issue guidance and 
disseminate guidance that explicitly address protections for students 
from punishment or retaliation when making reports of sexual 
harassment. Guidance shall be issued to all persons who participate in 
or receive any benefit, service, or opportunity from the issuing 
institution of higher education or local educational agency. Such 
guidance shall apply to all reports of harassment, including in the 
context of a same-gender relationship or encounter, and ensure that for 
all reports of sexual harassment--
            (1) the school will not take disciplinary action against 
        individuals, including witnesses, disclosing code-of-conduct 
        offenses that are related to the reported incident, including 
        the use of intoxicating substances occurring at or around the 
        time of a reported incident, reasonable actions taken to defend 
        against harassment, or actions taken to avoid contact with the 
        respondent;
            (2) if a school's code-of-conduct prohibits sexual activity 
        (or certain forms of sexual activity), the school will not take 
        disciplinary action against individuals disclosing in good 
        faith (including witnesses) non-harassing sexual activity 
        related to the reported incident, or for other non-harassing 
        sexual activity discovered during an investigation into the 
        reported incident;
            (3) the Title IX Coordinator shall review any disciplinary 
        actions related to a complaint of harassment to ensure that 
        such actions do not further discriminate or harass a 
        complainant (such as requiring therapy or participation in 
        programming focused on altering a student's sexual orientation 
        or gender identity);
            (4) a party who reports harassment shall not be disciplined 
        for a ``false report'' or for prohibited sexual conduct solely 
        because the school has decided there is insufficient evidence 
        for a finding of responsibility or because the respondent is 
        found not responsible; and
            (5) the school will address reports of retaliation against 
        complainants, which may include investigation or discipline for 
        retaliation.

                            (i) Requesting a waiver.--A local 
                        educational agency described in paragraph (1) 
                        may request a waiver from the Secretary of one 
                        or more of the requirements of such paragraph 
                        on the basis that the requirement poses an 
                        insurmountable financial burden to the agency

                            (ii) Alternative plan.--

                                alternative plan for ensuring that 
                                students are aware of their rights 
                                under title IX of the Education 
                                Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et 
                                seq.) and have access to a Title IX 
                                Coordinator.
                                    (II) Alternative plan.--An 
                                alternative plan submitted under 
                                subclause (I) shall include, at a 
                                minimum, a demonstration that the local 
                                educational agency has entered into a 
                                partnership with a local rape crisis 
                                center or a national or community-based 
                                organization that specializes in trauma 
                                or crisis management and support. Such 
                                a plan shall establish a clear 
                                delineation of the roles and 
                                responsibilities of the center or 
                                organization with the local educational

                                sex-based harassment.
                    (B) Withholding assistance.--If a local educational 
                agency has a waiver approved under this paragraph but 
                does not follow the alternative plan, or the Secretary 
                determines the plan was insufficient to prevent and 
                respond to sexual harassment and assault, the Secretary 
                shall attempt a voluntary resolution. If a voluntary 
                resolution is not possible during a reasonable period 
                of time, the Secretary shall take such action as may be 
                appropriate to withhold Federal financial assistance.
                    (C) Length of waiver.--A waiver granted under this 
                paragraph shall be valid for 2 years.

                agencies and institutions of higher education described 
                in paragraph (1) to offset the financial burden of 
                satisfying the requirements of this subsection. In 
                making grants under this paragraph, the Secretary shall 
                give priority to local educational agencies and 
                institutions of higher education that otherwise would 
                face a high financial burden in fulfilling such 
                requirements.
                    (B) Definition of institution of higher 
                education.--In this paragraph, the term ``institution 
                of higher education'' has the meaning given the term in 
                section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 
                U.S.C. 1001).
    (b) Training Requirements.--

                coordination with the Attorney General and in 
                consultation with national, State, or local victim 
                services organizations, local educational agencies, and

                training program, which may include online training 
                modules, for training each individual who is involved 
                in implementing student grievance procedures at an 
                institution of higher education or local educational 
                agency that receives Federal financial assistance from 
                the Department of Education, including each individual 
                who is responsible for resolving complaints of reported

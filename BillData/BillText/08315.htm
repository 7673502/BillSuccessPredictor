                of all such obligations for such industrial resource 
                shortfall to exceed $50,000,000, no such obligation may 
                be entered until the President provides a briefing to 
                Congress on the nature of the shortfall and the action 
                or actions necessary to mitigate the shortfall.''.

              BASE.

        source'' for purposes of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 
        U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) to ``domestic and allied source'' and 
        including business concerns in Canada, the United Kingdom, and 
        Australia in the definition of that term.
            (2) The benefits of facilitating more effective integration 
        of the national technology and industrial base with the 
        technology and industrial bases of countries that are allies or 
        partners of the United States with respect to technology 
        transfer, socioeconomic procurement requirements, and export 
        controls.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Congressional defense committees.--The term 
        ``congressional defense committees'' has the meaning given that 
        term in section 101(a) of title 10, United States Code.
            (2) National technology and industrial base.--The term 
        ``national technology and industrial base'' has the meaning 
        given that term in section 4801 of title 10, United States 
        Code.
            (3) Strategic and critical materials.--The term ``strategic 
        and critical materials'' has the meaning given that term in 
        section 12 of the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling 
        Act (50 U.S.C. 98h-3).

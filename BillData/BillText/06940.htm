                                 A BILL


 
 To impose additional prohibitions relating to foreign boycotts under 
     the Export Control Reform Act of 2018, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Israel Anti-Boycott Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Government of the United States should use its 
        voice, vote, and influence with and in international 
        governmental organizations to actively oppose politically 
        motivated actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel;
            (2) the Government of the United States combats anti-Israel 
        boycotts and other discriminatory activity under the Export 
        Control Reform Act of 2018 (subtitle B of title XVII of Public 
        Law 115-232), under part VI of title X of the Tax Reform Act of 
        1976 (Public Law 94-455; 90 Stat. 1649) (commonly referred to 
        as the ``Ribicoff Amendment''), through trade promotion 
        authorities, in free trade agreements, and in accession 
        negotiations to the World Trade Organization; however, due to 
        the increased anti-Israel economic activity in international 
        governmental organizations, it is necessary to update Federal 
        authorities to combat anti-Israel boycotts and other 
        discriminatory activity in such fora, including the United 
        Nations Human Rights Council;
            (3) actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel 
        represent a concerted effort to extract concessions from Israel 
        outside of direct negotiations between the Israelis and 
        Palestinians; and
            (4) the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 
        2014 (Public Law 113-296; 128 Stat. 4075) should be fully 
        implemented through enhanced, governmentwide, coordinated 
        United States-Israel scientific and technological cooperation 
        in civilian areas, such as with respect to energy, water, 
        agriculture, alternative fuel technology, civilian space 
        technology, and security in order to counter the effects of 
        actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel.

SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS RELATING TO FOREIGN BOYCOTTS UNDER 
              EXPORT CONTROL REFORM ACT OF 2018.

                new paragraph:
            ``(9) any requirement under section 1861(s)(7) or section 
        1834(l) that an ambulance service include the transport of an 
        individual to the extent necessary to allow payment for ground 
        ambulance services furnished in response to a 911 call (or the 
        equivalent in areas without a 911 call system) in cases in 
        which an individual would have been transported to a 
        destination permitted under Medicare regulations (as described 
        in section 410.40 to title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or 
        successor regulations)) but such transport did not occur as a 
        result of community-wide emergency medical service (EMS) 
        protocols due to the public health emergency described in 
        subsection (g)(1)(B).''; and
            (2) in the flush matter at the end, by adding at the end 
        the following: ``Ground ambulance services for which payment is 
        made pursuant to paragraph (9) shall be paid at the base rate 
        that would have been paid under the fee schedule established 
        under 1834(l) (excluding any mileage payment) if the individual 
        had been so transported and, with respect to ambulance services 
        furnished by a critical access hospital or an entity described 
        in paragraph (8) of such section, at the amount that otherwise 
        would be paid under such paragraph.''.

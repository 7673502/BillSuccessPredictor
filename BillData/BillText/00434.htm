            (4) On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services declared a public health emergency due to the spread 
        of COVID-19, and extended such declaration, more recently, on 
        January 7, 2021.
            (5) In August 2020, Congress provided an additional $725 
        million in supplemental funding to augment mental health and 
        substance use services during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (6) Such supplemental funding included $425 million to the 
        Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, of 
        which--

            (8) The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated concerns about 
        the mental health and well-being of Americans.
            (9) A third of Americans are feeling severe anxiety, 
        according to Census Bureau data, and nearly a quarter show 
        signs of depression.
            (10) A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found 
        that the pandemic had negatively affected the mental health of 
        56 percent of adults.
            (11) In April 2020, texts to a Federal emergency mental-
        health line were up 1,000 percent from the year before.
            (12) The situation is particularly dire for certain

            (13) In overburdened intensive-care units, delirious 
        patients are seeing chilling hallucinations.
            (14) At least two overwhelmed emergency medical workers 
        have died by suicide since the beginning of the COVID-19 
        pandemic.
            (15) The public mental health crisis will continue after 
        the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
protect the health and safety of all Americans during public health

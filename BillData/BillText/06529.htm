Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)(6))) with respect to how to 
educate tenants about self-closing doors, and other health and safety 
measures, to help advance primary prevention and prevent future deaths

                the report is submitted in buildings containing a 
                covered federally assisted dwelling unit and what fire 
                safety features such buildings had installed, including

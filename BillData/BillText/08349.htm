                        placement, the child cannot be adequately cared 
                        for in a less restrictive setting until the

            (3) Services available in a less restrictive placement.--
                    (A) In general.--If services are identified that 
                have the potential to maintain such an unaccompanied 
                noncitizen child in a less restrictive placement, the 
                Director shall ensure that the child receives such 
                services before the Director considers a transfer to a 
                restrictive placement.

                        the Director shall explicitly identify services 
                        and accommodations that could be made available

                        the Director against placing such an 
                        unaccompanied noncitizen child in a less 
                        restrictive placement shall be supported by 
                        specific documentation as to the reasons that, 
                        even with such accommodations, the child cannot 
                        be safely placed in a less restrictive 
                        placement.
            (4) Independent review.--

                so transfer shall be reviewed by an independent third 
                party licensed psychologist or psychiatrist who is 
                experienced in the care of children in accordance with 
                a standardized process for evaluating the data and 
                presented rationale, including a consideration of 
                accommodations that could avoid the need for 
                restrictive placement.
                    (B) Continued restrictive placement.--In the case 
                of such an unaccompanied noncitizen child in a 
                restrictive placement whom the Director does not intend 
                to transfer to a less restrictive placement, before the 
                child's next placement review hearing, the decision 
                shall be reviewed by an independent third party 
                licensed psychologist or psychiatrist who is 
                experienced in the care of children, in accordance with 
                a standardized process for evaluating the data and 
                presented rationale, including a consideration of 
                accommodations that could avoid the need for 
                restrictive placement.

                conducting a review under this paragraph, the

                the review to the fact finder, the child concerned, the 
                legal counsel and child advocate of such child, and the 
                Director.

                Director shall--
                            (i) take into consideration the legal 
                        rights of any parent, legal guardian, or family 
                        member who is seeking sponsorship of the child; 
                        and
                            (ii) ensure that Office of Refugee 
                        Resettlement processes for ensuring the child's 
                        safe release do not interfere with such rights.
                    (B) Parents.--A parent shall not be denied 
                reunification with their child absent a determination 
                supported by clear and convincing evidence that custody 
                of the child by the parent is likely to result in 
                serious emotional or physical damage to the child.
            (5) Assessment required.--
                    (A) In general.--The Director may only release an 
                unaccompanied noncitizen child to an individual or a 
                licensed program for whom a prospective sponsor

                requirements of section 235(c)(3) of the William 
                Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection 
                Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(3)).
                    (B) Elements.--A sponsor assessment shall include--
                            (i) a completed family reunification 
                        application; and
                            (ii) consideration of the wishes and 
                        concerns of the unaccompanied noncitizen child 
                        concerned.
                    (C) Opportunity to address concerns.--A prospective 
                sponsor shall be afforded the opportunity to address 
                any concern raised during the sponsor assessment 
                process before the prospective sponsor's application is 
                denied.
                    (D) Background checks.--
                            (i) In general.--Fingerprint-based checks 
                        of national crime information databases (as 
                        defined in section 534(f)(3) of title 28, 
                        United States Code) may be requested for 
                        prospective sponsors if a public records check 
                        of the sponsor reveals safety concerns or there 
                        is a documented risk to the safety of the 
                        child.
                            (ii) Limitation.--The criminal history of 
                        the prospective sponsor, or a household member 
                        of the prospective sponsor, shall not be a 
                        basis for denial of sponsorship unless the 
                        Director demonstrates that such history 
                        includes a conviction for child abuse or 
                        trafficking, or is less than 10 years old and 
                        would have a direct and immediate impact on the

                    (A) In general.--The Director shall implement 
                safeguards to prevent any information obtained in the 
                course of the sponsor assessment process from being 
                used for any purpose other than assessing the sponsor's 
                fitness to care for an unaccompanied noncitizen child.
                    (B) Applicability.--Such safeguards shall apply 
                regardless of the outcome of the prospective sponsor's

                    (A) In general.--Not less frequently than annually, 
                the Director shall conduct an evaluation of Office of 
                Refugee Resettlement policies and practices to 
                determine whether such policies and practices create 
                unnecessary barriers to release or result in delays in 
                unaccompanied noncitizen children's prompt release to 
                sponsors.
                    (B) Submission to ombudsperson.--The Director shall

            (1) In general.--Not later than 7 days after the date on 
        which the Director receives a family reunification application 
        from a prospective sponsor, the Director shall make a 
        determination with respect to whether the unaccompanied 
        noncitizen child concerned may be placed with the sponsor.
            (2) Consideration of effect of denial.--In making a 
        determination under paragraph (1), the Director shall take into 
        consideration the effect a denial of the application, and 
        continued immigration custody for the unaccompanied noncitizen 
        child concerned, would have on--
                    (A) the health and well-being of the child; and
                    (B) in the case of a prospective sponsor who is a

                family member to the care and custody of the child.

                            (i) a determination that a prospective 
                        sponsor is not fit to receive the unaccompanied

                            (ii) failure by the Director to make a

                                                requirement to issue 
                                                such a written

                    (J) Continued efforts by office of refugee 
                resettlement.--During the pendency of a hearing under 
                this paragraph, and any review of a decision resulting

SEC. 233. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO RELEASE OF CHILDREN WITH 
              DISABILITIES.

    (a) In General.--The Director may not delay the release of an 
unaccompanied noncitizen child based solely on a pending evaluation for 
services under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 
794).
    (b) Supporting Evidence Required for Determination Not To 
Release.--A determination by the Director not to release an 
unaccompanied noncitizen child receiving services under such section 
based on a prospective sponsor's inability to meet the needs of the 
child shall be supported by evidence of efforts by the Director to 
educate, and provide concrete resources and support to, the prospective 
sponsor through the provision of post-release services.
    (c) Release to Parents.--The Director may not deny the 
reunification of an unaccompanied noncitizen child receiving services 
under such section with his or her parent absent a determination 
supported by clear and convincing evidence that--
            (1) custody of the child by the parent is likely to result 
        in serious emotional or physical damage to the child; and
            (2) continued Office of Refugee Resettlement custody is the 
        least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the 
        child.
    (d) Review.--
            (1) In general.--With respect to a determination by the 
        Director not to release an unaccompanied noncitizen child 
        receiving services under such section based on an assessment 
        that the child is a danger to himself or herself or to others, 
        a review of such determination shall be carried out by an 
        independent third party licensed psychologist or psychiatrist 
        who is experienced in the care of children before the date on 
        which the sponsorship hearing under section 232(b)(3) occurs.
            (2) Procedure.--A review under paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) be carried out using a standardized method for 
                evaluating the data and shall include the rationale for 
                denying release; and
                    (B) consider the availability of assistive services 
                or technology that could be provided to the 
                unaccompanied noncitizen child concerned if he or she 
                were released.
            (3) Availability.--Such a review shall be made in writing 
        and made available to the unaccompanied noncitizen child and 
        the child's legal counsel before the date on which a 
        sponsorship hearing under section 232(b)(3) occurs.
    (e) Office of Refugee Resettlement Support for Sponsors.--With 
respect to children with disabilities released from the custody of the 
Secretary, the Director shall support and assist sponsors in accessing 
and coordinating post-release community-based services and support or 
technology, to the extent such services and support are available.
    (f) Alternative Placement.--If a sponsor is not identified for an 
unaccompanied noncitizen child who receives services under section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), the Director shall 
make every effort to place the child in therapeutic foster care, foster 
care, or the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program.

            (2) Case management specialist determination.--The Director 
        may only require post-release services to be in place before 
        releasing an unaccompanied noncitizen child to a sponsor if, 
        after conducting an individualized assessment of the 
        particularized needs of the child, the case management 
        specialist makes a determination that the child would be at 
        risk of imminent physical or emotional harm if post-release 
        services were not in place before such release.
    (b) Expansion.--The Director shall provide post-release services to 
unaccompanied noncitizen children, including by--

            (3) ensuring access to family reunification and medical 
        support services, including support and trauma-informed 
        counseling for the family and mental health counseling, through 
        direct provision of such services or through partnerships and 
        referrals to services in the community; and
            (4) ensuring that sponsors of children with special medical 
        needs receive Office of Refugee Resettlement support in 
        accessing appropriate medical care.

SEC. 243. INDIVIDUALS ATTAINING 18 YEARS OF AGE.

    (a) Presumption of Release on Recognizance.--
            (1) In general.--If an individual in the custody of the 
        Secretary is not released to a sponsor before the individual 
        attains the age of 18 years, there shall be a presumption that 
        the individual shall be released on an order of recognizance.
            (2) Rebuttal.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
        bear the burden of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, in 
        overcoming the presumption under paragraph (1) and in 
        demonstrating that such an individual is not eligible to be

                individual shall be eligible to participate in 
                noncustodial alternatives to detention programs 
                provided by the Department of Health and Human

                management, legal counsel, and other support services 
                during the pendency of the individual's immigration 
                proceedings; and
                    (B) information on applying for special immigrant

    (b) Post-18 Plan for Individuals Aging Out of Custody.--
            (1) In general.--The Director shall develop a post-18 plan

                release to an organizational or individual sponsor is 
                not successful.
    (c) Post-18 Program.--With respect to an individual in the custody 
of the Secretary who attains 18 years of age before reunification, 
placement with a sponsor, or adjudication with respect to immigration 
status, the Director may extend Office of Refugee Resettlement custody 
for a period ending not later than the date on which the individual 
attains 21 years of age, if the individual--

        available for reunification;
            (B) has an identified sponsor;

        not yet been adjudicated with respect to immigration status by 
        a local court in the applicable jurisdiction; and
            (2) solely at his or her discretion, without coercion and 
        on the recommendation of his or her case manager, elects to 
        remain in Office of Refugee Resettlement custody in the post-18

    (d) Consideration Relating to U.S. Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement Custody.--In considering a sponsorship application for an 
unaccompanied noncitizen child who may attain 18 years of age in the 
custody of the Secretary, the Director shall consider the potential

the child if the child were to be transferred to the custody of U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement on attaining such age.
    (e) Prohibition on Detention and Removal.--An individual who was in

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

influx facility, the Secretary and the Director should explore all 
other avenues for placing an unaccompanied noncitizen child in the 
least restrictive, State-licensed setting that most approximates a 
family and in which the special needs of the child, if any, may be met 
consistent with the best interests and special needs of the child.

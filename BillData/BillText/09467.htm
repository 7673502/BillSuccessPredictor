United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Vacating of Aircraft Cabin 
Act''.

SEC. 2. EVACUATION STANDARDS FOR TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES.

    (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
enactment of this section, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation 
Administration shall issue a final rule establishing evacuation 
standards for transport category airplanes, as described in part 25 of 
title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.
    (b) Considerations.--
            (1) In general.--In issuing the final rule under subsection 
        (a), the Administrator shall consider factors that include--
                    (A) the ability of passengers of different ages 
                (including infants, children, and senior citizens) to 
                safely and efficiently evacuate a transport category 
                airplane;
                    (B) the ability of passengers of different heights 
                and weights to safely and efficiently evacuate a 
                transport category airplane;
                    (C) the ability of passengers with disabilities to 
                safely and efficiently evacuate a transport category 
                airplane;
                    (D) the ability of passengers who cannot speak, 
                have difficulty speaking, use synthetic speech, or are 
                non-vocal or non-verbal to safely and efficiently 
                evacuate a transport category airplane;
                    (E) the ability of passengers who do not speak 
                English to safely and efficiently evacuate a transport 
                category airplane;
                    (F) the impact of the presence of carry-on luggage 
                or personal items (such as a purse, briefcase, laptop, 
                or backpack) on the ability of passengers to safely and 
                efficiently evacuate a transport category airplane;
                    (G) the impact of seat size and seat pitch on the 
                ability of passengers to safely and efficiently 
                evacuate a transport category airplane;
                    (H) the impact of seats and other obstacles in the 
                pathway to the exit opening from the nearest aisle on 
                the ability of passengers to safely and efficiently 
                evacuate a transport category airplane;
                    (I) with respect to aircraft with parallel 
                longitudinal aisles, the impact of seat pods or other 
                seating configurations that block access between such 
                aisles within a cabin on the ability of passengers to 
                safely and efficiently evacuate a transport category 
                airplane;
                    (J) the impact of passenger load (the number of 
                passengers relative to the number of seats on board) on 
                the ability of passengers to safely and efficiently 
                evacuate a transport category airplane;
                    (K) the impact of service animals and the ability 
                to safely and efficiently evacuate such animals from a 
                transport category airplane; and
                    (L) any other factor determined appropriate by the 
                Administrator.

                disability, as defined in section 382.3 of title 14, 
                Code of Federal Regulations; and
                    (B) includes any passengers--
                            (i) with a physical impairment, such as 
                        passengers who are blind, deaf, or require a 
                        wheelchair, walker, cane, brace, prosthetic, or 
                        other mobility device;
                            (ii) whose physical impairment requires the 
                        use of a medical device to assist with 
                        mobility, such as a portable oxygen 
                        concentrator; or
                            (iii) with a developmental or mental

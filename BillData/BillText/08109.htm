    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal Government manages more than 640,000,000 
        acres of public land that was carved out of the ancestral 
        homeland of Indian Tribes;
            (2) Indians Tribes and members of Indian Tribes--
                    (A) have maintained historical, religious, and 
                spiritual connections to land now designated as public 
                land;
                    (B) continue to exercise treaty rights on public 
                land; and
                    (C) use public land to pray, conduct ceremonies, 
                visit burial sites, gather plants, and undertake other 
                traditional cultural activities;
            (3) treaties, Executive orders, court decisions, and 
        Federal laws and regulations--
                    (A) acknowledge the rights of Indian Tribes and 
                members of Indian Tribes on public land; and
                    (B) require public land managers to consult with 
                Indian Tribes prior to taking action that would impact 
                those rights; and
            (4) efforts to commercially develop or transfer ownership 
        of public land often ignore the rights and protections of 
        Indian Tribes and have resulted in--
                    (A) the desecration of sacred sites;
                    (B) the diminishment of Tribal treaty rights; and
                    (C) the mismanagement of sacred sites, including 
                the looting of sacred objects and burial sites and the 
                diminishment of harvests of traditional native plants 
                used in religious ceremonies and for other purposes.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

            (1) the preservation of Tribal cultural sites located on 
        public land is in the public interest;
            (2) through their unique history and traditional knowledge, 
        Indian Tribes have an important role in managing Tribal 
        cultural sites on public land; and
            (3) Tribal cultural sites on public land should be 
        permanently protected for the benefit of Indian Tribes.

SEC. 5. TRIBAL CULTURAL AREAS SYSTEM.

    (a) Establishment.--In order to preserve Tribal cultural sites on 
public land, there is established the Tribal Cultural Areas System.

            (2) to permanently protect the religious, cultural, 
        spiritual, scenic, ecological, medicinal, and traditional 
        values of Tribal cultural sites; and
            (3) to enhance opportunities for Indian Tribes to engage in 
        the preservation and management of Tribal cultural sites on 
        public land.
    (c) Areas Included.--
            (1) Eligible cultural sites.--Any Tribal cultural site

        as a Tribal cultural area for inclusion in the System only by

            (3) Secretarial recommendation.--In determining whether to 
        designate a Tribal cultural site as a Tribal cultural area for 
        inclusion in the System, Congress shall take into consideration 
        the recommendations of the Secretary concerned under 
        subsections (a)(6) and (d)(3)(C)(ii)(I) of section 8.
            (4) Removal.--A Tribal cultural area may be removed from 
        the System only by an Act of Congress.

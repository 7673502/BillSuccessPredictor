        cover the cost of financial transaction fees, including any fee 
        established, charged, or received by a payment card network for 
        the purpose of compensating an issuer for its involvement in a 
        transaction in which a person uses a debit card or credit card 
        (as the terms ``debit card'', ``credit card'', ``issuer, and

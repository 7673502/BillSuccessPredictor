supply chain or distribution network.
    (b) Affirmative Defense.--
            (1) In general.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the

                    (B) the person demonstrates by a preponderance of 
                the evidence that the increase in the price of the good 
                or service involved is directly attributable to 
                additional costs that are not within the control of the 
                person and are incurred by the person in procuring, 
                acquiring, distributing, or providing the good or 
                service.
            (2) Inflation adjustment.--Starting in calendar year 2023, 
        the Commission shall annually adjust the amount specified in

        Statistics.
    (c) Presumptive Violations.--A person shall be presumed to be in 
violation of subsection (a) if, during an exceptional market shock, it 
is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the person--
            (1)(A) has unfair leverage; or
            (B) is using the effects or circumstances related to the 
        exceptional market shock as a pretext to increase prices; and
            (2) regardless of the person's position in a supply chain 
        or distribution network, sells or offers for sale a good or 
        service at an excessive price compared to--
                    (A) the average price at which the good or service 
                was sold or offered for sale by all competing sellers 
                in the market during the 120-day period preceding such 
                exceptional market shock; or
                    (B) the average price at which the good or service 
                was sold or offered for sale by the person in the 
                market during the 120-day period preceding such 
                exceptional market shock.
    (d) Rebuttal.--A person may rebut a presumption under subsection 
(c) if the person demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that 
the increase in the price of the good or service involved is directly 
attributable to additional costs that are not within the control of the 
person and are incurred by the person in procuring, acquiring, 
distributing, or providing the good or service.
    (e) Unfair Leverage.--

                States revenue during the preceding 12-month period;
                    (B) discriminates between otherwise equal trading 
                partners in the same market by applying differential 
                prices or conditions;
                    (C) is a critical trading partner; or
                    (D) has a characteristic described in a rule 
                promulgated by the Commission that further defines 
                unfair leverage.

                    (A) if the person who committed the violation does 
                not have unfair leverage, the lesser of--
                            (i) $25,000; or
                            (ii) 5 percent of the revenues earned by

                    (B) Required guidance.--Not later than 180 days 
                after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission 
                shall promulgate regulations regarding violations of 
                this Act, which shall include guidelines on what

                good or service.
            (6) Effect on other laws.--Nothing in this section shall be

            (1) In general.--If the attorney general of a State, or 
        another official or agency designated by a State, has reason to 
        believe that any person has violated or is violating this 
        section, the attorney general, official, or agency of the 
        State, in addition to any authority it may have to bring an 
        action in State court under its laws, may bring a civil action 
        in any appropriate United States district court or in any other 
        court of competent jurisdiction, including a State court, to--
                    (A) enjoin any further such violation by such

        general, official, or agency determines that it is not feasible 
        to provide the notice described in this paragraph before the 
        filing of the action, the attorney general, official, or agency 
        shall provide written notice of the action and a copy of the 
        complaint to the Commission immediately upon the filing of the 
        action.
            (3) Limitation on state action while federal action is 
        pending.--If the Commission has instituted a civil action for a 
        violation of this section, no State attorney general, or 
        official or agency of a State, may bring an action under this

        general of a State has authority to bring an action under State 
        law directed at acts or practices that also violate this 
        section, the attorney general may assert the State-law claim 
        and a claim under this section in the same civil action.
    (h) Savings Clause.--Nothing in this section shall preempt or 
otherwise affect any State or local law.

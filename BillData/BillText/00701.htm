                    IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

                            February 2, 2021

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 to provide for 
 regulatory impact analyses for certain rules, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Unfunded Mandates Accountability and 
Transparency Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The public has a right to know the benefits and costs 
        of regulation. Effective regulatory programs provide important 
        benefits to the public, including protecting the environment, 
        worker safety, and human health. Regulations also impose 
        significant costs on individuals, employers, and State, local, 
        and Tribal governments, diverting resources from other 
        important priorities.
            (2) Better regulatory analysis and review should improve 
        the quality of agency decisions, increasing the benefits and 
        reducing unwarranted costs of regulation.
            (3) Disclosure and scrutiny of key information underlying 
        agency decisions should make the Federal Government more 
        accountable to the public it serves.

SEC. 3. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSES FOR CERTAIN RULES.

    The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.) is 
amended--
            (1) by striking ``tribal'' each place that term appears and 
        inserting ``Tribal'';
            (2) in section 3 (2 U.S.C. 1502)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the 
                end;
                    (B) in paragraph (2), by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``and''; and

        section 551 of title 5, United States Code, that the

                employment, investment, productivity, innovation, 
                public health and safety, or the ability of United 
                States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based 
                enterprises in domestic and export markets.''; and

            ``(2) Agencies shall consult with a wide variety of State, 
        local, and Tribal officials and impacted parties within the 
        private sector (including small businesses). Geographic, 
        political, and other factors that may differentiate varying 
        points of view should be considered.
            ``(3) Agencies should estimate benefits and costs to assist 
        with these consultations. The scope of the consultation should

                compliance and potential flexibilities, and input on 
                whether the Federal regulation will harmonize with and 
                not duplicate similar laws in other levels of 
                government.
            ``(5) Consultations shall address the cumulative impact of 
        regulations on the affected entities.
            ``(6) Agencies may accept electronic submissions of 
        comments by relevant parties but may not use those comments as 
        the sole method of satisfying the guidelines in this 
        subsection.''.

arise within the scope of the statutory provision that authorizes the 
rulemaking.

required under subsection (b) only if--

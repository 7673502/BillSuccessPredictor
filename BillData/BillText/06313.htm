                                 A BILL


 
    To designate the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based 
   outpatient clinic in French Camp, California, as the ``Richard A. 
      Pittman Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Sgt. Richard A. Pittman was born on May 26, 1945, in 
        French Camp, California.
            (2) Sgt. Pittman enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1965.
            (3) On July 24, 1966, Sgt. Pittman's unit was moving along 
        a trail near the demilitarized zone in the Republic of Vietnam 
        when the marines ahead of them came under attack.
            (4) Upon hearing the attack, Sgt. Pittman took a machine 
        gun and several belts of ammunition and rushed to aid his 
        comrades. As he moved towards the attacked marines, Sgt. 
        Pittman came under heavy fire from two automatic weapons, which 
        he was able to destroy.
            (5) When Sgt. Pittman learned there were additional wounded 
        marines further along the trail, he endured enemy mortar and 
        gunfire to get to them. As he reached them, he faced an attack 
        by 30 to 40 enemy fighters.
            (6) Sgt. Pittman used a combination of machine-gun fire, an 
        enemy submachine gun, a pistol from a fallen comrade, and a 
        grenade to cause the enemy force to withdraw. Due to his 
        courageous actions that day, many of his wounded comrades were 
        saved.
            (7) In recognition of his bravery that day, Sgt. Pittman 
        was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson 
        on May 14, 1968.

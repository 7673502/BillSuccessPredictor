                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Public Health Service Act to sustain senior congregate 
care operations in the wake of ongoing COVID-19 financial burdens, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Safeguarding Elderly Needs for 
Infrastructure and Occupational Resources Act of 2022'' or the ``SENIOR 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Long-term care facilities and senior congregate care 
        homes provide direct and personalized care, where social 
        distancing is not possible, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
            (2) Assisted living, memory care, independent living, and 
        other senior congregate care settings are the homes of 
        America's seniors and critical options on the long-term care 
        continuum; these senior residences provide safety and security 
        for our Nation's most vulnerable population.
            (3) Sixty percent of a senior's health is based on social 
        determinants of health which include the need for adequate 
        nutrition, housing, and social activities; thus supporting 
        caregivers and home- and community-based care models that 
        prioritize the social determinants of senior health should be a 
        priority of the Congress.
            (4) Investing in senior care and the caregiving workforce 
        prevents hospitalization and skilled nursing expenses, 
        preserving Medicare and Medicaid budgets.
            (5) Since March of 2020, senior care facilities have lost 
        over 380,000 caregivers and are experiencing a workforce crisis 
        as America's population rapidly ages.
            (6) By 2030, the entire Baby Boomer Generation will be 65 
        years of age or older.
            (7) By 2060, nearly 95 million Americans will be 65 years 
        of age or older and the portion of the population over 85 years 
        of age will have tripled to nearly 20 million persons.
            (8) Fifty-two percent of individuals require long-term care 
        by age 65. Individuals over 65 years of age are 70 percent more 
        likely to need long-term care, with half of those seniors 
        requiring an even higher level of care.
            (9) The average duration of long-term care is nearly 4 
        years, and 14 percent of individuals need long-term care for 5 
        or more years.
            (10) Twenty-seven percent of seniors over 65 years of age 
        will spend at least $100,000 on long-term care, and 15 percent 
        will have costs for long-term care surpassing $250,000.
            (11) The average cost for long-term care for a 65-year old 
        today is $138,000.
            (12) Long-term care infrastructure must address the 
        availability of cost-effective care and housing options to meet 
        the growing needs of the Nation's aging population.
            (13) On average, assisted living costs $4,300 per month, 
        which equals $5.91 per hour of available care (based on 24/7 
        care). Nursing homes cost $8,821 per month (or $13.13 per hour 
        based on 24/7 care). In-home care costs $4,576 per month (or 
        $26 per hour based on 44 hours per week care).
            (14) An individual 85 years of age or older is 630 percent 
        more likely to die of COVID-19.
            (15) Sixty-three percent of residents of long-term care 
        facilities need assistance with bathing; 48 percent need 
        assistance with dressing; and 40 percent need assistance with 
        toileting.
            (16) More than 42 percent of residents of long-term care 
        facilities suffer from Alzheimer's disease or some other form 
        of dementia.
            (17) The people of the United States are a compassionate 
        people who are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in 
        our society, and we should not jeopardize the financial 
        underpinnings of the long-term care communities our Nation's 
        senior citizens depend on day-in and day-out.

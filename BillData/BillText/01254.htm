                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 40, United States Code, to modify certain requirements 
 for Federal agencies in the disposition of surplus real property, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Eliminate Agency Excess Space Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Under the status quo, empty Federal agency office 
        buildings cannot be sold by agencies that want to be efficient. 
        Instead, each agency must let their vacant office spaces remain 
        a purposeless and excessive cost on their balance sheets.
            (2) According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service 
        report, in fiscal year 2016, U.S. Federal agencies owned 3,120 
        buildings that were vacant or unutilized and owned another 
        7,859 buildings that were partially empty or underutilized.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Federal agencies should not be limited when placing 
        unused or underused office space on the market for sale; and
            (2) Federal agencies should be able to sell their unused 
        offices to provide for greater fiscal responsibility and better 
        stewardship of taxpayer dollars.

SEC. 3. REMOVAL OF GSA VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT.

    (a) In General.--Section 524 of title 40, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) by striking subsection (a);
            (2) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) in paragraph (1) by striking the semicolon and 
                inserting ``; and'';
                    (B) by striking paragraph (2); and
                    (C) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph 
                (2); and
            (3) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections 
        (a) and (b), respectively.
    (b) Procedure for Disposal.--Section 545 of title 40, United States 
Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) in paragraph (7) by striking the semicolon and 
                inserting ``; or'';
                    (B) by striking paragraph (8); and
                    (C) by redesignating paragraph (9) as paragraph 
                (8); and
            (2) in subsection (d)--
                    (A) by striking ``Negotiated Sale at Fixed Price'' 
                and all that follows through ``The Administrator may'' 
                and inserting ``Negotiated Sale at Fixed Price.--The 
                Administrator may''; and
                    (B) by striking paragraph (2).
    (c) Real Property.--Chapter 5 of title 40, United States Code, is

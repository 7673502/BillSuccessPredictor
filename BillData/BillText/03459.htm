    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Regional Impact of Disasters and

SEC. 2. CONTIGUOUS AREA.

    Title IV of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end 
the following:

``SEC. 431. CONTIGUOUS AREA.

    ``(a) In General.--Any area under the jurisdiction of a State or 
local government that is contiguous to an area that the President 
designates as eligible to receive any form of covered assistance as a 
result of a major disaster may be deemed by the Administrator of the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to be eligible to receive such 
assistance with respect to such disaster.
    ``(b) Definition.--In this section, the term `covered assistance' 
means--
            ``(1) hazard mitigation assistance provided under section 
        404;
            ``(2) any assistance provided to an individual or household 
        under sections 408, 410, 415, 416, or 426; and
            ``(3) any public assistance provided under sections 403, 
        406, or 407.''.

SEC. 3. CUMULATIVE DAMAGE.

    (a) Definitions.--Section 102(2) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5122(2)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ```Major disaster' means'' and inserting 
        ``(A) In general.--The term `major disaster' means''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(B) Inclusion.--The term `major disaster' 
                includes more than 1 natural catastrophe, fire, flood, 
                or explosion described in subparagraph (A) that occurs 
                in a 12-month period and that individually does not 
                cause damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to 
                warrant major disaster assistance under this Act, but 
                that, in the determination of the President, 
                cumulatively causes damage of sufficient severity and 
                magnitude to warrant such assistance.''.
    (b) Interim Guidance.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency shall issue interim guidance to implement the 
amendments made by subsection (a).

        Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-254); and
            (2) implement the amendments made by subsection (a).

                    (B) in fragile or conflict-affected states; or
                    (C) in regions that otherwise have an elevated risk 
                of gross violations of internationally recognized human 
                rights.
            (2) Specific award condition audits.--The Director shall

    (i) Remedies for Noncompliance.--Each agreement for financial 
assistance made by the Director with a covered recipient is subject to 
the provisions of subpart D of part 200 of chapter II of subtitle A of 
title 2 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Director may consider, 
in determining an appropriate remedy of a violation of a grant 
requirement under such provision, whether the covered recipient was in 
compliance with subsection (a)(1)(D) at the time of such violation.
    (j) Annual Report.--The Director, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, shall, not later than 1 year after the date of

        under subsection (f)(2), including the purpose and duration of 
        such investigation;
            (3) each administrative action taken with respect to a 
        covered recipient to enforce this Act;
            (4) information about the action taken by each covered 
        recipient to abate a gross violation of internationally 
        recognized human rights;
            (5) information about remedial actions taken by the 
        Director pursuant to subsection (i);
            (6) explanations for each extension of time given under 
        subsection (d)(3); and
            (7) a summary of allegations and information that the 
        Director did not refer to the Inspector General and the 
        explanation for why such information was not referred.
    (k) Safeguard for Sensitive Information.--In carrying out this 
section, the Director may take such measures and withhold such 
information as the Director determines necessary to protect the safety 
of individuals--
            (1) who are victims, or at risk of being victims, of a 
        gross violation of internationally recognized human rights; and
            (2) who provide information regarding a potential gross 
        violation of internationally recognized human rights.

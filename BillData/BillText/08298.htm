SEC. 2. PLAN TO ENSURE REASONABLE ACCESS TO THE JUNIOR RESERVE 
              OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS.

    (a) Plan Required.--The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with 
the Secretaries of the military departments, shall develop a plan to 
increase the total number of units of the Junior Reserve Officers' 
Training Corps to ensure that there is reasonable access to such units 
in each geographic region of the United States by not later than 
September 30, 2031.
    (b) Elements.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall include 
the following:
            (1) A proposal to increase the total number of units of the 
        Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps to ensure reasonable 
        access for students throughout the United States.
            (2) The estimated cost of implementing the proposed 
        increase in the number of such units.
            (3) A prioritized list of the States and regions in which 
        the Secretary proposes adding additional units.
            (4) Actions the Secretary expects to carry out to ensure 
        adequate representation and fair access to such units for 
        students in all regions of the United States, including rural 
        and remote areas and in underrepresented States.
            (5) To the extent appropriate, modifications to the 
        requirements for such units, including the requirements 
        applicable to instructors, to accommodate units in rural areas 
        and small schools.
            (6) A plan to increase school and community awareness of 
        Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs in 
        underrepresented areas.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of 
Representatives a report that includes the plan developed under 
subsection (a).
    (d) Reasonable Access Defined.--In this section, the term 
``reasonable access'', when used with respect to units of the Junior 
Reserve Officers' Training Corps, means a level of access determined by 
the Secretary of Defense to be reasonable taking into account the 
demand for student participation, the availability of instructors, and 
the physical distance between units.

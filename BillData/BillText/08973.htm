  To amend title 38, United States Code, to increase the rate of the 
  special pension payable to Medal of Honor recipients, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medal of Honor Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Medal of Honor is the highest and most prestigious 
        military decoration of the United States.
            (2) To earn the Medal of Honor ``the deed of the person . . 
        . must be so outstanding that it clearly distinguishes his 
        gallantry beyond the call of duty from lesser forms of 
        bravery''.
            (3) The actions of Medal of Honor recipients inspire 
        bravery, and the willingness to give all, in those who serve in 
        the Armed Forces and those who will serve in the future.
            (4) Those listed on the Medal of Honor Roll exemplify the 
        best traits of members of the Armed Forces, a long and proud 
        lineage of those who went beyond the call of duty.
            (5) Pursuant to section 1562 of title 38, United States 
        Code, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall pay monthly to 
        each living person whose name has been entered on the Army, 
        Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard Medal of Honor Roll a special 
        pension.
            (6) Recipients of the Medal of Honor have earned a 
        substantial and historic increase to such special pension in 
        recognition of their conspicuous gallantry, unwavering 
        commitment, and heroic actions above and beyond the call of 
        duty.

SEC. 3. INCREASE IN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SPECIAL PENSION 
              PAYABLE TO MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS.

    (a) Increase in Special Pension Payable to Living Medal of Honor 
Recipients.--Section 1562(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended by striking ``$1,388.68'' and inserting ``$8,333.33''.
    (b) Amount of Special Pension Payable to Surviving Spouses.--
Section 1562(a)(2)(A) of title 38, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking ``special pension under this section'' and 
        inserting ``monthly''; and
            (2) by striking the period and adding at the end the 
        following: ``a special pension under this section at the rate 
        of $1,489.73, as adjusted from time to time under subsection 
        (e).''.

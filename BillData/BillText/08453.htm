            (3) to encourage officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
        resume institutional participation at all levels of government

        prosperity and for Bosnia and Herzegovina to obtain European 
        Union candidate status;
            (4) to push Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the rulings

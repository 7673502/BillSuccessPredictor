_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit discrimination against the unborn on the basis of sex, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act of 
2022'' or the ``PRENDA Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Women and girls possess the same fundamental human 
        rights and civil rights as men and are essential to the 
        formation of stable, peaceful societies.
            (2) Approximately 126,000,000 women and girls are missing 
        from the world population due to systematic violence against 
        women and girls, particularly sex-selection abortions, 
        according to the United Nations Population Fund.
            (3) United States law prohibits the dissimilar treatment of 
        males and females who are similarly situated and prohibits sex 
        discrimination in various contexts, including the provision of 
        employment, education, housing, health insurance coverage, and 
        athletics.
            (4) A ``sex-selection abortion'' is an abortion undertaken 
        for purposes of eliminating an unborn child of an undesired 
        sex. Sex-selection abortion is described by scholars and civil 
        rights advocates as an act of sex-based or gender-based 
        violence, predicated on sex discrimination. By definition, sex-
        selection abortions do not implicate the health of the mother 
        of the unborn, but instead are elective procedures motivated by 
        sex or gender bias.
            (5) The targeted victims of sex-selection abortions 
        performed in the United States and worldwide are overwhelmingly 
        female.
            (6) Sex-selection abortions are not expressly prohibited by 
        United States law, and only 7 States ban abortions for reason 
        of sex selection at some point in pregnancy. Sex is an 
        immutable characteristic ascertainable at the earliest stages 
        of human development through existing medical technology and 
        procedures commonly in use, including maternal-fetal 
        bloodstream DNA sampling, amniocentesis, chorionic villus 
        sampling or ``CVS'', and obstetric ultrasound.
            (7) Sex-selection abortions have the effect of diminishing 
        the representation of women in the American population, and 
        therefore, the American electorate.
            (8) Sex-selection abortions reinforce sex discrimination 
        and have no place in a civilized society.
            (9) The history of the United States includes many examples 
        of sex discrimination. The people of the United States 
        ultimately responded in the strongest possible legal terms by 
        enacting a constitutional amendment correcting an element of 
        this discrimination. Women, once subjected to sex 
        discrimination that denied them the right to vote, now have 
        suffrage guaranteed by the 19th Amendment. The elimination of 
        discriminatory practices has been and is among the highest 
        priorities and greatest achievements of American history.
            (10) Implicitly approving the discriminatory practices of 
        sex-selection abortion by choosing not to prohibit them will 
        reinforce sex discrimination, and coarsen society to the value 
        of females. Thus, Congress has a compelling interest in 
        acting--indeed it must act--to prohibit sex-selection abortion.
    (b) Constitutional Authority.--In accordance with the above 
findings, Congress enacts the following pursuant to Congress' power 
under--
            (1) the Commerce Clause;
            (2) section 5 of the 14th Amendment, including the power to 
        enforce the prohibition on government action denying equal 
        protection of the laws; and
            (3) section 8 of article I to make all laws necessary and 
        proper for the carrying into execution of powers vested by the 
        Constitution in the Government of the United States.

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide a transitional 
option to permit States to submit their own mapping data to use for any 
       broadband-related funding program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reviewing and Updating Regional And 
Local Broadband Mapping Act'' or the ``RURAL Broadband Mapping Act''.

SEC. 2. TRANSITIONAL MAP OPTION FOR THE FORM 477 PROCESS.

    Section 802(b)(6) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 
642(b)(6)) is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Transitional state map option.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Not later than 60 days 
                        after the date of enactment of this 
                        subparagraph, the Commission shall accept the 
                        submission of broadband mapping data from a 
                        State to use for any application for funding 
                        with respect to the deployment of broadband 
                        internet access service in such State where 
                        such application requires the use of Form 477 
                        data, if the Commission determines the data 
                        from the State is superior than the broadband 
                        mapping data used by the Commission.
                            ``(ii) Termination.--The requirement under 
                        clause (i) shall terminate on the day on which 
                        the Commission determines that the Commission 
                        has created all maps required by subsection 
                        (c).''.

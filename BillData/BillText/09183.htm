        recreational target shooting.
            (2) Minimum number of ranges.--To the maximum extent 
        practicable--
                    (A) the Secretary of Agriculture shall ensure that 
                each National Forest has not fewer than 1 designated 
                shooting range; and
                    (B) the Secretary shall ensure each Bureau of Land

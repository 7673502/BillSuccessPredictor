                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to end the tax subsidy for 
 employer efforts to influence their workers' exercise of their rights 
     around labor organizations and engaging in collective action.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Tax Breaks for Union Busting 
(NTBUB) Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et 
        seq.) declares that it is the right of employees to form, join, 
        or assist labor organizations.
            (2) The National Labor Relations Act further declares that 
        it is ``the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes 
        of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of 
        commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when 
        they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of 
        collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers 
        of full freedom of association, self-organization, and 
        designation of representatives of their own choosing . . .''.
            (3) Despite Congress' intention to give workers full agency 
        in these matters, many employers regularly choose to involve 
        themselves, lawfully or unlawfully, in the decisions of their 
        employees about whether to avail themselves of their rights 
        under the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor 
        Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).
            (4) Employers frequently violate labor laws around 
        organizing and collective action. The Economic Policy Institute 
        finds that in approximately 4 of 10 labor organization 
        elections in 2016-2017 employers were charged with committing 
        an unfair labor practice. Among larger bargaining units of 61 
        employees or more, over 54 percent of elections have an unfair 
        labor practice charge.
            (5) In practice, these unfair labor practices often include 
        charges such as employees being illegally fired for labor 
        organization activity, refusal to bargain in good faith with 
        labor organizations, or coercion and intimidation. Employers 
        also frequently use captive audience meetings, workplace 
        surveillance, and other lawful or unlawful tactics to sway 
        labor organization elections.
            (6) Whether or not there are charges of unlawful behavior, 
        employers spend millions of dollars to sway the opinions of 
        their employees with respect to whether or how to exercise 
        their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and the 
        Railway Labor Act. According to the Economic Policy Institute 
        report, companies spent $340,000,000 yearly on outside 
        consultants to sway their workers' opinions about labor 
        organization activities. This and other spending interfere with 
        the United States goal of ``encouraging the practice and 
        procedure of collective bargaining''.
            (7) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has long recognized 
        that spending by businesses with the purpose of influencing the 
        general public with respect to elections, while it may be 
        lawful, is not tax deductible. Congress should extend that 
        principle to spending done by employers to influence workers' 
        elections and collective bargaining decisions. These free 
        choices to exercise the rights to engage in collective 
        bargaining, labor organization representation, and other lawful 
        collective activities should be made without taxpayer subsidies 
        of undue outside influence from employers.

SEC. 3. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE EMPLOYEES WITH 
              RESPECT TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OR LABOR ORGANIZATION 
              ACTIVITIES.

                employees with respect to labor organizations or labor 
                organization activities, including with respect to the 
                opinion of such employees regarding such organizations

              NATURAL GAS PRICES IN RELATION TO WINTER STORM URI.

a study designed to reveal who benefitted from the dramatic increases 
in natural gas prices on the spot market and day-ahead markets in 
relation to Winter Storm Uri.
    (b) Report to the Congress.--Within 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall

SEC. 3. RULEMAKING TO REQUIRE IMPOSITION OF NATURAL GAS TRADING LIMITS 
              IN THE SPOT AND DAY-AHEAD MARKETS DURING EMERGENCY.

    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall conduct a rulemaking 
requiring all facilities on or through which natural gas is traded on 
the spot market and the day-ahead market to impose limits on trading in 
natural gas during an emergency declared by an agency or 
instrumentality of the Federal Government, to prevent market 
distortions.

    The Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) is amended by 
inserting after section 4t the following:

``SEC. 4U. PROHIBITION ON NATURAL GAS PRICE GOUGING ON SPOT OR DAY-
              AHEAD MARKET DURING EMERGENCY.

    ``(a) In General.--If the Commission finds, after notice and 
opportunity for hearing, that, during an emergency declared by an 
agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, a person has sold 
or offered for sale, or has attempted to sell or offer for sale, in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce, on any spot or day-ahead 
market, any quantity of natural gas for a price that exceeds such 
baseline price as the Commission may establish by rule, regulation or 
order, the Commission may subject the person to a civil penalty.
    ``(b) Amount of Penalty.--The amount of a civil penalty imposed on 
a person under subsection (a) shall be not more than $1,000,000 per 
day.''.

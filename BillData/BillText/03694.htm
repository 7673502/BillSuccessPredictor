following:

                    (A) Access to COVID-19 vaccines in the United 
                States.
                    (B) Access to COVID-19 vaccines globally.
                    (C) Global COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity.
                    (D) Global supply chains of COVID-19 vaccines and 
                related technologies and the inputs needed to produce 
                those vaccines and related technologies.
                    (E) Exports and imports by the United States of 
                COVID-19 vaccines and related technologies and the 
                inputs needed to produce such vaccines and related 
                technologies.
                    (F) Biopharmaceutical product manufacturing in the

            (2) The Secretary's conclusion on whether an elimination or 
        waiver, as described in subsection (b), during the covered 
        period--
                    (A) will materially increase global COVID-19 
                vaccine access; or
                    (B) will have a negative impact on any of the 
                factors described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of 
                paragraph (1).
    (b) USTR Opposition.--The United States Trade Representative shall 
oppose an elimination or waiver of an obligation imposed on members of 
the World Trade Organization under the Agreement on Trade-Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights with respect to vaccines 
intended to prevent or mitigate COVID-19, if the Secretary concludes 
under subsection (a)(2) that such elimination or waiver--
            (1) will not materially increase global COVID-19 vaccine 
        access; or
            (2) will have a negative impact on any of the factors 
        described in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of subsection 
        (a)(1).
    (c) Covered Period Defined.--The term ``covered period'' means the

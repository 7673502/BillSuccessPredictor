United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. MONITORING OCEAN SOUNDSCAPES.

    (a) In General.--The Administrator shall maintain and expand an 
ocean soundscape development program that includes the Ocean Noise 
Reference Station Network of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and the National Park Service, using and coordinating 
with the Integrated Ocean Observing System, and may coordinate as 
appropriate with Regional Ocean Partnerships, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service, and the Department of Defense to--
            (1) provide grants to expand the deployment of Federal and 
        non-Federal observing and data management systems capable of 
        collecting measurements of underwater sound in high-priority 
        ocean and coastal locations for purposes of monitoring and 
        analyzing baselines and trends in the underwater soundscape to 
        protect and manage marine life;
            (2) continue to develop and apply standardized forms of 
        measurements to assess sounds produced by marine animals, 
        physical processes, and anthropogenic activities; and
            (3) after coordinating with the Department of Defense, 
        coordinate and make accessible to the public the datasets, 
        modeling and analysis, and user-driven products and tools,

                            (viii) creates standards for and allows 
                        ocean users to contribute data to the 
                        monitoring system using comparable near real-
                        time monitoring methods and technologies; and
                            (ix) communicates the risks of injury to 
                        large whales to ocean users in a way that is 
                        most likely to result in informed decision 
                        making regarding the mitigation of those risks.

        and with input from affected stakeholders, develop and deploy 
        mitigation protocols that make use of the near real-time 
        monitoring system to direct sector-specific mitigation measures 
        that avoid and significantly reduce risk of serious injury and 
        mortality to North Atlantic right whales.
            (5) Access to data.--

                Right Whale Sighting Advisory System and WhaleMap or 
                other successive public web portals.
                    (B) National security related information.--The

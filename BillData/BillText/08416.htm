                established under section 3;
                    (B) carry out the purposes of disaster assistance 
                programs swiftly, efficiently, equitably, and in

                privacy and data protections provided under this 
                section; and

                allocation of resources, or discrimination in the 
                administration of disaster assistance programs.
            (2) Authorities of administrator.--In establishing and 
        maintaining the electronic information sharing system under 
        this subsection, the Administrator may collect and maintain 
        disaster assistance information received from a disaster 
        assistance agency, a block grant recipient, or an applicant for 
        a disaster assistance program and share such information with 
        any other disaster assistance agency or block grant recipient 
        using such electronic information sharing system.
    (b) Data Security.--The Administrator may facilitate the collection 
of disaster assistance information into the electronic information 
sharing system established under this section only after the following 
requirements have been met:
            (1) The Administrator certifies that the electronic 
        information sharing system substantially complies with the data 
        security standards and best practices established pursuant to 
        subchapter II of chapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, 
        and any other applicable Federal information security policy.

        assistance agencies, publishes standard rules of behavior for

        collection, maintenance, sharing, and use of additional

                assistance information is collected, maintained, or

                disaster assistance program and consistent with the 
                fair information practice principles; and
                    (C) the disaster assistance agencies and block

            (2) Notice and publication requirements.--The publication 
        of a notice under paragraph (1) of a revision to the 
        DisasterAssistance.gov system of records prior to any new

        carry out the purposes of a disaster assistance program with 
        regard to a disaster declared by the President under section

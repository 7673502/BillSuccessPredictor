economically significant shall be subject to the following requirements 
(regardless of whether negotiated rulemaking occurs):
            ``(1) The Secretary shall determine whether the draft

        subsidy cost resulting from a loan modification.
            ``(2) If the Secretary determines under paragraph (1) that 
        the draft regulation would result in an increase in a subsidy

        take no further action with respect to such regulation.
    ``(b) Proposed or Final Regulations and Executive Actions.--
Beginning after the date of enactment of this section, the Secretary

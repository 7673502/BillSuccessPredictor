                                 A BILL


 
                To improve certain criminal provisions.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as the ``Combating Violent and Dangerous 
Crime Act''.

SEC. 2. BANK ROBBERY AND RELATED CRIMES.

    Section 2113 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) by striking ``, or attempts to take,'';
                    (B) by striking ``or attempts to obtain''; and
                    (C) by inserting before ``; or'' the following: ``, 
                or attempts to do so'';
            (2) by redesignating subsections (f), (g), and (h) as 
        subsections (g), (h), and (i), respectively; and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (e) the following:
    ``(f) Whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section 
shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the 
offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.''.

SEC. 3. HOMICIDE OFFENSES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 51 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 1123. No maximum time period between act or omission and death 
              of victim
    ``A prosecution may be instituted for any homicide offense under 
the laws of the United States without regard to the time that elapsed 
between--
            ``(1) the act or omission that caused the death of the 
        victim; and
            ``(2) the death of the victim.''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of sections for chapter 51 of 
title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``1123. No maximum time period between act or omission and death of 
                            victim.''.

SEC. 4. PROTECTION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Findings.-- Congress finds the following:
            (1) Officers and employees of the United States Government 
        dutifully and faithfully serve the United States, often placing 
        themselves at serious risk of death or bodily harm, in order to 
        preserve, protect, and defend the interests of the United 
        States.
            (2) In prohibiting the assaulting, resisting, or impeding 
        of officers and employees of the United States Government, 
        Congress intended to maximize protection for Federal officers 
        and employees and ensure that individuals who kill or assault 
        Federal officers or employees are prosecuted.
            (3) The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
        Circuit analyzed section 111 of title 18, United States Code, 
        correctly when it found, ``Categorizing Sec.  111(a)(1) as a 
        general intent crime furthers the congressional objective: `If 
        a person acts in a manner which is assaultive toward a federal 
        official, without specifically intending harm or the 
        apprehension of imminent harm, the official still would be 
        impeded in the performance of his official duties.''' United 
        States v. Kimes, 246 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir. 2001), quoting 
        United States v. Jennings, 855 F. Supp. 1427, 1440 (M.D. Pa. 
        1994).
            (4) Federal courts, including the United States Courts of 
        Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, 
        and Eleventh Circuits, have correctly interpreted section 111 
        of title 18, United States Code, to be a crime of general 
        intent rather than a crime of specific intent.
            (5) Other Federal courts, including the United States 
        Courts of Appeals for the First, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits, 
        have issued decisions with language arguably suggesting that 
        section 111 of title 18, United States Code, is a crime of 
        specific intent rather than a crime of general intent, creating 
        the appearance of a split among the United States courts of 
        appeals.
            (6) In light of the appearance of a split among the United 
        States courts of appeals described in paragraph (5), it has 
        become necessary for Congress to clarify its original intent 
        that section 111 of title 18, United States Code, is a crime of 
        general intent.
    (b) Amendment.--Section 111 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) Knowledge of Defendant.--In a prosecution for an offense 
under subsection (a), the Government need not prove that the 
defendant--
            ``(1) knew that the victim of the offense was a person 
        designated in section 1114 or performed official duties during 
        service as a person so designated; or
            ``(2) acted with any intent greater than knowledge.''.

SEC. 5. MOTOR VEHICLES.

    Section 2119 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)--
                    (A) by striking ``, with the intent to cause death 
                or serious bodily harm'';
                    (B) by inserting a comma after ``force and 
                violence''; and
                    (C) by inserting ``or conspires'' after 
                ``attempts'';
            (2) in paragraph (1), by striking ``15 years'' and 
        inserting ``20 years'';
            (3) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs 
        (3) and (4), respectively;
            (4) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:
            ``(2) if a dangerous weapon or device is used in 
        committing, or in attempting to commit, the offense, be fined 
        under this title or imprisoned not more than 25 years, or 
        both,''; and
            (5) in paragraph (3), as so redesignated, by striking ``25 
        years'' and inserting ``40 years''.

SEC. 6. PENALTIES FOR FIREARMS OFFENSES.

    Section 924(c)(3)(B) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(B) is a conspiracy, or an attempt, to commit an offense 
        that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened 
        use of physical force against the person or property of 
        another.''.

              MANUFACTURED OR DISTRIBUTED FOR MINORS.

    (a) In General.--Part D of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.

    ``Sec. 418a.  (a) Except as provided in subsection (c) and in

                    ``(A) combined with a candy or beverage product;
                    ``(B) marketed or packaged to appear similar to a 
                candy or beverage product; or
                    ``(C) modified by flavoring or coloring to appear 
                similar to a candy or beverage product; and
            ``(2) knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that

    ``(b) The penalty described in this subsection is--

        involving the same controlled substance and schedule, an 
        additional term of imprisonment of not more than 20 years.
    ``(c) Subsection (a) shall not apply to any controlled substance

            ``(1) has been approved by the Secretary under section 505 
        of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355), if 
        the contents, marketing, and packaging of the controlled 
        substance have not been altered from the form approved by the 
        Secretary; or
            ``(2) has been altered at the direction of a practitioner 
        who is acting for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual

    (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of contents for

        reasonably demonstrated that the exemption is needed to provide 
        disaster relief to Puerto Rico for areas affected by Hurricane 
        Fiona.
            (2) Process.--
                    (A) Request.--An owner or operator of a vessel may

                    (B) Public denial statement.--In any case where the 
                Secretary denies an exemption request under 
                subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall promptly provide 
                a public, detailed statement regarding the reasoning 
                and analysis for the denial.
                    (C) Deemed approval.--If the Secretary does not 
                approve or deny a request according to the terms of 
                subparagraph (A), the request shall be deemed to be 
                approved.
    (b) Period of Exemption.--An exemption approved under subsection 
(a) shall be valid until the earlier of--
            (1) the date that is 1 year after the date on which the 
        exemption was approved; or
            (2) the date on which the major disaster declared by the 
        President under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
        Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121) on 
        September 22, 2022 expires.

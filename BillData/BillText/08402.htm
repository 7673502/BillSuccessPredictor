    To amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to prohibit the 
    Secretary of Energy from prescribing any new or amended energy 
    conservation standard for a product that is not technologically 
      feasible and economically justified, and for other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``DOE Appliance and Equipment 
Standards Reform and Consumer Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. PRESCRIBING NEW OR AMENDED ENERGY CONSERVATION STANDARDS.

    (a) Petition for Amended Standard.--Section 325(n) of the Energy 
Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(n)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``or revoked'' after 
        ``should be amended'';
            (2) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:
            ``(2) The Secretary shall grant a petition to determine if 
        energy conservation standards for a covered product should be 
        amended or revoked if the Secretary finds that such petition 
        contains evidence, assuming no other evidence were considered, 
        that such standards--
                    ``(A) result in additional costs to consumers;
                    ``(B) do not result in significant conservation of 
                energy or water;
                    ``(C) are not technologically feasible; and
                    ``(D) result in such covered product not being 
                commercially available in the United States to all 
                consumers.''; and
            (3) in paragraph (4)--
                    (A) by striking ``New or amended standards.'' and 
                inserting ``New, amended, or revoked standards.'';
                    (B) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as 
                clauses (i) and (ii), respectively;
                    (C) by striking ``Not later than 3 years'' and 
                inserting ``(A) Not later than 3 years''; and
                    (D) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(B) Not later than 180 days after the date of granting a 
        petition to revoke standards, the Secretary shall publish in 
        the Federal Register--
                    ``(i) a final rule revoking the standards; or
                    ``(ii) a determination that it is not necessary to 
                revoke the standards.
            ``(C) The grant of a petition by the Secretary under this 
        subsection creates no presumption with respect to the 
        Secretary's determination of any of the criteria in a 
        rulemaking under this section.''.
    (b) Criteria.--Paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 325(o) of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(o)) are amended to 
read as follows:
            ``(2) Requirements.--
                    ``(A) Design.--Any new or amended energy 
                conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under 
                this section for any type (or class) of covered product 
                shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in 
                energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, 
                faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, 
                which the Secretary determines is technologically 
                feasible and economically justified.
                    ``(B) Test procedures.--The Secretary may not 
                prescribe a new or amended energy conservation standard 
                under this section for a type (or class) of covered 
                product if a test procedure has not been prescribed 
                pursuant to section 323 with respect to that type (or 
                class) of product.

                not prescribe a new or amended energy conservation 
                standard under this section for a type (or class) of 
                covered product if the Secretary determines that the 
                establishment and imposition of such energy 
                conservation standard will not result in significant 
                conservation of--

                        class) of covered product unless the Secretary 
                        determines that the establishment and 
                        imposition of such energy conservation standard 
                        is technologically feasible and economically 
                        justified.

                        327, a determination under clause (i) with 
                        respect to any type (or class) of covered 
                        products shall have the same effect as would a

                Secretary shall conduct a quantitative economic impact 
                analysis of imposition of the energy conservation

To take certain actions with respect to Saudi Arabia in response to the 
 shootings that occurred at Naval Air Station Pensacola in Florida on 
                           December 6, 2019.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Saudi Arabia December 6, 2019, Anti-
Terror and Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Trust between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the 
        United States has been eroded by the devastating humanitarian 
        costs of the war in Yemen, the kidnappings and shakedowns of 
        royals and other businessmen in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton, the 
        murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the torture of women 
        activists seeking equal rights.
            (2) Fifteen of the September 11, 2001, attackers were Saudi 
        citizens, nationals, or of Saudi descent and some of these 
        individuals had direct assistance from the Saudi Government for 
        training, logistical support, and radicalization.
            (3) Mohammed Alshamrani, a 21-year-old second lieutenant in 
        the Royal Saudi Air Force who was radicalized by al-Qa`ida in 
        the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Osama bin Laden's teachings of 
        Wahhabiism, fatally shot Cameron Walters, 21, Mohammed Sameh 
        Haitham, 19, Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, and wounded eight others, 
        including two sheriff's deputies, at Naval Air Station 
        Pensacola in Florida on December 6, 2019, in an act of 
        unprovoked and cowardly terror.
            (4) Al-Shamrani was a Trojan Horse sent by his country, 
        Saudi Arabia, and the Saudi authorities were negligent in 
        properly screening Al-Shamrani.
            (5) The Saudi Government had an obligation to report Al-
        Shamrani's anti-American social media posts prior to his 
        enrolment in a joint military training program at Naval Air 
        Station Pensacola.
            (6) The Saudi Government was derelict in monitoring and 
        reporting Al-Shamrani's radicalization, and on failed in their 
        promise to compensate the victims of Al-Shamrani's terrorist 
        attack.

Defense or any other Federal agency may be used to--

            (2) carry out any military officer exchange programs with 
        Saudi Arabia.
    (b) Export Controls.--Notwithstanding the Export Control Reform Act

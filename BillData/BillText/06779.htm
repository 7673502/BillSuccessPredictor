                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to reduce the 
 vulnerability of the electric grid to physical attack, cyber attack, 
 and other events, including by ensuring that large power transformers 
and other critical electric grid equipment are strategically located to 
 ensure timely replacement of such equipment as may be necessary, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Grid Resilience and Infrastructure 
Depot Act of 2022'' or the ``GRID Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. STRATEGIC TRANSFORMER RESERVE AND RESILIENCE PROGRAM.

    (a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a program to 
reduce the vulnerability of the electric grid to physical attack, cyber 
attack, electromagnetic pulse, geomagnetic disturbances, severe 
weather, climate change, and seismic events, including by--
            (1) ensuring that large power transformers, generator step-
        up transformers, power conversion equipment, and other critical 
        electric grid equipment are strategically located to ensure 
        timely replacement of such equipment as may be necessary to 
        restore electric grid function rapidly in the event of severe 
        damage to the electric grid due to physical attack, cyber 
        attack, electromagnetic pulse, geomagnetic disturbances, severe 
        weather, climate change, or seismic events; and
            (2) establishing a coordinated plan to facilitate 
        transportation of large power transformers, generator step-up 
        transformers, power conversion equipment, and other critical 
        electric grid equipment.
    (b) Transformer Resilience.--In carrying out the program 
established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall--
            (1) improve large power transformers, generator step-up 
        transformers, power conversion equipment, and other critical 
        electric grid equipment by reducing their vulnerabilities;
            (2) develop, test, and deploy innovative equipment designs 
        that are more flexible and offer greater resiliency of electric 
        grid functions;
            (3) coordinate with industry and manufacturers to 
        standardize large power transformers, generator step-up 
        transformers, power conversion equipment, and other critical 
        electric grid equipment;
            (4) monitor and test large power transformers, generator 
        step-up transformers, power conversion equipment, and other 
        critical electric grid equipment that the Secretary determines 
        may pose a risk to the bulk-power system or national security; 
        and
            (5) facilitate the domestic manufacturing of large power 
        transformers, generator step-up transformers, power conversion 
        equipment, and other critical electric grid equipment through 
        the issuance of grants and loans, and through the provision of 
        technical support.
    (c) Strategic Equipment Reserves.--
            (1) Authorization.--In carrying out the program established 
        under subsection (a), the Secretary may establish one or more 
        federally owned strategic equipment reserves, as appropriate, 
        to ensure nationwide access to large power transformers, 
        generator step-up transformers, power conversion equipment, and 
        other critical electric grid equipment.
            (2) Consideration.--In establishing any federally owned 
        strategic equipment reserve, the Secretary may consider 
        existing spare transformer and equipment programs and 
        requirements established by the private sector, Regional 
        Transmission Organizations, Independent System Operators, and 
        State regulatory authorities.
            (3) Iron and steel.--
                    (A) In general.--In establishing any federally 
                owned strategic equipment reserve, no Federal funds 
                shall be used for the purchase of large power 
                transformers, generator step-up transformers, power 
                conversion equipment, or other critical electric grid 
                equipment unless all of the iron and steel products 
                used in such equipment are produced in the United 
                States.
                    (B) Waiver.--
                            (i) In general.--The Secretary shall waive 
                        application of subparagraph (A) in any case or 
                        category of cases in which the Secretary finds 
                        that--
                                    (I) applying subparagraph (A) would 
                                be inconsistent with the public 
                                interest;
                                    (II) iron and steel products are 
                                not produced in the United States in 
                                sufficient and reasonably available 
                                quantities or of a satisfactory 
                                quality; or
                                    (III) inclusion of iron and steel 
                                products produced in the United States 
                                will increase the cost of the 
                                applicable large power transformers, 
                                generator step-up transformers, power 
                                conversion equipment, or other critical 
                                electric grid equipment by more than 25 
                                percent.
                            (ii) Process.--Before issuing a waiver

                                determination to issue the waiver; and
                                    (II) provide a period of not less 
                                than 15 days for public comment on the

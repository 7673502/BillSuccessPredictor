      To require any entity established to develop congressional 
   redistricting plans for a State to hold public hearings at which 
     individuals who are members of communities of interest have a 
meaningful opportunity to express their views on proposed redistricting 
                     plans, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. REQUIRING ENTITIES ESTABLISHED TO DEVELOP CONGRESSIONAL 
              REDISTRICTING PLANS TO HOLD PUBLIC HEARINGS.

    (a) Requirement.--Any entity other than the legislature of a State, 
including an independent redistricting commission, a special master 
appointed by a Federal or State court, or a Federal or State court, 
which develops a congressional redistricting plan for a State shall--
            (1) hold multiple public hearings prior to the development 
        of a final plan;
            (2) ensure that individuals may attend such hearings 
        virtually;
            (3) hold such hearings in locations which are within a 
        reasonable distance of the locations of communities of 
        interest; and
            (4) ensure that members of communities of interest have 
        meaningful opportunities to express their views on any of the 
        entity's plans.
    (b) Treatment of Political Subdivisions as Communities of 
Interest.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``communities of 
interest'' may, in certain circumstances, include political 
subdivisions such as counties, municipalities, tribal lands and 
reservations, or school districts, but shall not include common 
relationships with political parties or political candidates.
    (c) Enforcement.--
            (1) Action by attorney general.--The Attorney General may 
        bring a civil action in an appropriate district court for such 
        declaratory or injunctive relief as is necessary to carry out 
        this Act.
            (2) Private right of action.--A person who is aggrieved by 
        a violation of this Act may bring a civil action in an 
        appropriate district court for such declaratory or injunctive 
        relief as may be appropriate with respect to the violation.
    (d) Effective Date.--This Act shall apply with respect to 
redistricting carried out pursuant to the decennial census conducted 
during 2030 or any succeeding decennial census.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

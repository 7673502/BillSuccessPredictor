 To direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and 
 Information to establish a competitive grant program to assist local 
 governments in providing efficient review and approval of zoning and 
  permitting applications that facilitate the deployment of broadband 
                infrastructure, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Broadband Incentives for Communities 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Congress has provided $12,000,000,000 since 2010 in 
        competitive grants and financial assistance to expand broadband 
        connections to unserved rural and underserved low-income 
        communities.
            (2) Local governments play a significant role in the 
        deployment of broadband infrastructure through their zoning and 
        permitting processes.
            (3) Local governments will need additional assistance to 
        manage the expected accelerated pace of zoning and permitting 
        applications that facilitate the deployment of broadband 
        infrastructure in their communities.
            (4) The Federal Government has a critical role to play in 
        encouraging the deployment of broadband infrastructure by local 
        governments.
            (5) The establishment of a competitive grant program to 
        provide resources to, and incentives for, local governments to 
        fulfill their role in expanding broadband access for all is a 
        vital component of a successful broadband deployment policy.

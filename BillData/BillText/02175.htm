                                 A BILL


 
To prohibit certain heads of Federal agencies and Administrations from 
imposing a mask requirement on certain domestic transportation, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No Mask Mandate for Kids Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON MASK REQUIREMENT ON CERTAIN DOMESTIC MODES OF 
              TRANSPORTATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) There has been no reasonable scientific backing to 
        support the Federal requirement that children wear masks.
            (2) Any directives regarding the wearing of masks should be 
        decided by industries, States, and localities.
    (b) Restriction.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 
Secretary of Transportation (including through the Administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration), the Secretary of Homeland Security 
(including through the Administrator of the Transportation Security 
Administration and the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard), 
and the heads of any other executive departments and agencies that have 
relevant regulatory authority may not impose any requirement for masks 
to be worn in or on--
            (1) airports;
            (2) commercial aircraft;
            (3) trains;
            (4) public maritime vessels, including ferries;
            (5) intercity bus services; and
            (6) all forms of public transportation (as such term is 
        defined in section 5302 of title 49, United States Code).
                                 &lt;all&gt;

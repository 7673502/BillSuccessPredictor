                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibition on Imports of Russian 
Oil Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF RUSSIAN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS.

    (a) Prohibition.--The President shall prohibit the importation of 
all petroleum products (as such term is defined in section 3 of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6202)) originating from 
Russia into the customs territory of the United States (as such term is 
defined in General Note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule).
    (b) Relaxation of Prohibition.--The President may modify or remove 
the prohibition under subsection (a) with respect to some or all 
petroleum products described in such subsection if the President 
notifies the appropriate congressional committees that, in the 
determination of the President, such modification or removal is 
appropriate given the situation in Ukraine, and includes with such 
notification--
            (1) an explanation of the rationale for such modification 
        or removal; and
            (2) if the modification does not result in the full removal 
        of the prohibition, a description of the criteria to be met by 
        Russia for further modification or removal of remaining 
        elements of the prohibition.
    (c) Penalties.--The President is authorized to use appropriate 
authorities to impose such civil or criminal penalties as may be 
necessary to enforce the prohibition under subsection (a).
    (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees.--For purposes of this 
section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--
            (1) the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the 
        President Pro Tempore of the Senate;
            (2) the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee 
        on Energy and Commerce, and the Permanent Select Committee on 
        Intelligence of the House of Representatives; and
            (3) the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations, the Committee on Armed Services, the 
        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and the Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.

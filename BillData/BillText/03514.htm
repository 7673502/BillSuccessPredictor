    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SEC. 3. REPORT BY COMPTROLLER GENERAL.

    Not later than the date that is 3 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, and annually thereafter for each of the following 5 years, 
the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a 
report containing the following information:
            (1) The percentage of incarcerated individuals that receive 
        medical assistance under a State plan under title XIX of the 
        Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).
            (2) The access of incarcerated individuals to health care 
        services, including specialty care, and health care providers.
            (3) The quality of health care services provided to 
        incarcerated individuals.
            (4) Any impact of coverage under such a State plan on 
        recidivism.
            (5) The percentage of incarcerated individuals who, upon

                    (A) enrolled under such a State plan; and
                    (B) connected to a primary care provider in their 
                community.
            (6) Trends in the prevalence and incidence of illness and

        individuals.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON INCARCERATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH 
              SERVICES.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) no individual in the United States should be 
        incarcerated for the purpose of being provided with health care 
        that is unavailable to the individual in the individual's 
        community;
            (2) each State and unit of local government should 
        establish programs that offer community-based health services 
        (including mental health and substance use disorder services) 
        commensurate with the principle stated in paragraph (1); and
            (3) Federal reimbursement for expenditures on medical 
        assistance made available through the amendments made by this 
        Act should not supplant an investment in community-based 
        services.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

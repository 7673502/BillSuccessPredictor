                                 A BILL


 
    To prohibit the construction of any new Federal building in the 
                         District of Columbia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Wasting All our Money on 
Palaces Act'' or the ``SWAMP Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The debt of the United States is over 28 trillion 
        dollars and continues to rise.
            (2) The continued increase in our debt could cause our debt 
        to be downgraded increasing the cost of borrowing money and 
        bankrupting our country.
            (3) Congress must tighten its fiscal belt to ease the 
        burden of the increasing debt level on United States taxpayers.
            (4) The Federal Government has a responsibility to the 
        taxpayers to make sacrifices in other areas.
            (5) Federal funds that otherwise would be spent on new 
        construction or leasing of Federal buildings would be better 
        spent helping the people of the United States by paying down 
        the Nation's debt.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON CONSTRUCTION NEW FEDERAL BUILDINGS.

    (a) In General.--For a 2-year period beginning on the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of General Services and any 
other executive of a Federal Department or Agency may not agree or sign 
a contract to construct a new Federal building in the District of 
Columbia.
    (b) Definition of Federal Building.--For purposes of this section, 
the term ``Federal building'' means any building to be constructed by, 
or for the use of, any Federal agency. Such term shall include 
buildings built for the purpose of being leased by a Federal agency.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Public Lands and 
Waters Climate Leadership Act of 2022''.
    (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act is the 
following:

Sec. 1. Short title and table of contents.
Sec. 2. Public lands and waters energy and climate policy.
Sec. 3. Alignment of Federal fossil fuel development with climate 
                            change targets.

SEC. 2. PUBLIC LANDS AND WATERS ENERGY AND CLIMATE POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States that--
            (1) the United States should aggressively reduce greenhouse 
        gas emissions to achieve the Biden administration's climate 
        change commitments which align with the Intergovernmental Panel 
        on Climate Change (IPCC) pathway for a 66-percent chance of 
        avoiding 1.5 degrees Celsius warming, and should harness the 
        full potential of America's public lands and waters to help 
        deliver on these critical emission reduction goals;
            (2) public lands should be managed to rapidly reduce 
        greenhouse gas emissions and co-pollutant emissions and to 
        respond to unavoidable impacts of climate change through 
        increased resilience of ecosystems and wildlife habitats;
            (3) the protection of ocean ecosystems is vital to 
        promoting ocean health and increasing resilience to climate 
        change, and conservation of United States marine resources is 
        one of the best ways to remove carbon dioxide from the 
        atmosphere;
            (4) energy development and production decisions on public 
        lands and oceans should be guided by the goals of--
                    (A) protecting human well-being, biodiversity, and 
                the environment for present and future generations;
                    (B) avoiding the most harmful impacts of climate 
                change;
                    (C) promoting a rapid, sustainable, just, and 
                equitable transition to a clean energy economy; and
                    (D) preserving natural carbon storage sinks;
            (5) Tribal nations and environmental justice communities 
        are more vulnerable to the direct and indirect effects of 
        emissions from public lands and oceans and often have the least 
        resources to respond; thus, they should be meaningfully engaged 
        in government decision making as our Nation reduces emissions 
        from public lands and oceans and builds its climate resilience 
        against the effects of those emissions;
            (6) achieving 2030, 2035, and 2050 United States greenhouse 
        gas emissions reduction targets established by the Biden 
        administration are critical to prevent the worst impacts of 
        climate change from occurring; and
            (7) the Secretary of the Interior holds existing expansive 
        legal authority to reduce or eliminate fossil fuel leasing and 
        production, and otherwise reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 
        public lands and waters and address climate change, including 
        Article IV, section 3, clause 2 or the Constitution (commonly 
        referred to as the ``property clause''), the Mineral Leasing 
        Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, and the Federal 
        Land Policy and Management Act of 1976.

SEC. 3. ALIGNMENT OF FEDERAL FOSSIL FUEL DEVELOPMENT WITH CLIMATE 
              CHANGE TARGETS.

    The Secretary--
            (1) shall manage public lands and waters to minimize and 
        mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change; 
        and
            (2) may not hold new lease sales for coal, oil, natural 
        gas, oil shale, or tar sands, or approve new fossil fuel 
        permits or infrastructure, until the Secretary, in coordination 
        with the Chief, develops and releases, in accordance with all 
        applicable laws, a public report and action plan, as required 
        under section 4, that ensures that lifecycle greenhouse gas 
        emissions from any new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on 
        public lands and waters is consistent with--
                    (A) reducing net United States greenhouse gas 
                emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030;
                    (B) achieving 100 percent carbon-free United States 
                electricity by 2035; and
                    (C) achieving net-zero emissions from the entire

SEC. 5. CLIMATE TEST SCREENING TOOL AND CONDITIONS.

    (a) In General.--If the Secretary determines that fossil fuel 
leasing or permitting can resume on public lands and waters, pursuant 
to section 4(b), any such activity shall first be subjected to a 
climate screening policy before approval in order to test whether the 
proposal is individually consistent with the most recent Emissions 
Reduction Strategy and the conditions underlying the Secretary's 
determination in that Emissions Reduction Strategy. Conditions the 
Secretary must consider in a climate screening tool include, at a 
minimum--
            (1) whether the mass of lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 
        associated with any proposed leasing action, including lease 
        sales and the issuance of resource management plans, is 
        consistent with defined pathways for meeting climate targets; 
        and
            (2) whether production pursuant to such leasing action 
        would remain economically viable in a market that presumes that 
        climate targets in section 3 will be met.
    (b) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after of the enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall adopt regulations establishing a climate 
test screening tool that describes the process and framework for 
carrying out the climate screening policy established in subsection 
(a).
    (c) Required Rejection Criteria.--The Secretary shall reject any 
proposed fossil fuel leasing or permitting action that does not satisfy 
the assessment set out in subsection (a).

SEC. 6. ONLINE PUBLICATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary shall make freely available on a 
public website, with respect to the previous year--
            (1) information that describes for each fossil fuel 
        operation that is subject to the mineral leasing laws or title 
        III or V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 
        regardless of size, including production, storage, gathering, 
        processing, transportation, and handling operations--
                    (A) the aggregate amount of each fossil fuel, by 
                type and by State, produced on Federal leases; and
                    (B) for gas reported, the portion and source of 
                such amount that was released or disposed of by each of 
                venting, flaring, and fugitive release; and
            (2) information that describes the amount and sources of 
        energy, in delivered megawatt hours, produced from operating 
        solar, wind, and geothermal projects on public lands under 
        lease for the production of renewable energy.
    (b) Format.--Information made available under this section shall be 
presented in a format that translates such amounts and portions into 
emissions of metric tons of greenhouse gases expressed in carbon 
dioxide equivalent using both the 20-year and 100-year Global Warming 
Potential-weighted emission values.
    (c) Data Publication Frequency.--The data made available under this 
section shall be updated at least annually.

SEC. 7. ACCOUNTING FOR CARBON POLLUTION IN FOSSIL FUEL FISCAL TERMS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall reform fossil fuel fiscal 
terms to--
            (1) account for damages to the climate resulting from 
        Federal fossil fuel production; and
            (2) ensure that fiscal terms under the Department of the 
        Interior's jurisdiction are consistent with the most recent 
        Emissions Reduction Strategy.
    (b) Terms.--Fiscal terms shall include collecting annual, 
nonrefundable severance fees on fossil fuels produced from new leases 
on public lands.
    (c) Use of Revenues.--Revenues from the severance fees established 
under subsection (b) shall be used by the Secretary to financially 
support States that use revenues from Federal fossil fuel leasing and 
production if such government uses such revenues to diversify their 
economies to reduce their reliance on coal, oil, and gas.

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To amend title 31, United States Code, to ensure the United States 
  currency market does not support egregious human rights violations.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Atrocities through 
Currency Accountability Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States dollar composes nearly two-thirds of 
        the world's currency reserves, with more than one trillion 
        dollars being owned by the Government of China as of October 
        2020.
            (2) It is the policy of the United States to advance 
        freedom and human rights globally, a policy that is 
        incompatible with egregious human rights violations, and as 
        such has a responsibility to ensure that the United States 
        currency market does not complicitly support perpetrators of 
        these abuses.
            (3) In regions of the world where political, governmental, 
        or other realities preclude humanitarian due diligence 
        practices from ensuring the currency market of the United 
        States is not interwoven with entities' egregious human rights 
        violations, additional measures must be taken to separate the 
        economy of the United States from these violations, as well as 
        to apply pressure on relevant actors to uphold their 
        humanitarian responsibilities.

SEC. 3. SPECIAL MEASURES FOR JURISDICTIONS, FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, OR 
              INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS OF PRIMARY HUMANITARIAN 
              CONCERN.

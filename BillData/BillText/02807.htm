    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Responsible and Effective 
Virtual Experiences through Novel Technology to Deliver Improved Access 
and Better Engagement with Tested and Evidence-based Strategies Act'' 
or the ``PREVENT DIABETES Act''.

SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF VIRTUAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM SUPPLIERS IN 
              MDPP EXPANDED MODEL.

    (a) In General.--Not later than January 1, 2022, the Secretary 
shall revise the regulations under part 410 and section 424.200-.518 of 
title 42, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulations), 
to permit any diabetes prevention lifestyle change program, including 
any online or virtual diabetes prevention program, that has met the 
standards for full recognition by the CDC--
            (1) to apply to be a MDPP supplier; and
            (2) upon a successful application, to participate in the 
        MDPP Expanded Model described in the final rule published in 
        the Federal Register on November 15, 2017, entitled ``Medicare 
        Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee 
        Schedule and Other Revisions to Part B for CY 2018; Medicare 
        Shared Savings Program Requirements; and Medicare Diabetes 
        Prevention Program'', in accordance with this section.
    (b) Virtual Diabetes Prevention Program Suppliers.--A virtual 
diabetes prevention program supplier participating in the MDPP Expanded 
Model shall be subject to the same standards as in-person MDPP 
suppliers participating in such program, except--
            (1) the administrative location of a virtual diabetes 
        prevention program supplier shall be the address of the 
        supplier on file under the Diabetes Prevention Recognition 
        Program of the CDC;
            (2) a virtual diabetes prevention program supplier shall 
        not be required to report a change in its administrative 
        location except when such supplier's address on file under the 
        Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program has changed; and
            (3) a virtual diabetes prevention program supplier shall 
        not be prohibited from submitting or receiving payment for a 
        claim for virtual diabetes prevention program services because 
        the beneficiary was not present in the same State or country as 
        such supplier or service.
    (c) Diabetes Prevention Program Supplier Screening Level.--The 
supplier enrollment screening level applicable to a virtual diabetes 
prevention program supplier shall be at a ``high'' categorical risk in 
accordance with section 424.518(c)(2) of title 42, Code of Federal 
Regulations (or any successor regulations).
    (d) Clarification.--Notwithstanding any provision of this law, the 
MDPP Expanded Model, upon the inclusion of virtual diabetes prevention 
program suppliers, shall continue to be an expanded model under section 
1115A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a), unless the 
Secretary determines, based on performance data from the MDPP Expanded 
Model, that continued testing would be inconsistent with the 
requirements set forth in subsection (c) of such section 1115A.
    (e) Other Testing.--Nothing in this section shall limit the 
Secretary from developing and testing additional models that utilize 
virtual technology or deliver health care services through virtual 
means.

            (1) CDC.--The term ``CDC'' means the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention.

        of Health and Human Services.
            (4) Virtual diabetes prevention program supplier.--The term 
        ``virtual diabetes prevention program supplier'' means a 
        supplier, that meets the standards for full recognition by the 
        CDC, of diabetes prevention program services that are delivered

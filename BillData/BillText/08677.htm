SEC. 2. GRANTS TO DEVELOP SMALL-HOUSE NURSING FACILITIES.

    (a) Establishment.--For the purpose described in subsection (b), 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to 
as the ``Secretary''), acting through the Administrator of the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and in coordination with State health 
departments, shall establish a grant program to award grants to nursing 
facilities to convert traditional nursing facilities to small-house 
nursing facilities.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the grant program under subsection (a) 
shall be to replace beds used for long-term care in nursing facilities 
with beds used for long-term care in small-house nursing facilities, 
including by--
            (1) increasing the total number of such beds available in 
        small-house nursing facilities as of the date of enactment of 
        this Act by 250,000 by January 1, 2028; and
            (2) with respect to each State in which a nursing facility 
        that receives a grant under this Act is located, increasing the 
        number of--
                    (A) small-house nursing facilities in operation in 
                the State by not fewer than five sites; and
                    (B) beds available at such nursing facilities in 
                the State by not fewer than 250.
    (c) Use of Funds.--A nursing facility receiving a grant under this 
section shall use the grant--
            (1) exclusively for converting traditional nursing 
        facilities to small-house nursing facilities; and
            (2) not for operation of the converted facilities.
    (d) Requirements.--As a condition on receipt of a grant under this 
section, a nursing facility shall agree to each of the following:
            (1) Consultation in planning and design process.--The 
        nursing facility will consult with residents, families, a long-
        term care ombudsman, direct care nursing home workers, and a 
        certified medical director from the American Board of Post-
        Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine as part of--
                    (A) the planning and design process for converting 
                traditional nursing facilities to small-house nursing 
                facilities pursuant to the grant; and
                    (B) obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals 
                for such facilities.
            (2) Person-centered care.--
                    (A) In general.--Sites that receive funding shall 
                agree to demonstrate person-centered care upon 
                completion of construction. Person-centered care should 
                be measured prior to starting construction, 3 months 
                following move-in at the new small-house nursing 
                facilities, and annually thereafter for 5 years.
                    (B) Measurement.--The measurement described in 
                subparagraph (A) shall be done through a partnership 
                established between each site awarded the funding, a 
                quality improvement organization, the Department of 
                Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector 
                General, and the Department of Housing and Urban 
                Development. The quality improvement organization may 
                be a Quality Innovation Network/Quality Improvement 
                Organization (QIN/QIO). Quality improvement 
                organizations should provide technical assistance for 
                nursing home sites and advise sites in their continuous 
                quality improvement efforts.
                    (C) Practices.--Person-centered care shall be 
                measured via at least the following practices: food and 
                drink are available 24/7; residents are able to choose 
                when to go to bed and when to wake up; residents are 
                able to easily and regularly access outdoor spaces; 
                residents have opportunities to engage in activities 
                promoting relationship building that include different 
                ages and abilities; person-centered care training is 
                required as part of on-boarding for new staff and is 
                required as part of continuing education for all staff; 
                residents have opportunities for spontaneous and 
                meaningful enjoyment of simple daily pleasures; there 
                is consistent assignment of staff to residents; and 
                staff learn about residents' interests, memberships, 
                and relationships, and provide opportunities to 
                continue these.
                    (D) Eligibility.--If person-centered care 
                improvement is not demonstrated within 2 years upon 
                completion of construction, nursing facilities that 
                received project funding will not be eligible for the 
                next round of these Federal grant funds. If person-
                centered quality falls more than 10 percent from year 2 
                to year 5, nursing facilities that received project 
                funding will not be eligible for the next round of 
                these Federal grant funds.
            (3) Minimum of 20 years of operation.--The nursing facility 
        will provide for operation of the small-house nursing 
        facilities funded pursuant to the grant for a period of not 
        less than 20 years.
    (e) Priority.--
            (1) In general.--In carrying out subsection (a), the 
        Secretary shall give priority to a nursing facility based on a 
        demonstration of financial need.
            (2) Considerations.--In assessing the financial need of a 
        nursing facility or purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary 
        shall consider--
                    (A) the ability of the parent company of the 
                nursing facility to provide resources for converting 
                traditional nursing facilities to small-house nursing 
                facilities;
                    (B) the percentage of such facility's residents who 
                are receiving medical assistance under title XIX of the 
                Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) for care 
                provided at such facility; and
                    (C) the track record of the nursing facility and 
                its parent company in providing high-quality care.
    (f) Application.--To seek a grant under this section, a nursing 
facility shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in 
such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may 
require, including funding available for construction.

        grant under this section, a nursing facility shall agree to 
        submit to the Secretary an annual report on the activities 
        conducted through the grant, including--
                    (A) a breakdown of how and when the grant funds 
                were used; and
                    (B) with respect to each resident at such facility, 
                any difference in--
                            (i) quality of care; and
                            (ii) quality of life.
            (2) GAO report.--Not later than June 1, 2028, the 
        Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to 
        Congress a report on the grant program under this section, 
        including--
                    (A) a summary of the reports under paragraph (1); 
                and
                    (B) a summary comparing the quality of care and 
                quality of life among residents who are in a small-
                house nursing facility to residents in traditional

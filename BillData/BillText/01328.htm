Federal entity unless that vehicle is a zero-emission vehicle.
    (b) Exemption.--The head of a Federal agency may purchase or lease 
a non-tactical passenger vehicle from a non-Federal entity that is not 
a zero-emission vehicle if the head determines that, with respect to a 
particular circumstance, using a zero-emission vehicle will not be 
technically feasible.

shall not apply with respect to purchases made and leases entered into 
before the date of the enactment of this Act.

        vehicle'' means a passenger vehicle that produces zero exhaust 
        emissions of any criteria pollutant, precursor pollutant, or 
        greenhouse gas, other than water vapor, in any mode of 
        operation or condition, as determined by the Administrator of 
        the Environmental Protection Agency.
            (2) Federal agency.--The term ``Federal Agency'' means an 
        establishment in the legislative, judicial, or executive branch

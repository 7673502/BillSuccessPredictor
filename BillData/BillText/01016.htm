                                 A BILL


 
To establish an Animal Cruelty Crimes Section within the Department of 
  Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Cruelty Enforcement Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There is a significant connection between animal 
        cruelty and violence against humans, domestic violence, child 
        abuse, sexual abuse, homicide, gang activity, drug trafficking, 
        and other crimes.
            (2) Animal fighting activity may increase the spread of 
        diseases transmitted between animals and people.
            (3) A number of Federal laws have been enacted to address 
        cruelty to animals.
            (4) Recognizing the connection between animal cruelty and 
        serious crimes the Federal Bureau of Investigation tracks 
        animal cruelty crimes.
            (5) There is bipartisan and widespread public support for 
        addressing animal cruelty.
            (6) There is a government interest in ensuring laws are 
        robustly enforced for the betterment and protection of society.
            (7) The lack of a dedicated animal crimes enforcement unit 
        within the Department of Justice has resulted in unacceptable 
        delays in prosecutions, and an overall lack of prosecution, of 
        animal crimes.
            (8) Dedicated staff and resources at the Department of 
        Justice will facilitate successful enforcement of animal 
        cruelty laws, which often have unique investigative elements, 
        by providing specialized knowledge and focus, and streamlining 
        the handling of these offenses.

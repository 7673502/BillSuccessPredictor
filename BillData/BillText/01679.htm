Agriculture from conditioning any permit, lease, or other use agreement 
on the transfer of any water right to the United States, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Western Water Security Act''.

SEC. 2. POLICY DEVELOPMENT.

    When developing any rule, policy, directive, management plan, or 
similar Federal action relating to the issuance, renewal, amendment, or 
extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, 
right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement, the Secretary--
            (1) shall--
                    (A) recognize the longstanding authority of the 
                States relating to evaluating, protecting, allocating, 
                regulating, permitting, and adjudicating water use; and
                    (B) coordinate with the States to ensure that any 
                rule, policy, directive, management plan, or similar 
                Federal action is consistent with, and imposes no 
                greater restriction or regulatory requirement, than 
                applicable State water law; and
            (2) shall not--
                    (A) assert any connection between surface and 
                groundwater that is inconsistent with such a connection 
                recognized by State water law; or
                    (B) take any action that adversely affects the 
                authority of a State in permitting the beneficial use 
                of water, adjudicating water rights, definitions 
                established by a State with respect to the term 
                ``beneficial use'', ``priority of water rights'', or 
                ``terms of use'', or any other rights or obligations of 
                a State established under State law.

SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF WATER RIGHTS.

    The Secretary shall not--
            (1) condition the issuance, renewal, amendment, or 
        extension of any permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, 
        easement, right-of-way, or other land use or occupancy 
        agreement on the transfer of any water right (including joint 
        and sole ownership) directly or indirectly to the United 
        States, or on any impairment of title or interest, in whole or 
        in part, granted or otherwise recognized under State law, by 
        Federal or State adjudication, decree, or other judgment, or 
        pursuant to any interstate water compact; or
            (2) require any water user (including any federally 
        recognized Indian Tribe) to apply for or acquire a water right 
        in the name of the United States under State law as a condition 
        of the issuance, renewal, amendment, or extension of any 
        permit, approval, license, lease, allotment, easement, right-
        of-way, or other land use or occupancy agreement.

                                 A BILL


 
 To award a Congressional Gold Medal posthumously to Dr. John Cheng, a 
            hero who died protecting others on May 15, 2022.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Dr. John Cheng lived in Laguna Niguel, California, and 
        worked as a family practice and sports medicine physician.
            (2) On May 15, 2022, Dr. Cheng was attending a reception at 
        Geneva Presbyterian Church when a gunman motivated by political 
        hatred against Taiwan entered the church and opened fire on the 
        group of parishioners.
            (3) Dr. Cheng tackled the gunman, allowing other 
        parishioners to subdue the gunman and tie him up with extension 
        cords.
            (4) Dr. Cheng was shot several times during the struggle 
        with the gunman, and he died from the injuries he sustained.
            (5) The heroic actions of Dr. Cheng saved the lives of up 
        to 40 parishioners and were the final acts of service for a man 
        who devoted his life to helping others as a doctor and 
        volunteer in his community.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

    (a) Presentation Authorization.--The Speaker of the House of 
Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate arrangements for the posthumous presentation, on behalf of 
the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design to Dr. John Cheng, 
a hero who died protecting others on May 15, 2022.
    (b) Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to 
in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this Act 
referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with 
suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the 
Secretary.
    (c) Disposition of Medal.--After the presentation described under 
subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to Dr. John Cheng's wife.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
United States Mint should expedite production of the gold medal under 
this Act, so that the sacrifice of Dr. Cheng can be recognized and 
honored in a timely manner.

SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.

    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold 
medal struck pursuant to section 2 under such regulations as the 
Secretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost 
thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.

    Medals struck pursuant to this Act are national medals for the 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code.

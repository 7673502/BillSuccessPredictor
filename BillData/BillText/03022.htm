SECTION 1. REDBANK AND FANCHER CREEKS, CALIFORNIA.

    (a) In General.--The project for flood control, Redbank and Fancher 
Creeks, California, authorized by section 401(a) of the Water Resources 
Development Act of 1986 (100 Stat. 4112), is modified to authorize the 
Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to allow 
a non-Federal interest to establish conservation pools in the Big Dry 
Creek Reservoir and Fancher Creek Reservoir.
    (b) Study and Plan.--
            (1) In general.--A non-Federal interest that intends to 
        establish a conservation pool pursuant to subsection (a) 
        shall--
                    (A) perform any dam safety study that the Secretary 
                determines appropriate to determine whether the 
                establishment of such conservation pool will affect the 
                flood protections of the project described in 
                subsection (a) or be injurious to the public; and
                    (B) submit to the Secretary a plan for the 
                establishment and engineering of such conservation pool 
                that will not affect the flood protections of the 
                project or be injurious to the public.
            (2) Review.--The Secretary may accept and expend funds 
        provided by a non-Federal interest to review any study, 
        engineering, or plan submitted under this Act to ensure that 
        such study, engineering, or plan complies with Federal 
        standards.
    (c) Non-Federal Share.--The non-Federal share of the costs to study 
and modify the project described in subsection (a) to include 
conservation pools shall be 90 percent.

to revise the water control manual for the project for flood control, 
Redbank and Fancher Creeks, California, as necessary to meet the 
requirements of this section.

                                the individual's behalf.
                            (iii) A response to a standardized form (as 
                        issued by the Commission) specifying the types 
                        of information the data broker collects or 
                        obtains and the sources from which the data 
                        broker obtains data.
                            (iv) A statement as to whether the data

                            (vi) Any other information determined 
                        appropriate by the Commission.

                    (A) In general.--The Commission shall make the 
                information described in paragraph (1) publicly 
                available in a downloadable and machine-readable 
                format, except in the event that the Commission--
                            (i) determines that the risk of making such 
                        information available is not in the interest of 
                        public safety or welfare; and
                            (ii) provides a justification for such 
                        determination.
                    (B) Disclaimer.--The Commission shall include on

                        accuracy of the responses provided by the data 
                        brokers in the registration described in 
                        paragraph (1); and

                        brokers at their own risk.
    (b) Centralized Data Deletion System.--
            (1) Establishment.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the 
                date of enactment of this section, the Commission shall 
                promulgate regulations to establish a centralized 
                system that--
                            (i) implements and maintains reasonable 
                        security procedures and practices (including 
                        administrative, physical, and technical 
                        safeguards) appropriate to the nature of the 
                        information and the purposes for which the 
                        personal information will be used, to protect 
                        individuals' personal information from 
                        unauthorized use, disclosure, access, 
                        destruction, or modification; and
                            (ii) allows an individual, through a single 
                        submission, to request that every data broker 
                        who is registered under subsection (a) and who 
                        maintains any persistent identifiers (as 
                        described in subparagraph (B)(iii)) delete any 
                        personal information related to such individual 
                        held by such data broker or affiliated legal 
                        entity of the data broker.
                    (B) Requirements.--The centralized system 
                established in subparagraph (A) shall meet the 
                following requirements:
                            (i) Subject to the regulations promulgated 
                        in accordance with paragraph (2)(B)(ii), the 
                        centralized system shall allow an individual to 
                        request the deletion of all personal 
                        information related to such individual through 
                        a single deletion request.
                            (ii) The centralized system shall provide a 
                        standardized form to allow an individual to 
                        make such request.
                            (iii) Such standardized form shall include 
                        the individual's email, phone number, physical 
                        address, and any other persistent identifier 
                        determined by the Commission to aid in the 
                        deletion request.
                            (iv) The centralized system shall 
                        automatically hash all submitted information 
                        and allow the Commission to maintain 
                        independent hashed registries of each type of 
                        information obtained through such form.
                            (v) The centralized system shall only 
                        permit data brokers who are registered with the 
                        Commission to submit hashed queries to the 
                        independent hashed registries described in 
                        clause (iv).
                            (vi) The centralized system shall allow an 
                        individual to make such request using an 
                        internet website operated by the Commission.
                            (vii) The centralized system shall not 
                        charge the individual to make such request.
                            (viii) The centralized system shall 
                        automatically delete any individual data field 
                        stored in the system once such data field has 
                        been stored in the centralized system for 2 
                        years. The Commission shall inform the 
                        individual of this automatic deletion period 
                        when the individual makes a deletion request. 
                        Beginning 4 years after the date of enactment 
                        of this Act, the Commission may promulgate 
                        rules to adjust such retention period or enable 
                        automatic renewal of requests if it determines 
                        that such adjustment or automatic renewal would 
                        better protect individual privacy or the public 
                        interest.
                    (C) Transition.--
                            (i) In general.--Not later than 8 months

                        promulgated under subparagraph (A), each data 
                        broker shall--
                                    (I) not less than once every 31 
                                days, access the hashed registries 
                                maintained by the Commission as 
                                described in subparagraph (B)(iv); and
                                    (II) process any deletion request 
                                associated with a match between such 
                                hashed registries and the records of 
                                the data broker.
                            (ii) FTC guidance.--Not later than 6 months 
                        after the effective date of the regulations 
                        promulgated under subparagraph (A), the 
                        Commission shall publish guidance on the

                        (1)(B)(iv), a data broker and any associated

                        information in its possession related to the 
                        individual making the request. Immediately 
                        following the deletion, the data broker shall

                        Commission with the number of records deleted

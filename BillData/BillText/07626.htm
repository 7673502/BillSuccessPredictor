                                 A BILL


 
    To direct the Attorney General to establish a pilot program to 
  determine the effectiveness of body-worn camera continuous training 
                               programs.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Although several studies have found significant 
        improvements in police-citizen encounters following the 
        implementation of body-worn cameras a recent meta-analysis of 
        the available research literature found that overall, the use 
        of body-worn cameras had no statistically significant impact on 
        officers' use of force.
            (2) Evidence suggests that one barrier to continuous 
        quality improvement through use of body-worn cameras is lack of 
        monitoring or a structured system of accountability. Body-worn 
        camera footage appears to be used for other purposes, such as 
        confirming the details of events for reports, rather than 
        quality improvement efforts.
            (3) Preliminary evidence from health care settings suggests 
        that body-worn cameras can have significant effects on behavior 
        if they are used for the purpose of continuous quality 
        improvement and feedback is provided.
            (4) Researchers have suggested that the implementation of 
        the health care model may show similar positive outcomes in 
        police accountability.

SEC. 2. PILOT PROGRAM FOR BODY-WORN CAMERA CONTINUOUS TRAINING.

    (a) Establishment of Program.--The Attorney General is authorized 
to establish a pilot program to determine the effectiveness of body-

    (b) Grants Authorized.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General is authorized to

        carrying out body-worn camera continuous training programs.
            (2) Duration.--The Attorney General shall award grants

                        assistance under this section is sought; and
                            (ii) provide such additional assurances as 
                        the Attorney General determines to be essential 
                        to ensure compliance with the requirements of 
                        this section.

Act, the term ``body-worn camera continuous training program'' means a 
training program carried out by a law enforcement agency, on an ongoing 
basis, that includes a supervisor conducting a review of a law 
enforcement officer's body-worn camera footage with that law 
enforcement officer, in order to improve policing, including community 
relations with law enforcement.

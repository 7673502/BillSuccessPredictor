                                 A BILL


 
To direct the Comptroller General of the United States, in coordination 
  with the National Academy of Sciences, to study alternatives for a 
     nonpartisan congressional office or agency to project the net 
 greenhouse gas emissions likely to be caused by Federal legislation, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Cost Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. STUDY OF ALTERNATIVES FOR A CONGRESSIONAL OFFICE TO PROJECT THE 
              NET GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LIKELY TO BE CAUSED BY 
              FEDERAL LEGISLATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States, in 
coordination with the National Academy of Sciences, shall--
            (1) study alternatives for a nonpartisan congressional 
        office or agency--
                    (A) to make thorough, science-based projections on 
                whether the enactment, full funding, and implementation 
                of particular Federal legislation are likely to cause a 
                net increase or decrease in global greenhouse gas 
                emissions over a specified period; and
                    (B) to quantify any such projected increase or 
                decrease; and
            (2) submit a report to the Congress containing the results 
        of such study, including recommendations.
    (b) Considerations.--The study under subsection (a) shall address 
each of the following:
            (1) Whether a new office or agency should be established 
        for purposes of carrying out the functions described in 
        subsection (a)(1), or whether such functions should be vested 
        in one or more existing offices or agencies.
            (2) How to ensure the office or agency remains nonpartisan 
        and science-focused.
            (3) How to involve governmental and private experts, 
        including--
                    (A) whether Federal officers and employees should 
                be detailed to the office or agency carrying out the 
                functions described in subsection (a)(1); and
                    (B) how to involve appropriate experts in the 
                analysis of projected greenhouse gas emissions from 
                each of the following: electric power generation; 
                transportation; residential, commercial, and industrial 
                fuel use; natural gas and oil systems; coal mining and 
                abandoned mines; agriculture; industrial processes; 
                land use, land use change, and forestry; and waste 
                management.
            (4) Lessons that can be learned from State legislatures 
        that have successfully implemented carbon scoring for 
        legislative proposals.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

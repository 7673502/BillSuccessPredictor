        used by the public and relevant to public safety; and
            (2) any other potential uses for such dogs relating to the 
        detection of early stages of diseases, including uses relating 
        to the management and provision of personal protective 
        equipment and medical testing kits to Department of Defense 
        personnel.
    (b) Regulations.--The Secretary shall prescribe regulations 
concerning the scope and limitations of the pilot program under 
subsection (a). Such regulations shall include requirements to ensure 
that the pilot program is scientifically rigorous.
    (c) Duration.--The Secretary shall carry out the pilot program 
under subsection (a) for a period of not more than four years.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date on which the 
pilot program under subsection (a) terminates, the Secretary shall 
submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate a report on the outcomes of such pilot 
program.

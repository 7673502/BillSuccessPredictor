                                 A BILL


 
   To authorize the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
 Prevention to carry out a Social Determinants of Health Program, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Social Determinants of 
Health Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Healthy People 2030 defines social determinants of 
        health as conditions in the environments where people are born, 
        live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide 
        range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and 
        risks.
            (2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2030 is 
        to ``create social, physical, and economic environments that 
        promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being 
        for all''.
            (3) Healthy People 2030 developed a ``place-based'' 
        organizing framework, reflecting five key areas of social 
        determinants of health namely--
                    (A) economic stability;
                    (B) education access and quality;
                    (C) social and community context;
                    (D) health care access and quality; and
                    (E) neighborhood and built environment.
            (4) It is estimated that medical care accounts for only 10 
        to 20 percent of the modifiable contributors to healthy 
        outcomes for a population.
            (5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has 
        indicated the importance of the social determinants in its work 
        stating that, ``As we seek to foster innovation, rethink rural 
        health, find solutions to the opioid epidemic, and continue to 
        put patients first, we need to take into account social 
        determinants of health and recognize their importance.''.
            (6) The Department of Health and Human Services' Public 
        Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the role of public health in 
        working across sectors on social determinants of health, as 
        well as the role of public health as chief health strategist in 
        communities.
            (7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years initiative, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has highlighted 
        nonclinical, community-wide approaches that show positive 
        health impacts, results within five years, and cost-
        effectiveness or cost-savings over the lifetime of the 
        population or earlier.
            (8) Health departments and the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention are not funded for such cross-cutting work.

amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(i) Analytical Tools for Evaluation of Energy Resilience 
Measures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall develop and implement a

energy resilience measures on military installations, uses analytical 
tools that are accurate and effective in projecting the costs and 
performance of such measures.
    ``(2) Analytical tools specified in paragraph (1) shall be--
            ``(A) designed to--
                    ``(i) provide an accurate projection of the costs

                selection official;
            ``(B) consistent with standards and analytical tools 
        commonly applied by the Department of Energy and by commercial 
        industry;
            ``(C) adaptable to accommodate a rapidly changing 
        technological environment;

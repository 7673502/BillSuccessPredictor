                                 A BILL


 
  To authorize the President to impose sanctions with respect to any 
 foreign person the President determines engages in public or private 
corruption activities that adversely affect a United States person, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Corruption Accountability 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) When public officials and their allies use the 
        mechanisms of government to engage in extortion or bribery, 
        they impoverish their countries' economic health and harm 
        citizens.
            (2) By empowering the United States Government to hold to 
        account foreign public officials and their associates who 
        engage in extortion or bribery, the United States can deter 
        malfeasance and ultimately serve the citizens of fragile 
        countries suffocated by corrupt bureaucracies.
            (3) The Special Inspector General for Afghan 
        Reconstruction's 2016 report ``Corruption in Conflict: Lessons 
        from the U.S. Experience in Afghanistan'' included the 
        recommendation, ``Congress should consider enacting legislation 
        that authorizes sanctions against foreign government officials 
        or their associates who engage in corruption.''.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.

    (a) In General.--The President may impose the sanctions described 
in subsection (b) with respect to any foreign person who is an

  To prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human Services from taking 
certain actions with respect to the clinical labor price, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Stability for Patients and 
Providers Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITING IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN LABOR PRICE UPDATES UNDER 
              THE 2022 PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE; REPORT.

    (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall maintain clinical labor 
prices under the 2022 physician fee schedule and not take any action to 
implement, finalize, or enforce the clinical labor price updates of the 
final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on 
November 19, 2021, entitled ``Medicare Program; CY 2022 Payment 
Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule and Other Changes to Part B 
Payment Policies; Medicare Shared Savings Program Requirements; 
Provider Enrollment Regulation Updates; Provider and Supplier 
Prepayment and Post-Payment Medical Review Requirements''.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
submit to Congress a report on the physician fee schedule under the 
Medicare program under section 1848 of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-4), including--
            (1) an analysis of provider reimbursement under such 
        physician fee schedule and whether or not such reimbursement 
        has sufficiently taken into account medical inflation over the 
        last 20 years;
            (2) an analysis of whether significant annual changes in 
        provider reimbursement are a cause of site-of-service migration 
        and disruptions in patient access and cost-sharing; and
            (3) based on paragraphs (1) and (2), recommendations for 
        reforming such fee schedule to minimize significant annual 
        changes in provider reimbursement and appropriately account for 
        inflation updates.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

        Education may determine.
    (b) Contents.--
            (1) Borrower information.--The longitudinal study carried 
        out under subsection (a) shall include borrower information, in 
        the aggregate and disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, 
        income, and status as an individual with a disability, on--
                    (A) student persistence;
                    (B) degree attainment;

        shall not be required in a case in which the number of 
        borrowers in a category is insufficient to yield statistically 
        reliable information or the results would reveal personally 
        identifiable information about an individual borrower.
    (c) Interim Reports.--Not later than 18 months after the 
commencement of the study under subsection (a), and annually

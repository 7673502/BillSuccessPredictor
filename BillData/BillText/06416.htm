                conduct investigations, to administer oaths or

                violation of any civil or criminal law of the State.

                regulation promulgated under this Act with respect to 
                the personal information of an individual constitutes a

                individual.
            (2) Invalidity of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and

                or how this paragraph applies to any dispute shall be 
                made by a court, rather than an arbitrator, without 
                regard to whether such agreement purports to delegate 
                such determination to an arbitrator.

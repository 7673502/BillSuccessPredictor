        include details on eligibility requirements for participation 
        in SNAP that a student must satisfy. The notification shall be,

        to identify and communicate with students who are likely to be 
        eligible for SNAP, including those eligible for a State or 
        federally financed work-study program.
            ``(4) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection:
                    ``(A) The term `eligible student' means a student 
                receiving work-study assistance under this part.
                    ``(B) The term `SNAP' means the supplemental 
                nutrition assistance program (as defined in section 
                3(t) of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C.

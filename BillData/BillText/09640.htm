    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

              TAX RETURNS.

    (a) Audit.--Subchapter A of chapter 78 of the Internal Revenue Code

inserting after section 7612 the following new section:

``SEC. 7613. EXAMINATION WITH RESPECT TO PRESIDENTIAL INCOME TAX 
              RETURNS.

    ``(a) In General.--As rapidly as practicable after the filing of 
any Presidential income tax return, the Secretary shall conduct an 
examination to ascertain the correctness of such return and enforce the 
requirements of this title with respect to the taxable year covered by 
such return.
    ``(b) Reports.--
            ``(1) Initial report.--Not later than 90 days after the 
        filing of a Presidential income tax return, the Secretary shall 
        disclose and make publicly available an initial report 
        regarding the examination with respect to such return. Such 
        report shall include--
                    ``(A) the name of the taxpayer,
                    ``(B) an identification of the subparagraph of 
                subsection (c)(1) which describes such return,
                    ``(C) the date that such return was filed, and
                    ``(D) the date on which the examination with 
                respect to such return commenced (or, if such 
                examination has not commenced as of the date of such 
                report, a detailed description of the reasons that such 
                examination has not commenced).
            ``(2) Periodic reports.--Not later than 180 days after the 
        disclosure of the report described in paragraph (1) with 
        respect to any Presidential income tax return and not later 
        than 180 days after the most recent disclosure of a report 
        described in this paragraph with respect to such return, the 
        Secretary shall disclose and make publicly available a periodic 
        report regarding the examination with respect to such return. 
        Such report shall include--
                    ``(A) the information described in subparagraphs 
                (A) through (D) of paragraph (1),

                factors (taking into account the specific facts and 
                circumstances of the examination), and the likely 
                specific effects of such factors on such time frame.
        Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a periodic report shall 
        not be required under this paragraph with respect to any return 
        after the date on which a final report is disclosed under 
        paragraph (3) with respect to such return.
            ``(3) Final report.--Not later than 90 days after the 
        completion of the examination described in subsection (a) with 
        respect to any Presidential income tax return, the Secretary 
        shall disclose and make publicly available a final report 
        regarding such examination. Such report shall include--

                section 6103(q)(2)) with respect to such examination,

                    ``(D) a description (including the amount) of each 
                proposed adjustment, adjustment, and controversy with 
                respect to such examination together with a description 
                of how such proposed adjustment or controversy was 
                resolved (or a statement that such proposed adjustment 
                or controversy was not resolved, as the case may be).
        For purposes of this paragraph, an examination shall be treated 
        as complete on the date that the Secretary provides the 
        taxpayer with a notice of deficiency, or any closing document 
        referred to in section 6103(q)(2)(A)(v), with respect to such 
        examination.
            ``(4) Extension of due date report.--If a request is made 
        for an extension of the due date for filing any Presidential 
        income tax return, the Secretary shall, not later than 90 days 
        after such request is granted or denied, disclose and make 
        publicly available an extension of due date report with respect 
        to return. Such report shall include--

                for the filing of such return has been requested,
                    ``(C) the date that such request was received,
                    ``(D) a statement of whether such request has been 
                granted or denied, and
                    ``(E) the due date of such return (including any 
                extensions).
            ``(5) Treatment of failure to file.--In the case of a 
        failure to file a Presidential income tax return before the 
        close of the 60-day period beginning with the date prescribed 
        for filing of such return--
                    ``(A) the Secretary shall conduct the examination 
                described in subsection (a) with respect to the taxable 
                year covered by the return to which such failure 
                relates,
                    ``(B) reports made pursuant to this paragraph shall 
                include a statement that such report is with respect to 
                a return which the taxpayer failed to file, and
                    ``(C) this section and section 6103(q) shall 
                otherwise apply to such failure in the same manner as 
                if a return were filed at the close of such period.
        The application of this paragraph with respect to any failure 
        to file a Presidential income tax return shall not prevent the 
        application of this section with respect to such return at such 
        time as such return may be filed.
            ``(6) Public availability.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, a document shall not be treated as having been made

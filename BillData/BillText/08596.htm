SEC. 2. NATIONAL BIOCHAR RESEARCH NETWORK.

    Title IV of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education 
Reform Act of 1998 is amended by inserting before section 404 (7 U.S.C. 
7624) the following new section:

``SEC. 403. NATIONAL BIOCHAR RESEARCH NETWORK.

    ``(a) Establishment.--The Secretary shall establish a national 
biochar research network of not more than 20 research sites to test the 
full range of biochar types across soil types, soil conditions, 
application methods, and climatic and agronomic regions to--
            ``(1) assess the soil carbon sequestration potential of 
        biochar;
            ``(2) understand how to use biochar productively to 
        contribute to climate mitigation, crop production, resilience 
        to extreme weather events, ecosystem health, and natural 
        resource conservation; and
            ``(3) deliver science-based, region-specific, cost-
        effective, and practical information to farmers, ranchers,

        sustainable biochar production and application.
    ``(b) Scope.--The national biochar research network established 
under subsection (a) shall encompass agriculture, horticulture, 
rangeland, forestry, and other biochar uses and a broad range of 
feedstocks, production processes, and application treatments. The 
research conducted shall include--
            ``(1) cross-site and mechanistic experiments to--
                    ``(A) fill critical knowledge gaps and gain a more 
                complete understanding of the impact of various types 
                of biochar in varying site conditions on soil 
                properties, plant growth, greenhouse gas emissions, and 
                carbon sequestration in different soils, climates, and 
                other natural and agronomic conditions;
                    ``(B) provide mechanistic and techno-economic 
                insights on thermochemical conversion processes in 
                biochar production and the co-production of biochar and 
                bioenergy, including interactions of feedstock 
                properties with reactor conditions and processes on the 
                relative proportions and properties of biochar, bio-
                fuels, and value-added co-products, as well as process 
                efficiency;
                    ``(C) generate data to develop, calibrate, and 
                validate robust mechanistic models to predict the full 
                life cycle of greenhouse gas, crop response, and 
                related agronomic and environmental implications of 
                particular applications of biochar;
                    ``(D) generate data to help guide the design of 
                new, more-efficient biochar and bioenergy production 
                reactors and biorefineries; and
                    ``(E) generate data to develop, calibrate, and 
                validate testing methodologies for biochar to identify 
                potential contaminants or other factors that may cause 
                unintended consequences;
            ``(2) site-specific farm and forestry systems assessments 
        and pilot-scale biochar production and application systems to--
                    ``(A) refine the most promising soil-based uses, 
                sources, and methods of producing and applying biochar 
                in particular regions to enhance productivity, increase 
                profitability, scalability, and portability, reduce 
                greenhouse gas emissions, improve ecosystem health, and 
                strengthen resilience to extreme weather events, and 
                explore soil, crop, climate, management, and biochar 
                interactions;
                    ``(B) develop new knowledge to support decisions on 
                sustainable production and use of biochar;
                    ``(C) collect relevant data needed for full life 
                cycle greenhouse gas and economic analyses and complete 
                such analysis;

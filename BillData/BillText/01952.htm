      To provide for the establishment of a national standard for 
 incorporating a passive identification ability into all firearms sold 
 in the United States, and to require the reporting of lost or stolen 
        firearms to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping the Iron Pipeline Act of 
2021''.

SEC. 2. PASSIVE CAPABILITY TO IDENTIFY LOST AND STOLEN FIREARMS.

    (a) Establishment of National Standard.--
            (1) In general.--The Attorney General shall, in 
        consultation with the National Institute for Standards and 
        Technology, establish in regulations a national standard for 
        the incorporation of a passive identification capability into 
        all firearms sold in the United States.
            (2) Passive identification capability defined.--In this 
        section, the term ``passive identification capability'' means a 
        technology that--
                    (A) enables a firearm to be identified by a mobile 
                or fixed reading device; and
                    (B) does not emit or broadcast an electronic signal 
                or other information that would enable the firearm or 
                its owner to be monitored or tracked.
            (3) Considerations.--In developing the standard, the 
        Attorney General shall give equal priority to the following:
                    (A) The right of firearm owners to maintain their 
                full right to privacy under the 4th Amendment and their 
                right to legally own firearms under the 2nd Amendment.
                    (B) The ability of law enforcement authorities to 
                use the capability to track lost and stolen guns.
                    (C) The ability of manufacturers to incorporate the 
                capability using existing firearm manufacturing 
                processes.
                    (D) The resistance to tampering and destruction of 
                the technology used to incorporate the capability.
    (b) Prohibition; Penalty.--
            (1) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for a person, in or 
        affecting interstate or foreign commerce, to manufacture a 
        firearm that does not have a passive identification capability 
        that meets the national standard established under subsection 
        (a).
            (2) Civil penalty.--After notice and opportunity for 
        hearing, the Attorney General shall impose on a person who 
        violates paragraph (1) a civil money penalty in such amount, 
        not exceeding $2,500 per firearm, as the Attorney General shall 
        prescribe in regulations.
            (3) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on 
        such date as the Attorney General shall prescribe in 
        regulations that is not later than 3 years after the 
        establishment of the national standard under subsection (a).

SEC. 3. REPORTING OF LOST OR STOLEN FIREARMS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
              AUTHORITIES.

    (a) Reporting Requirement.--Section 922 of title 18, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(aa) Within 48 hours after a person who owns a firearm that has 
been shipped or transported in, or has been possessed in or affecting, 
interstate or foreign commerce, discovers or should have discovered the 
theft or loss of the firearm, the person shall report the theft or loss 
to local law enforcement authorities. To the best of the person's 
ability, the person shall provide the following information, if known:
            ``(1) A description of the firearm, including the make, 
        model, manufacturer, caliber, and serial number of the firearm, 
        and any other distinguishing number or identification mark on 
        the firearm.
            ``(2) Whether the firearm is being reported lost or stolen.
            ``(3) The date of the loss or theft.
            ``(4) The person's name and address.
            ``(5) The location from which the firearm was lost or 
        stolen.''.
    (b) Penalties.--Section 924 of such title is amended by adding at 
the end the following:
    ``(q) Penalties for Failure To Report Loss or Theft of Firearm.--
Whoever violates section 922(aa) shall be fined $10,000, imprisoned not 
more than 1 year, or both, with respect to each firearm involved in the 
violation.''.
    (c) Requirement That Local Law Enforcement Authorities Report Lost 
or Stolen Firearms to the National Crime Information Center.--Within 7 
days after a local law enforcement authority receives a report that a 
firearm is lost or stolen, the authority shall transmit the report to 
the National Crime Information Center maintained by the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation.

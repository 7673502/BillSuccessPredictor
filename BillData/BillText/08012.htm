                                 A BILL


 
   To address the importance of foreign affairs training to national 
                   security, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``State Department Training 
Modernization Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of State is a crucial national security 
        agency, whose employees, both Foreign Service and Civil 
        Service, require the best possible training and professional 
        development at every stage of their careers to prepare them to 
        promote and defend United States national interests and the 
        health and safety of United States citizens abroad;
            (2) the Department faces increasingly complex and rapidly 
        evolving challenges, many of which are science and technology-
        driven, and which demand continual, high-quality training and 
        professional development of its personnel;
            (3) the new and evolving challenges of national security in 
        the 21st century necessitates the expansion of standardized 
        training and professional development opportunities linked to 
        equitable, accountable, and transparent promotion and 
        leadership practices for Department of State and other national 
        security agency personnel; and
            (4) consistent with gift acceptance authority of the 
        Department and other applicable laws in effect as of the date 
        of the enactment of this Act, the Department and the Foreign 
        Service Institute may accept funds and other resources from 
        foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and other appropriate 
        sources to help the Department and the Institute enhance the 
        quantity and quality of training and professional development 
        offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative, 
        and pilot model courses.

SEC. 3. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.

    In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' 
means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 4. TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIZATION.

    In order to provide the Civil Service of the Department of State

                universities, industry entities, and nongovernmental 
                organizations, throughout the United States to provide 
                useful outside perspectives to Department personnel to 
                provide such personnel--
                            (i) a more comprehensive outlook on

            (2) offer courses using computer-based or computer-assisted 
        simulations, allowing civilian officers to lead decision-making 
        in a crisis environment, and encourage officers of the

        private sector; and
            (3) increase the duration and expand the focus of certain

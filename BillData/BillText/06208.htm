under subsection (c)(3), at no cost to such veterans. Under the pilot

veterans suffering fewer complications of chronic ailments, thereby 
yielding a lower cost of care.
    (b) Eligible Veteran Defined.--For purposes of this section, the 
term ``eligible veteran'' means a veteran who--
            (1) is enrolled in the system of annual patient enrollment

        pilot program.
            (3) Enrollment; categorization.--The Secretary shall enroll 
        at least 1,500 eligible veterans who apply for the pilot 
        program, giving preference to veterans with service-connected 
        disabilities that increases in accordance with the veterans' 
        disability ratings under chapter 11 of title 38, United States 
        Code, in a manner that ensures the following:

categorized under subsection (c)(3).
    (g) Course of Program.--
            (1) Periodontal therapy.--The Secretary shall make timely

        regarding how such veteran may obtain dental services and 
        treatment after the end of the pilot program.

institutions of higher education (as that term is defined in section 
102 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)) that offer

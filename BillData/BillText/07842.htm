        of location of a property in relation to an area designated as 
        an area having special flood hazards.
            ``(2) Eligibility.--The Administration may provide 
        expedited assistance under this subsection with respect to a

                community participating in the national flood insurance 
                program agrees to take title to the property in 
                accordance with the terms under section 404(b) of the 
                Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
                Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(b)) and has prioritized 
                mitigation to such property or to the area in which

        filed and the conditions under paragraph (2) exist, the 
        Administrator shall expeditiously determine, considering 
        current and future risks, if a property buyout would result in 
        long-term benefits to the National Flood Insurance Fund. For 
        buyouts determined to be beneficial, amounts in the National 
        Flood Insurance Fund may be used immediately to make 
        acquisition offers under this subsection in lieu of full claims 
        payments. Such offers may exceed the amount of the claim and 
        shall comply with requirements for buyout offers authorized 
        under section 404 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
        Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c). In no case shall

        claims due to a policyholder for contents coverage or necessary 
        clean-up costs.''.

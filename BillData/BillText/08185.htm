                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and improve the 
National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program for fiscal 
            years 2023 through 2027, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Screening for Communities to Receive 
Early and Equitable Needed Services for Cancer Act'' or the ``SCREENS 
for Cancer Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2022, there will be more than 290,500 new cases of 
        invasive breast cancer and nearly 44,000 breast cancer deaths 
        in the United States.
            (2) In 2022, there will be about 14,100 new cases of 
        invasive cervical cancer and about 4,280 deaths from cervical 
        cancer.
            (3) Black women have the highest breast, cervical, and 
        uterine cancer death rates of all racial and ethnic groups and 
        are more likely to be diagnosed with triple-negative breast 
        cancer, a more aggressive form of cancer.
            (4) Research shows that the COVID-19 pandemic was 
        associated with a decline of more than 3,900,000 breast cancer 
        screenings in 2020, as compared to 2019. Similarly, cervical 
        cancer screening utilization dropped by 90 percent in April 
        2020, relative to the prior year.
            (5) Recent National Cancer Institute studies have estimated 
        that pandemic-related disruptions or delays in breast care and 
        screening are expected to result in an excess of 2,500 breast 
        cancer deaths by 2030.
            (6) Since its creation in 1991, the National Breast and 
        Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (referred to in this 
        section as the ``NBCCEDP'') has provided lifesaving cancer 
        screening and diagnostic services to low-income, uninsured, or 
        underinsured women in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, 
        6 territories, and 13 Tribes or Tribal organizations.
            (7) NBCCEDP seeks to reduce inequities in breast and 
        cervical cancer screening and diagnosis, placing special 
        emphasis on outreach to women who are members of racial or 
        ethnic minority groups, and those who are geographically or 
        culturally isolated.
            (8) NBCCEDP has served more than 6,000,000 people and 
        provided more than 15,600,000 breast and cervical cancer 
        screening examinations.
            (9) These screening exams have diagnosed over 70,000 
        invasive breast cancers and 23,000 premalignant breast lesions, 
        as well as over 5,000 invasive cervical cancers and 230,000 
        premalignant cervical lesions, of which 39 percent were high-
        grade.
            (10) The program also provides public education, outreach, 
        patient navigation, and care coordination to increase breast 
        and cervical cancer screening rates and reach underserved 
        populations.
            (11) Reauthorizing NBCCEDP will result in expanded 
        services, leading to more people being screened and more 
        cancers diagnosed at earlier stages.

    (b) Study and Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, and after issuing a notice of inquiry seeking 
public comment on the issues described in this subsection, the 
Commission shall conduct a study and submit to the appropriate 
congressional committees a report examining the feasibility of funding 
the Universal Service Fund through contributions supplied by edge 
providers, which shall include the consideration of comments on, and 
the findings of the Commission with respect to--
            (1) the class of firms and services on which contributions 
        could be assessed, including an inquiry into the specific 
        sources of revenue potentially subject to contributions, such 
        as digital advertising revenue and user fees;
            (2) the equity issues of the current contributions system, 
        including the cost burden on consumers who traditionally 
        purchase legacy telecommunications services;
            (3) equity issues of alternative contributions systems that 
        would create new funding sources for the Universal Service Fund 
        such as Federal appropriations or assessments on edge 
        providers;
            (4) whether a particular contributions system results in 
        progressive or regressive fees;
            (5) the size of firms subject to contributions 
        requirements;
            (6) the broadband requirements, such as bandwidth and 
        latency, of a particular online service;
            (7) other Federal, State, and local taxes and fees that 
        edge providers may already pay;
            (8) practical issues concerning the calculation of 
        contributions, including which revenues should be subject to 
        contributions, whether a flat or progressive rate is most 
        appropriate, and the logistics of collection;
            (9) the effect such a change would have on 
        telecommunications bills of consumers, including low-income, 
        elderly, and Tribal consumers;
            (10) the effect such a change would have on the 
        sustainability of the Universal Service Fund, and how to ensure 
        that Universal Service Fund disbursements are consistent and 
        predictable over time;
            (11) the statutory authority the Commission would require 
        to enact such a change and how such a change would interact 
        with existing Federal and State law; and
            (12) the continued necessity of the Universal Service Fund 
        once advanced telecommunications capability is available to all 
        people in the United States.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

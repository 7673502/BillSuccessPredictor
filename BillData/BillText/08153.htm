                                 A BILL


 
 To support diplomatic and development resourcing to the Indo-Pacific, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Indo-Pacific Engagement Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Indo-Pacific region is home to some 60 percent of 
        the world's population.
            (2) The Indo-Pacific region contains some of the most 
        dynamic and rapidly growing economies in the world.
            (3) A free and open Indo-Pacific is essential to American 
        security and prosperity in the 21st century.
            (4) The United States has made significant commitments of 
        diplomatic and foreign assistance resources to the region over 
        the past century, which have supported shared growth and 
        prosperity.
            (5) A sustained and enhanced commitment is required to 
        advance American interests in the 21st century.
            (6) Historically, independent cost assessments have served 
        as effective tools to enhance public debate over resource 
        allocation and have helped Congress make more informed 
        decisions.
            (7) The importance and urgency of enhancing U.S. engagement 
        in the Indo-Pacific is such that similar tools are required to 
        ensure a proper level of engagement with the region.

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the 
        amount which may be insured under this section may be increased 
        by up to 20 percent if such increase is necessary to account 
        for the increased cost of the residence due to the installation 
        of a solar energy system (as defined in subparagraph (3) of the 
        last paragraph of section 2(a) of this Act) therein.
        Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the 
        Secretary may not insure, or enter into a commitment to insure, 
        a mortgage under this section that is executed by a first-time 
        homebuyer and that involves a principal obligation (including 
        such initial service charges, appraisal, inspection, and other 
        fees as the Secretary shall approve) in excess of 97 percent of 
        the appraised value of the property unless the mortgagor has 
        completed a program of counseling with respect to the 
        responsibilities and financial management involved in 
        homeownership that is approved by the Secretary; except that 
        the Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, waive 
        the applicability of this requirement.''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:

                that exceeds 115 percent of the median 1-family home 
                price for the area within which such city or county is 
                located and is located in an area that, as determined 
                by the Secretary, experienced a decrease in maximum 
                principal obligation amount under this paragraph for 1-

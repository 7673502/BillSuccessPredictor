                            ``(ii) the employer obtains written consent 
                        to record and use such image in accordance with 
                        such disclosure; and
                    ``(B) in any event the employer seeks to use an 
                image already recorded for a purpose not included in 
                such disclosure, the employer issues a new disclosure 
                in writing and obtains written consent for such new 
                purpose; or
            ``(2) to discharge or in any other manner retaliate against

                    ``(iii) in the case of an employer with more than 
                200 employees but not more than 500 employees, of 
                $100,000 for a first offense, increased by an 
                additional $20,000 for each subsequent offense; and

        who was the subject of the violation for special damages not to 
        exceed $10,000 plus attorneys' fees, and shall be subject to 
        such injunctive relief as may be appropriate.
    ``(2) An action to recover the liability described in paragraph 
(1)(B) may be maintained against any employer (including a public 
agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any 
one or more employees or prospective employees for and on behalf of--
            ``(A) the employees or prospective employees; and
            ``(B) other employees or prospective employees similarly 
        situated.''.

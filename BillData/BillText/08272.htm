SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE STOCKPILE REQUIREMENTS AND 
              CAPACITY RELATING TO RARE EARTH ELEMENTS AND COVERED 
              CRITICAL MINERALS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that increasing the storage of 
substantial quantities of rare earth elements, covered critical 
minerals, and rare earth or covered critical mineral products in the 
National Defense Stockpile will--
            (1) diminish the vulnerability of the United States to the 
        effects of severe disruptions to the supply chains for such 
        elements, minerals, and products; and
            (2) provide limited protection from the consequences of an 
        interruption in supplies of such elements, minerals, and 
        products, particularly such elements, minerals, and products 
        required to meet the needs of the Armed Forces and the defense 
        industrial and technology sectors.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to 
expand and maintain a strategic reserve of rare earth elements, covered 
critical minerals, and rare earth or covered critical mineral products.
    (c) Declaration of Purposes.--Section 2 of the Strategic and 
Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98a) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(d) The quantities of rare earth elements, covered critical 
minerals, and rare earth or covered critical mineral products 
stockpiled under this Act should be sufficient to sustain the United 
States Armed Forces and the defense industrial and technology sectors 
of the United States for a period of not less than 3 years during a 
national emergency situation that would necessitate total mobilization 
of the economy of the United States for a sustained conventional global 
war of indefinite duration.''.
    (d) National Emergency Planning Assumptions for Rare Earth Elements 
and Covered Critical Minerals.--Section 14 of the Strategic and 
Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98h-5) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (b), in the second sentence, by striking 
        ``The Secretary shall base'' and inserting ``Except as provided 
        in subsection (c), the Secretary shall base'';
            (2) by redesignating subsections (c), (d), and (e) as 
        subsections (d), (e), and (f), respectively; and
            (3) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:
    ``(c) The Secretary shall base the Secretary's recommendations 
under subsection (a)(1) with respect to stockpile requirements for rare 
earth elements, covered critical minerals, and rare earth or covered 
critical mineral products on a national emergency situation that would 
last for a period of not less than 3 years and necessitate total 
mobilization of the economy of the United States for a sustained 
conventional global war of indefinite duration.''.
    (e) Limited Acquisition Authority.--The Strategic and Critical 
Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. 98 et seq.) is amended--
            (1) in section 3(c)(2) (50 U.S.C. 98b(c)(2)), by striking 
        ``The President'' and inserting ``In the case of acquisitions 
        of materials the cost of which exceeds the amount specified in 
        section 5(a)(3), the President'';
            (2) in section 5(a) (50 U.S.C. 98d(a))--
                    (A) in paragraph (1), in the first sentence, by 
                inserting ``under the authority of paragraph (3) or'' 
                after ``Except for acquisitions made''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(3) The Secretary of Defense may acquire materials determined to 
be strategic and critical under section 3(a), including rare earth 
elements, covered critical minerals, and rare earth or covered critical 
mineral products, without regard to the requirement of the first 
sentence of subsection (a) if the cost of the materials does not exceed 
$10,000,000.'';
            (3) in section 10(c) (50 U.S.C. 98h-1(c))--

                                 A BILL


 
   To provide increased financial assistance for farmers markets and 
  farmers' market nutrition programs, to increase local agricultural 
   production through food bank in-house production and local farmer 
                  contracting, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

     This Act may be cited as ``Farmers Market and Food Bank Local 
Revitalization Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Food insecurity, epidemic levels of obesity, 
        hypertension, diabetes, and youth osteoporosis are caused by 
        improper nutrition yielded by lack of nutritious, reliable, and 
        locally available healthy food options.
            (2) The American Diabetes Association estimated a 41-
        percent increase in costs of diagnosed diabetes from 2007 
        ($174,000,000,000) to 2012 ($245,000,000,000) with most of 
        these costs (62 percent) coming from senior health programs 
        such as Medicare and Medicaid.
            (3) Since sequestration in 2008, there has been no funding 
        increase for the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program.
            (4) From 2008 to 2020, the moderate at home food cost for a 
        family of 2 (aged 51-70 years old) increased by an average of 
        $70 a month. Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program funding 
        has not kept pace with such inflation.
            (5) According to the Department of Agriculture, Seniors 
        Farmers' Market Nutrition Program has a total program funding 
        backlog of $20,065,021 and a season benefit level backlog of 
        $16,120,741 across all participating States, territories, and 
        Native American Tribes.
            (6) Roughly 1 in 10 United States senior citizens (about 
        5,146,000) are forced to live well below the Federal poverty 
        level, and the Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program is 
        only able to reach about 725,000 due to inadequate funding.
            (7) Since sequestration in 2008, funding for farmers' 
        market nutrition programs has fallen by over $6,000,000 and 
        never rebounded.
            (8) The farmers' market nutrition program is a vital 
        safeguard for the nearly 1 in 7 children who will be born into 
        poverty in the United States and will be at nutritional risk.
            (9) According to the Department of Agriculture, the 
        farmers' market nutrition program has a total program and 
        seasonal benefit funding backlog of $6,198,432 across all 
        participating States, territories, and Native American Tribes.
            (10) In the United States, food banks will provide meals to 
        1 in 7 people.
            (11) Many food banks share special relationships with local 
        farmers who often donate their crops to food banks. The 
        partnership allows for more efficient and sustainable 
        procurement for food banks.
            (12) Assisting food banks to grow their own food will aid 
        local procurement and allow food banks to serve as farming 
        resources to their communities, especially to those who are 
        food insecure.
            (13) The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 specifically 
        required looking at ways to incorporate local goods to reduce 
        food waste.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to increase and enhance funding for farmers' market 
        nutrition programs to support seniors, food insecure families, 
        and to increase market capacity for local farmers;
            (2) to provide funding assistance for the expansion and 
        construction of farmers markets in both rural and urban food 
        desert areas; and
            (3) to increase local food production through partnership 
        with food banks by local farmer contracting and funding 
        assistance to food banks to grow necessary produce through 
        traditional or controlled environment agricultural farming.

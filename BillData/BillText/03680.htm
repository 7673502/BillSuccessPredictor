SEC. 2. PROPERTY DISPOSITION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

    Section 5334(h)(1) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to 
read as follows:
            ``(1) In general.--If a recipient of assistance under this 
        chapter decides an asset acquired under this chapter at least 
        in part with that assistance is no longer needed for the 
        purpose for which such asset was acquired, the Secretary may 
        authorize the recipient to transfer such asset to--
                    ``(A) a local governmental authority to be used for 
                a public purpose with no further obligation to the 
                Government if the Secretary decides--
                            ``(i) the asset will remain in public use 
                        for at least 5 years after the date the asset 
                        is transferred;
                            ``(ii) there is no purpose eligible for 
                        assistance under this chapter for which the 
                        asset should be used;
                            ``(iii) the overall benefit of allowing the 
                        transfer is greater than the interest of the 
                        Government in liquidation and return of the 
                        financial interest of the Government in the 
                        asset, after considering fair market value and 
                        other factors; and
                            ``(iv) through an appropriate screening or 
                        survey process, that there is no interest in 
                        acquiring the asset for Government use if the 
                        asset is a facility or land; or
                    ``(B) a local governmental authority, nonprofit 
                organization, or other third-party entity to be used 
                for the purpose of transit-oriented development with no 
                further obligation to the Government if the Secretary 
                decides--
                            ``(i) the asset is a necessary component of 
                        a proposed transit-oriented development 
                        project;
                            ``(ii) the transit-oriented development 
                        project will increase transit ridership;
                            ``(iii) at least 40 percent of the housing 
                        units offered in the transit-oriented

                        below 60 percent the area median income, which 
                        shall include at least 20 percent of such 
                        housing units offered restricted to tenants 
                        with incomes at or below 30 percent of the area

                                allowing the transfer is greater than

                                 A BILL


 
     To direct the Director of the Bureau of Prisons to conduct a 
comprehensive review of understaffing across the Bureau, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prison Staffing Reform Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Bureau of Prisons has 121 institutions located 
        throughout the United States and employs nearly 35,000 
        employees. Understaffing across the agency jeopardizes the 
        health, safety, and well-being of staff and inmates alike.
            (2) Understaffing at Bureau of Prison institutions poses a 
        threat to inmates, who will consequently lack access to 
        lifesaving medical care, efficient review of their casework, 
        sanitary living conditions, access to vital recidivism 
        reduction programming, and protections against abuse or sexual 
        misconduct.
            (3) Understaffing at Bureau of Prison institutions will 
        also result in reduced staff safety, escalated workplace abuse, 
        stressful work conditions, enhanced mental and physical health 
        concerns, and unacceptably long work shifts for employees.
            (4) Mandated overtime, misuse of augmentation or 
        reassignment, and overworked employees will reduce prison 
        security and threaten public safety.

SEC. 3. COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF UNDERSTAFFING ACROSS BUREAU OF PRISONS.

    (a) Review.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall--

        subsection (b), of staffing across the Bureau of Prisons, as 
        well as the impact of any understaffing on employees,

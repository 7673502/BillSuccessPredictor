                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to 
   condition eligibility for grants under the Edward Byrne Memorial 
       Justice Assistance Grant Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Justice Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) There are an estimated 70,000,000 adults in the United 
        States with an arrest or conviction history.
            (2) Nearly 700,000 adults reenter their communities after 
        incarceration every year.
            (3) Research shows that a conviction record reduces the 
        likelihood of a job callback or offer by nearly 50 percent.
            (4) Employment is a critical factor in successful community 
        reentry and reduction of recidivism for adults with a 
        conviction history.
            (5) After two years, nearly twice as many employed adults 
        with criminal records avoided another interaction with the 
        criminal justice system compared to their unemployed 
        counterparts.
            (6) A study conducted by the Kellogg School of Management 
        at Northwestern University found the turnover rate for employed 
        adults with criminal records to be approximately 13 percent 
        lower than individuals without criminal records.

SEC. 3. ELIGIBILITY FOR GRANTS UNDER THE BYRNE JAG PROGRAM.

    (a) Eligibility for Grants Under the Byrne JAG Program.--Section 
505(a) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34

        legislation that prohibits private employers from--

                the applicant has a criminal record;
                    ``(B) inquiring about the criminal record of an

    (b) Reallocation of Funds.--Section 505(f) of the Omnibus Crime 
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10156(f)) is amended--

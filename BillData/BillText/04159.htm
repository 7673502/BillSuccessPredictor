organization that--
            (1) meets the requirements of section 501(c)(3) of the 
        Internal Revenue Code of 1986;
            (2) is exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such 
        Code; and

                assistance dog organization.
    (b) Best Practice Guidelines.--Not later than 18 months after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall develop and 
publish best practices for the use of dogs to provide support for 
defendants, complainants, and witnesses in Federal courtrooms and grand

            (1) avoiding prejudice;
            (2) addressing whether and when dog handlers should be 
        required, and what training, credentials, or experience should

the Attorney General shall issue guidance informing all United States 
attorneys of the best practice guidelines and recommending the

        person in accordance with applicable law; or
            (2) retaining control of the courtroom.

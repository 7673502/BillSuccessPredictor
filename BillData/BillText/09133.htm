 clearinghouse for information on incidents of homegrown ``lone wolf'' 
 terrorism, domestic terrorism, and persons providing material support

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Freezing Assets of Suspected 
Terrorists and Enemy Recruits Act of 2022'' or the ``FASTER Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FREEZING OF ASSETS OF DOMESTIC TERROR SUSPECTS.

    (a) In General.--If an individual is arrested by a Federal law 
enforcement agency (or by a State or local law enforcement agency and 
subsequently turned over to a Federal law enforcement agency) under 
suspicion of participating in domestic terrorism or providing material 
support to terrorists, such Federal law enforcement agency shall notify 
FinCEN of such arrest and, upon such notification, FinCEN shall order 
each financial institution holding assets of the individual to freeze 
such assets.
    (b) Disposition of Assets.--
            (1) Notice of freezing.--FinCEN shall, as soon as 
        practicable, but not later than 60 days after ordering a 
        financial institution to freeze an individual's assets under 
        subsection (a), notify such individual of such asset freezing.
            (2) Right to contest.--
                    (A) In general.--A Federal district court of 
                competent jurisdiction shall, on motion by an 
                individual whose assets have been frozen under this 
                section, order the individual's assets unfrozen unless 
                the Government establishes by probable cause that such 
                assets are subject to seizure under this section.
                    (B) Representation.--
                            (i) In general.--If an individual whose 
                        assets have been frozen under this section is 
                        financially unable to obtain representation by 
                        counsel with respect to the motion described 
                        under subparagraph (A), the court may order the 
                        individual's assets unfrozen in an amount 
                        necessary to pay for such counsel, and such 
                        unfrozen funds may only be used to pay for such 
                        counsel.
                            (ii) Factors to consider.--In determining 
                        whether to order the unfreezing of funds under 
                        clause (i), a court shall take into account the 
                        individual's standing to bring such a motion 
                        and whether the motion appears to be made in 
                        good faith.
            (3) Unfreezing of property.--FinCEN shall order an 
        individual's assets unfrozen if--
                    (A) FinCEN does not provide the notice described 
                under paragraph (1) within 60 days of ordering the 
                assets frozen;
                    (B) a criminal indictment is not filed against the 
                individual with respect to participation in domestic 
                terrorism or providing material support to terrorists 
                within 90 days after FinCEN orders the assets frozen; 
                or
                    (C) the individual is tried for domestic terrorism 
                or providing material support to terrorists and is not 
                convicted.
            (4) Confiscation upon conviction.--If an individual whose 
        assets have been frozen under this section is convicted of 
        domestic terrorism or providing material support to terrorists, 
        FinCEN shall--
                    (A) confiscate all such assets that were involved 
                in such crime, or that constitute or derive from 
                proceeds traceable to such crime, and may--
                            (i) distribute assets to victims of the 
                        individual;
                            (ii) transfer assets to the Attorney 
                        General for distribution to law enforcement for 
                        counterterrorism purposes; or
                            (iii) use assets for such other purpose as 
                        FinCEN determines appropriate; and
                    (B) order all other such assets unfrozen.

 To direct the Secretary of Energy to support research and development 
on extraction of uranium from seawater to reduce the dependence of the 
    United States on imported uranium, illustrating that innovative 
 technology for domestic extraction could be a more cost efficient and 
   environmentally friendly alternative than traditional extraction 
                    methods, and for other purposes.

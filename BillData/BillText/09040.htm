                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Public Health Service Act to improve reproductive health 
                 care of individuals with disabilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Reproductive Health Care 
Accessibility Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States, there are approximately 1 in 4 
        adults with disabilities, 1 in 10 individuals with disabilities 
        who are able to become pregnant, and approximately 4,100,000 
        parents with disabilities.
            (2) All people, including individuals with disabilities, 
        have the right to decide if, when, and how to start and raise a 
        family.
            (3) Title II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
        of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131 et seq. and 12181 et seq.), section 
        504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), and 
        section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act 
        (42 U.S.C. 18116) provide individuals with disabilities with 
        the right to equitably access and receive health care.
            (4) Disabled people face unique barriers when accessing 
        reproductive health care, including accessibility at health 
        care facilities, lack of accessible medical diagnostic 
        equipment, barriers to accessible travel, delay in receiving 
        preventative services, and lack of health care providers with 
        training and knowledge on the needs of individuals with 
        disabilities receiving reproductive health care.
            (5) The United States Access Board has established 
        standards for accessible medical diagnostic equipment, however 
        without enforceable standards adopted by the Department of 
        Health and Human Services and Department of Justice, systemic 
        improvements in the availability of accessible medical 
        diagnostic equipment will not be achieved.
            (6) Disabled people have an equal right to reproductive 
        autonomy, but harmful stereotypes create barriers to getting 
        care that respects that autonomy.
            (7) Laws that restrict access to reproductive health care, 
        including abortion care, disproportionally harm people who 
        already face barriers to reproductive health care which 
        includes disabled people.
            (8) Individuals with and without disabilities want children 
        at the same frequency, but individuals with disabilities 
        experience less likelihood of receiving contraception 
        counseling and timely prenatal care, experience a higher rate 
        of sterilization, and are at a greater risk for adverse 
        pregnancy outcomes.
            (9) Diversity and inclusion in the health care workforce is 
        a critical factor in the delivery of high-quality, culturally 
        competent health care and improves patient outcomes. However, 
        the rate of students and trainees with disabilities in medical 
        and allied health education remains low compared to those 
        without disabilities.

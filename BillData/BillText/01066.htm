                                 AN ACT


 
     To amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency 
  Assistance Act to provide flexibility with the cost share for fire 
             management assistance, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wildfire Recovery Act''.

SEC. 2. FIRE MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COST SHARE.

    (a) In General.--Section 420 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster 
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (e) as subsection (f); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (d) the following:
    ``(e) Federal Share.--The Federal share of assistance under this 
section shall be not less than 75 percent of the eligible cost of such 
assistance.''.
    (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by subsection (a) shall only 
apply to amounts appropriated on or after the date of enactment of this 
Act.

SEC. 3. RULEMAKING.

    Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
President, acting through the Administrator of the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, shall conduct and complete a rulemaking to provide 
criteria for the circumstances under which the Administrator may 
recommend the President increase the Federal cost share for section 420 
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act 
(42 U.S.C. 5187). Such criteria shall include a threshold metric that 
assesses the financial impact to a State or local government from 
responding to a fire for which fire management assistance is being 
provided.

            Passed the House of Representatives September 13, 2022.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.

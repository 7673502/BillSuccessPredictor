    To require justification for transfer or elimination of flying 
                   missions, and for other purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Flying Mission Oversight and 
Transparency Act''.

SEC. 2. JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSFER OR ELIMINATION OF FLYING MISSIONS.

    (a) In General.--Prior to the relocation or elimination of any 
flying mission, either with respect to an active or reserve component 
of a covered Armed Force, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the 
congressional defense committees a report describing the justification 
of the Secretary for the decision to relocate or eliminate such 
mission. Such report shall include each of the following:
            (1) A description of how the decision supports the national 
        defense strategy, the national military strategy, the North 
        American Aerospace Defense Command strategy, and other relevant 
        strategies.
            (2) A specific analysis and metrics supporting such 
        decision.
            (3) An analysis and metrics to show that the elimination or 
        relocation of the flying mission would not negatively affect 
        the homeland defense mission.
            (4) A plan for how the Department of Defense intends to 
        fulfill or continue the mission requirements of the eliminated 
        or relocated flying mission.
            (5) An assessment of the effect of the elimination or 
        relocation on the national defense strategy, the national 
        military strategy, the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
        strategy, and the homeland defense mission.
            (6) An analysis and metrics to show that the elimination or 
        relocation of the flying mission and its secondary and tertiary 
        impacts would not degrade capabilities and readiness of the 
        Joint Force.
            (7) An analysis and metrics to show that the elimination or 
        relocation of the flying mission would not negatively affect 
        the national military airspace system.
    (b) Covered Armed Force.--In this section, the term ``covered Armed 
Force'' means--
            (1) The Army.
            (2) The Navy.
            (3) The Air Force.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

SEC. 3. FLY AMERICA ACT EXCEPTION.

    Section 40118 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding 
at the end the following:
    ``(h) Certain Transportation of Domestic Animals.--
            ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (c), 
        an appropriation to any department, agency, or instrumentality 
        of the United States Government may be used to pay for the 
        transportation of an officer, employee, or member of the 
        uniformed services of any such department, agency, or 
        instrumentality, a dependent of the officer, employee, or 
        member, and in-cabin or accompanying checked baggage, by a 
        foreign air carrier when--
                    ``(A)(i) the transportation is from a place outside 
                the United States to a place in the United States;
                    ``(ii) the transportation is from a place in the 
                United States to a place outside the United States; or
                    ``(iii) the transportation is from a place outside 
                the United States to another place outside the United 
                States; and
                    ``(B) no air carrier holding a certificate under 
                section 41102 is willing and able to transport up to 
                three domestic animals accompanying such officer, 
                employee, member, or dependent.
            ``(2) Limitation.--An amount paid pursuant to paragraph (1) 
        for transportation by a foreign carrier may not be greater than 
        the amount that would otherwise have been paid had the 
        transportation been on an air carrier holding a certificate 
        under section 41102 had that carrier been willing and able to 
        provide such transportation. If the amount that would otherwise 
        have been paid to such an air carrier is less than the cost of 
        transportation on the applicable foreign carrier, the officer, 
        employee, or member may pay the difference of such amount.
            ``(3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `domestic 
        animal' means a dog or a cat.''.

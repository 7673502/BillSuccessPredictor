Task Force with respect to breast cancer screening, mammography, and 
prevention shall be administered by the Secretary involved as if--
            (1) such reference to such current recommendations were a 
        reference to the recommendations of such Task Force with

        this Act, ORR shall brief the Committees on Appropriations of 
        the House of Representatives and the Senate outlining the 
        requirements of ORR for influx facilities including any 
        requirement listed in paragraph (1)(A) that the Secretary has

Secretary shall notify the Committees on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate at least 15 days before operationalizing 
an unlicensed facility, and shall (1) specify whether the facility is 
hard-sided or soft-sided, and (2) provide analysis that indicates that, 
in the absence of the influx facility, the likely outcome is that 
unaccompanied alien children will remain in the custody of the

children who were separated from their parents or legal guardians by 
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) (regardless of whether or not 
such separation was pursuant to an option selected by the children, 
parents, or guardians), subsequently classified as unaccompanied alien 
children, and transferred to the care and custody of ORR during the 
previous month. Each report shall contain the following information:

case manager, therapist, clinical worker, counselor, or social worker 
by such a child during clinical or therapeutic work, and other 
confidential information pertaining to such children, their sponsors, 
or their potential sponsors.
    (d) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or 
restrict the continued implementation of interagency agreements or 
coordination under section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking 
Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) 
pertinent to a child's placement after attaining 18 years of age.

salaries and expenses of employees of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention shall also be available for the primary and secondary 
schooling of eligible dependents of personnel stationed in a U.S. 
territory as defined in section 227 of this Act at costs not in excess

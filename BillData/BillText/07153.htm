                                 AN ACT


 
  To direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit to Congress a 
 plan to modernize the information technology systems of the Veterans 
            Benefits Administration, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans Affairs 
Principles of Benefits Automation Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs 
should increase automation in the processing of claims for benefits 
under the laws administered by the Secretary in accordance with the 
following principles:
            (1) The purpose of automation should be to increase the 
        speed and accuracy of claims processing decisions.
            (2) Automation should be conducted in a manner that 
        enhances the productivity of employees of the Department of 
        Veterans Affairs.
            (3) Automation should be carried out in a manner that 
        achieves greater consistency in the processing and rating of 
        claims by relying on patterns of similar evidence in claim 
        files.
            (4) To the greatest extent possible, automation should be 
        carried out by drawing from information in the possession of 
        the Department, other Government agencies, and claimants for 
        benefits.
            (5) Automation of any claims process or determination 
        should not be end-to-end.
            (6) Employees of the Department should continue to make 
        decisions with respect to the approval of claims and the 
        granting of benefits.
            (7) Automation should not be carried out in a manner that 
        reduces or infringes upon--
                    (A) the due process rights of claimants for 
                benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary; 
                or
                    (B) the duties of the Secretary to assist and 
                notify claimants.
            (8) Automation should be carried out while taking all 
        necessary measures to protect the privacy of claimants and 
        their personally identifiable information.
            (9) Automation of claims processing should not eliminate or 
        reduce the Veterans Benefits Administration workforce.

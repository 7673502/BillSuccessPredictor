                                 A BILL


 
    To criminalize transnational repression, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Transnational Repression Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Transnational repression is not currently codified or 
        defined in United States law.
            (2) The Federal Bureau of Investigation defines 
        transnational repression as foreign government transgression of 
        national borders through physical and digital means to 
        intimidate, silence, coerce, harass, or harm members of 
        diaspora and exile communities. Transnational repression is 
        often used to silence individuals who oppose or are critical of 
        a government, including journalists, human rights defenders, 
        religious or ethnic minority groups, and political opponents. 
        Methods of transnational repression are known to include 
        physical and digital stalking, harassment, computer hacking, 
        criminal threats, assaults, attempted kidnappings, coerced 
        repatriation, and detaining family members in the home country.
            (3) Transnational repression is not limited to physical 
        acts of intimidation and harassment. According to Citizen Lab, 
        ``digital transnational repression'' tools are used to 
        facilitate government reach beyond borders to gain access to 
        social media and email accounts, including through phishing 
        attacks, zero-click spyware hacks, social media page takedowns, 
        SIM card hacks, and fake invitations to conferences. For human 
        rights activists and dissidents, this has a serious impact on 
        their advocacy work and sense of security, even if they have 
        relocated to escape physical intimidation.
            (4) On February 23, 2022, the National Security Division of 
        the Department of Justice launched a ``Strategy for Countering 
        Nation-State Threats'' in order to take a comprehensive, 
        ``whole-of-government'' approach to addressing threats the 
        United States faces from hostile nations, including 
        transnational repression.
            (5) Throughout 2022, the Department of Justice has charged 
        a number of individuals with stalking, harassing, and spying, 
        who allegedly perpetrated transnational repression to silence 
        United States residents who were critics of the People's 
        Republic of China.
            (6) Transnational repression is a growing problem. As of 
        August 2022, Freedom House has documented 735 direct, physical 
        cases of transnational repression that took place between 2014 
        and 2021.
            (7) A total of 85 new incidents of transnational repression 
        were recorded around the globe in 2021. Four governments, 
        Algeria, Belarus, Comoros, and Nigeria, attacked exiles abroad 
        for the first time last year, bringing the total number of 
        states engaged in transnational repression to 36. The number of 
        host countries, or countries where acts of transnational 
        repression took place, rose from 79 to 84, including the United 
        States.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that hostile nations and authoritarian 
regimes have increasingly and aggressively targeted individuals in the 
United States. Agents of these governments have acted outside 
diplomatic channels to threaten, intimidate, harass, surveil, stalk, 
silence, and even plot to physically harm or kidnap persons within U.S. 
borders. Although transnational repression often involves actions that 
are already prohibited by U.S. law, their foreign government backing 
render these activities more egregious than the underlying acts of 
intimidation or harassment alone. Therefore, it is necessary to 
formally define and criminalize transnational repression in Federal 
law, and more actively track and report on instances transnational 
repression in the United States.

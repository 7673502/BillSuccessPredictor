_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To authorize the Director of the National Museum of American History of 
  the Smithsonian Institution to support LGBTQI+ history and women's 
          history education programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``LGBTQI+ and Women's History 
Education Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the New-York Historical Society Museum & 
        Library, only 13 percent of named historical figures in 
        textbooks across the United States are women.
            (2) In 2017, the National Women's History Museum analyzed 
        elementary and secondary education standards in social studies 
        for all 50 States and the District of Columbia and found that 
        approximately 1 woman was mentioned for every 3 men in these 
        standards.
            (3) The Museum also found that 53 percent of the mentions 
        of women's history were included within the context of domestic 
        roles, as opposed to the 20 percent that were included within 
        the context of voting rights and suffrage and 2 percent that 
        were included within the context of being in the workforce.
            (4) Countless studies show that when youth feel seen and 
        affirmed in their curricula, they experience improved academic 
        engagement and achievement. In research the National Women's 
        Law Center conducted in partnership with Latina girls in 2019, 
        the girls reported that when they feel represented in their 
        curricula, they feel a powerful sense of belonging and an 
        emphasized identity of resilience.
            (5) According to the National Women's History Alliance, 
        only 3 States (Illinois, Florida, and Louisiana) have mandated 
        that women's history be taught in elementary, middle, and high 
        schools.
            (6) According to GLSEN, only 7 States (California, 
        Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, and 
        Oregon) have passed legislation in support of an LGBTQI+ 
        inclusive curriculum.
            (7) According to the Museum of disABILITY History, as of 
        2014, 24 States had established disability awareness curriculum 
        for public schools or were in the process of passing 
        legislation to do so.
            (8) In March 2022, Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida signed 
        HB 1557 into law. Commonly known as the ``Don't Say Gay or 
        Trans'' legislation, this law prevents teachers from 
        administering instruction on sexual orientation and gender 
        identity in kindergarten through third grade.
            (9) GLSEN reports that 9 other States in addition to 
        Florida (Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Oklahoma, 
        New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Texas) have recently passed 
        curriculum censorship laws that prohibit honest teaching about 
        race, gender, or LGBTQI+ communities.
            (10) According to the African American Policy Forum, at 
        least 16 States have passed racial and gender equity curriculum 
        prohibitions, and 15 other States are considering them.
            (11) According to Education Week, at least 15 States are 
        considering nearly 30 bills that would affect discussions or 
        interactions with LGBTQI+ youth in schools during the 2021-22 
        legislative session.
            (12) According to GLSEN, 4 States (Louisiana, Mississippi, 
        Oklahoma, and Texas) have ``no promo homo'' laws in place that 
        prevent positive and affirming representations of LGBTQI+ 
        identities in schools.
            (13) LGBTQI+ youth already experience high rates of 
        mistreatment in schools:
                    (A) According to GLSEN's 2019 National School 
                Climate Survey, over 80 percent of LGBTQI+ students 
                ages 13 to 21 report being verbally harassed during any 
                given school year.
                    (B) According to the National Center for 
                Transgender Equality's 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey, 77 
                percent of transgender K-12 students experienced anti-
                transgender mistreatment, including verbal harassment, 
                and physical or sexual assault.
                    (C) According to a 2021 survey, 45 percent of 
                intersex students reported experiencing gender-based 
                harassment or discrimination from teachers or faculty 
                during the 2021 school year.
            (14) Nationally, only 19.4 percent of respondents to 
        GLSEN's 2019 National School Climate Survey said they had been 
        taught any positive representations of LGBTQI+ people, history, 
        or events in their schools.
            (15) Results from GLSEN's 2019 National School Climate 
        Survey also indicate that, compared to students in schools 
        without an LGBTQI+-inclusive curriculum, LGBTQI+ students in 
        schools with an LGBTQI+-inclusive curriculum were less likely 
        to--
                    (A) hear homophobic slurs or negative remarks about 
                transgender people often or frequently;
                    (B) feel unsafe because of their sexuality or 
                gender identity; or
                    (C) miss school because they felt unsafe or 
                uncomfortable.
            (16) Women and LGBTQI+ people--including those of color and 
        those with disabilities--have been and continue to be powerful 
        agents of change in United States history. For example:
                    (A) Black and brown transgender women, including 
                Marsha P. Johnson, Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, Sylvia 
                Rivera, and Storme DeLarverie were prominent leaders 
                and participants of the 1969 protests against unjust 
                police raids of the New York City gay bar, the 
                Stonewall Inn, that ignited the national movement for 
                LGBTQI+ justice.
                    (B) Dr. Margaret Chung, a queer Chinese American 
                woman, advocated for Chinese Americans' and women's 
                right to vote at a time when women, particularly women 
                of color, were denied that right.
                    (C) Judith Ellen ``Judy'' Heumann is an 
                internationally recognized disability rights advocate 
                who played a leading role in the development and 
                implementation of major legislation, including the 
                Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 
                504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans 
                with Disabilities Act, and the Convention on the Rights 
                of Persons with Disabilities.
                    (D) Alice Wong is a queer disabled activist and the 
                founder and director of the Disability Visibility 
                Project who served on the National Council on 
                Disability.
                    (E) Ruby Bridges, a Black civil rights activist, 
                pioneered the school desegregation movement and was 
                among the first Black students to integrate schools in 
                the South at the age of six. Ruby's story, particularly 
                as it was memorialized in her children's book, Ruby 
                Bridges Goes to School: My True Story, continues to 
                inspire girls across the country but was also one of 
                the histories specifically targeted for censorship in 
                States prohibiting honest teachings about race.
            (17) Discrimination on the basis of sex (including sexual 
        orientation and gender identity) compounds with discrimination 
        on the basis of other identities, such as race, national 
        identity, religious background, or disability. Within 
        marginalized groups, compounding layers of discrimination 
        across intersectional identities often results in the most 
        marginalized members of a group being silenced or left out of 
        historical narratives.
            (18) All women, LGBTQI+ people, and those living at the 
        intersection of those identities, deserve to be represented in 
        classrooms across the country in an accurate, unbiased, 
        intersectional, and inclusive manner.

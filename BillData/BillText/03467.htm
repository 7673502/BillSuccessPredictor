                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Public Health Service Act to direct the Secretary of 
 Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers 
      for Disease Control and Prevention, to support research and 
   programmatic efforts that will build on previous research on the 
               effects of adverse childhood experiences.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Data 
Collection for Adverse Childhood Experiences Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Certain negative events, circumstances, or maltreatment 
        to which children may be exposed, known as adverse childhood 
        experiences, are associated with negative health outcomes.
            (2) Childhood psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; 
        household challenges such as violence, substance use, mental 
        illness, separation or divorce, or incarceration of a family 
        member; and emotional or physical neglect have been shown to 
        negatively impact a person's long-term health and well-being.
            (3) Adverse childhood experiences and associated conditions 
        such as living in under-resourced or racially segregated 
        neighborhoods, frequently moving, experiencing food insecurity, 
        and other instability can cause toxic stress, a prolonged 
        activation of the stress-response system.
            (4) Experiencing one or more adverse childhood experiences 
        is associated with higher risks of some of the leading causes 
        of death and disability in the United States.
            (5) More than half of all Americans have experienced one or 
        more adverse childhood experiences.
            (6) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
        recognized adverse childhood experiences as a major public 
        health concern and made it a priority area for focus in the 
        National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
            (7) Further research is needed to better define adverse 
        childhood experiences, understand the causal pathway between 
        adverse childhood experiences and physical health outcomes, and 
        identify protective factors against adverse childhood 
        experiences and their effects, in order to inform and improve 
        current programs and future efforts to promote public health.
            (8) Evidence-based prevention and mitigation strategies to 
        address adverse childhood experiences have been identified, but 
        efforts are needed to facilitate implementation in communities.

SEC. 2. SUPPORTING RESEARCH ON ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

    Part J of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
280b et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 393D (42 U.S.C. 
280b-1f) the following:

``SEC. 393E. SUPPORTING RESEARCH ON PREVENTING OR REMEDIATING ADVERSE 
              CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

    ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the Director of 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, may, in cooperation 
with the States, collect and report data on adverse childhood 
experiences through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the 
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, or other relevant public 
health surveys or questionnaires to contribute to a longitudinal study 
that--
            ``(1) builds on previous literature, including the seminal 
        CDC-Kaiser Permanente Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) 
        Study, on the biology and neuroscience of childhood adversity 
        that establishes the links between adverse childhood 
        experiences and negative outcomes; and
            ``(2) focuses on elements not included in the study 
        referred to in paragraph (1), including--
                    ``(A) the inclusion of a diverse nationally 
                representative sample of participants;
                    ``(B) the strength of the relationship between 
                individual, specific adverse childhood experiences and 
                negative health outcomes;
                    ``(C) the intensity and frequency of adverse 
                childhood experiences;
                    ``(D) the relative strength of particular risk and 
                protective factors; and
                    ``(E) the effect of social, economic, and community 
                conditions on health and well-being.
    ``(b) Technical Assistance.--The Secretary may, directly or through 
awards of grants or contracts to public or nonprofit private entities, 
provide technical assistance with respect to the collection and 
reporting of data as described in subsection (a).
    ``(c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section $10,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2027.''.

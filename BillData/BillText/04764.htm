To prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in schools operated by 
 the Department of Defense Education Activity, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``No CRT for our Military Kids Act''.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR TEACHING CRITICAL RACE 
              THEORY IN SCHOOLS OPERATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
              EDUCATION ACTIVITY.

    (a) Prohibition.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated 
or otherwise made available for any fiscal year for the Department of 
Defense Education Activity may be obligated or expended--
            (1) to teach critical race theory in any school operated by 
        the Activity; or
            (2) to develop or distribute any curriculum that 
        incorporates critical race theory.
    (b) Critical Race Theory Defined.--In this Act, the term ``critical 
race theory'' means any theory that promotes one or more of the 
following:
            (1) That one race is inherently superior to another race.
            (2) That the United States of America is fundamentally or 
        systemically racist.
            (3) That an individual, solely because of the individual's 
        race, is inherently racist or oppressive, whether consciously 
        or unconsciously.
            (4) That an individual should be discriminated against or 
        receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of the 
        individual's race.
            (5) That members of one race cannot and should not attempt 
        to treat others without respect to race.
            (6) That an individual's moral character is necessarily 
        determined by the individual's race.
            (7) That an individual, by virtue of the individual's race, 
        bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other 
        members of the same race.
            (8) That any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, 
        anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account 
        of that individual's race.
            (9) That meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic 
        are racist, or were created by a particular race to oppress 
        another race.
            (10) That any of the founding documents to include the 
        Declaration of Independence, Constitution, or Bill of Rights is 
        inherently racist.
            (11) Any other form of racial scapegoating or racial 
        stereotyping.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

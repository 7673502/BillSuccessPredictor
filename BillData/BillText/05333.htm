        which is controlled by the Taliban, as the official Government 
        of Afghanistan under any circumstances;
            (3) to view the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as a coup 
        d'etat and therefore illegitimate;
            (4) to recognize that individuals designated as terrorists 
        by the United States, such as Sirajuddin Haqqani, will play a 
        key role in the Taliban regime; and

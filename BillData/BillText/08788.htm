SEC. 204. DIPLOMATIC SUPPORT AND SECURITY.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Diplomatic 
Support and Security Act of 2022''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is a United States national security priority that 
        United States Government mission personnel are able to fully 
        execute their duties, including--
                    (A) providing United States citizen services that 
                are often a matter of life and death in insecure 
                places;
                    (B) meeting with foreign officials, including 
                government and nongovernment, civil society, private 
                sector, and members of the press, to advance United 
                States national security priorities; and
                    (C) understanding, engaging, and reporting on 
                foreign political, social, and economic conditions;
            (2) a risk-averse environment that inhibits the execution 
        of these fundamental duties undermines the national security 
        interests of the United States and contributes to the further 
        militarization of United States foreign policy as military and 
        intelligence agencies may experience fewer security 
        restrictions and greater risk tolerance in the wake of security 
        incidents; and
            (3) Congress has a role to play in addressing the 
        challenges of managing risk to the Department and United States 
        Agency for International Development personnel and facilities 
        and helping to balance security and safety concerns with the 
        need for flexibility to carry out their most important duties.
    (c) Encouraging Expeditionary Diplomacy.--
            (1) Purpose.--Subsection (b) of section 102 of the

        institutionalize a culture of learning, and, in the case of 
        apparent gross negligence or breach of duty, authorize the 
        Secretary of State to investigate and pursue accountability for

                paragraphs (5) and (6), respectively; and
                    (C) by inserting after paragraph (3) (as amended) 
                the following:
            ``(4) to support effective risk management strategies and 
        practices that enables the Department of State to pursue its 
        vital goals;''.
            (2) Briefings on embassy security.--Paragraph (1) of 
        section 105(a) of the Diplomatic Security Act (22 U.S.C. 
        4804(a)) is amended--
                    (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by 
                striking ``any plans to open or reopen a high risk, 
                high threat post'' and inserting ``progress towards 
                opening or reopening high risk, high threat posts, and 
                the risk to national security of the continued closure 
                or suspension of operations and remaining barriers to 
                doing so'';
                    (B) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``the type and 
                level of security threats such post could encounter'' 
                and inserting ``the risk to United States foreign 
                policy interests and national security of the post's 
                continued closure or suspension of operations as well 
                as the risks and threats official United States 
                personnel could encounter at such post''; and
                    (C) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``the type 
                and level of security threats such post could 
                encounter, and'' before ``security `tripwires'''.

        (22 U.S.C. 4831) is amended--
                    (A) in the section heading, by striking the heading 
                and inserting ``investigation of serious security 
                incidents'';
                    (B) in subsection (a)--
                            (i) by amending paragraph (1) to read as 
                        follows:
            ``(1) Convening the serious security incident investigation 
        permanent coordinating committee process.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In any case of an incident 
                involving loss of life, serious injury, or significant 
                destruction of property at, or related to, a United

        security procedures operated as intended, and whether such 
        systems, countermeasures, and procedures worked to materially 
        mitigate such attack or were inadequate to mitigate any threat

        Foreign Service Internship Program, to internship programs that

        opportunity to forgo compensation, including if doing so allows 
        such participant to receive college or university curricular 
        credit.

                shall describe the reason why transitioning an unpaid 
                internship program of the Department to an internship 
                program that offers compensation would not be 
                consistent with effective management goals, including 
                any justification for maintaining such unpaid status 
                indefinitely, or any additional authorities or

        shall be informed that their participation in the data

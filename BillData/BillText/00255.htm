                                 A BILL


 
                      To repeal Public Law 107-40.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Repeal of the Authorization for Use 
of Military Force''.

SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDING.

    Congress finds that the Authorization for Use of Military Force 
(Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), signed into law on September 
18, 2001, has been used to justify a broad and open-ended authorization 
for the use of military force and such an interpretation is 
inconsistent with the authority of Congress to declare war and make all 
laws for executing powers vested by the Constitution in the Government 
of the United States.

SEC. 3. REPEAL OF PUBLIC LAW 107-40.

    Effective 240 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 
1541 note) is hereby repealed.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

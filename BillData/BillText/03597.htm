  determined without regard to whether such expenses were reimbursed 
  through certain veterans educational assistance allowances, and for 
                            other purposes.

Public Law 97-35).
    (b) Statute of Limitations.--If refund or credit of any overpayment 
of tax resulting from the application of subsection (a) is prevented at 
any time before the close of the 1-year period beginning on the date of 
the enactment of this Act by the operation of any law or rule of law 
(including res judicata), refund or credit of such overpayment (to the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``African Diaspora Heritage Month Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the African diaspora population in the United States 
        has grown significantly in recent years, with the number of 
        African immigrants growing at a rate of almost 246 percent from 
        2000 to 2019;
            (2) the African diaspora community is one of the most 
        diverse communities in the United States, inclusive of people 
        who speak multiple languages, whose rich heritage comes from 
        all across the African continent, and whose members practice 
        various faiths;
            (3) during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, a 
        significant number of enslaved people from Africa were brought 
        to the United States;
            (4) immigrants of African origin boast some of the highest 
        educational achievements of any immigrant group;
            (5) African diaspora households contribute billions of 
        dollars to the economy of the United States, with an estimated 
        $10,100,000,000 in Federal taxes, $4,700,000,000 in State and 
        local taxes, and a spending power of more than $40,300,000,000 
        in 2015;
            (6) Sub-Saharan African immigrants living in the United 
        States, Europe, and elsewhere sent back $46,000,000,000 in 
        remittances to the continent of Africa in 2021;
            (7) Government agencies, including the International 
        Development Finance Corporation, the Department of Commerce, 
        the Department of the Treasury, and the United States Trade 
        Representative are critical to investments and enduring mutual 
        partnerships between the United States and African nations;
            (8) in 2019, through the African Growth and Opportunity Act 
        (19 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.), the United States imported 
        $8,400,000,000 in goods, up 2.4 percent as compared to 2001;
            (9) Prosper Africa and other similar Government initiatives 
        are critical to building and strengthening ties between the 
        United States and African businesses;
            (10) the total two-way goods trade with Sub-Saharan Africa 
        totaled $44,900,000,000 in 2021, a 22 percent increase from 
        $36,800,000,000 in 2019;
            (11) the African diaspora plays an invaluable role in 
        shaping Government policy;
            (12) members of the African diaspora have an invaluable 
        understanding of cross-cultural engagement between the United 
        States and Africa, existing relations and networks on the 
        African continent, and can support efforts to facilitate 
        stronger ties between the United States and Africa;
            (13) the United States is committed to strengthening the 
        government-to-government relationships between the United 
        States and countries throughout the African continent;
            (14) Congress strongly supports the United States hosting a 
        second United States-Africa Leaders Summit in December 2022, 
        and urges collaboration between the Government and the African 
        diaspora community in the United States in advance, during, and 
        after the Summit as an opportunity to strengthen ties between 
        the United States and African nations;
            (15) the African diaspora harbors a deep commitment to 
        family and community, an enduring work ethic, and a 
        perseverance to succeed and contribute to the society of the 
        United States; and
            (16) all members of the African diaspora in the United 
        States deserve access to Federal resources and a voice in the 
        Government of the United States.

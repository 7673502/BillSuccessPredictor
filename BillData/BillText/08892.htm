SEC. 2. OUTREACH AND REPORT ON ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE

availability of, and limitations on the imposition of financial 
requirements or treatment limitations for, benefits for mental health 
and substance use disorder crisis services under such plans and 
coverages. Such outreach shall emphasize the benefits of such mental 
health and substance use disorder crisis services, including improved

with accessing such mental health and substance use disorder crisis 
services.

Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury shall submit to

        crisis services under a group health plan or group or 
        individual health insurance coverage, including--
                    (A) which mental health and substance use disorder 
                services are covered as crisis services;
                    (B) the type of health care providers furnishing 
                such services; and
                    (C) common reimbursement approaches and billing 
                codes used with respect to such services;
            (2) barriers to individuals covered under a group health 
        plan or group or individual health insurance coverage accessing 
        mental health and substance use disorder crisis services, 
        including geographic barriers and barriers caused by a limited 
        availability of such mental health and substance use disorder 
        crisis services in certain service areas; and
            (3) issues relating to unexpected bills such individuals 
        may receive after being furnished such services in certain 
        service settings.
    (c) Funding.--In addition to amounts otherwise available for such 
purposes, there is appropriated $20,000,000, to remain available until 
expended, for purposes of carrying out this section.

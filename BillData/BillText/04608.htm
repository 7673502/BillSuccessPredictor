    (a) In General.--Section 1400Z-1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Designation of Zones Every 10 Years.--
            ``(1) Second round of designations.--Concurrently with the 
        application of the provisions of this section without regard to 
        this subsection, as of January 1, 2027, the provisions of this 
        section shall be reapplied--
                    ``(A) as though such provisions were enacted on 
                such date, and
                    ``(B) by substituting such date for--
                            ``(i) `the date of the enactment of Public 
                        Law 115-97' in subsection (b)(3), and
                            ``(ii) `the date of the enactment of the 
                        Tax Cuts and Jobs Act' in subsection (c)(2)(B).
            ``(2) Subsequent rounds of designations.--Paragraph (1) 
        shall be reapplied as of the first date that no designation of 
        a qualified opportunity zone from the preceding round of 
        designations remains in effect by reason of the application of 
        subsection (f) to such round of designations.
            ``(3) Redesignations permitted.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to prevent the designation of a tract as a 
        qualified opportunity zone merely because such tract was 
        previously designated as such a zone if such tract otherwise 
        meets the requirements for such designation as of the time of 
        such subsequent designation.''.
    (b) Application Rules for Investment in Opportunity Zones.--Section 
1400Z-2 of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subsection:
    ``(g) Application for Gains in Subsequent Rounds of Designations.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of gain from the sale or 
        exchange of property after December 31, 2026--
                    ``(A) the taxpayer may make an election under 
                subsection (a) with respect to such sale or exchange, 
                and
                    ``(B) subsections (a)(2)(B) and (b)(1)(B) shall be 
                applied by substituting `the applicable date' for 
                `December 31, 2026'.
            ``(2) Applicable date.--For purposes of paragraph (1), the 
        applicable date with respect to any sale or exchange shall be--

                    ``(B) in the case of any sale or exchange after the 
                most recently past date determined under this 
                paragraph, the December 31 of the seventh year 
                beginning after each instance paragraph (1) of section 
                1400Z-1(g) is reapplied by reason of paragraph (2) 
                thereof.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall take 
effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.

To posthumously award a Congressional Gold Medal to Aretha Franklin in 
recognition of her contributions of outstanding artistic and historical 
             significance to culture in the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Aretha Franklin Congressional Gold 
Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Aretha Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, in Memphis, 
        Tennessee, and died peacefully at her home in Detroit, 
        Michigan, surrounded by family and loved ones on August 16, 
        2018.
            (2) Aretha Franklin's musical talents have influenced 
        generations of musicians and political leaders, creating a 
        legacy that spans an incredible 6 decades.
            (3) Aretha Franklin, dubbed the ``Queen of Soul'', was the 
        first woman ever inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, 
        was a 2005 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and 
        was a 1999 recipient of the National Medal of Arts and 
        Humanities Award, among other accolades.
            (4) Aretha Franklin's music served as a 1960s call to 
        action that inspired thousands to join civil rights movements 
        and still resonates across these movements today.
            (5) Aretha Franklin's contributions go beyond music and 
        arts.
            (6) Aretha Franklin was also a philanthropist who supported 
        causes that advanced civil rights, human health, and gender 
        equality.
            (7) Aretha Franklin's talents instilled hope, uplifted 
        generations, and changed the lives of millions of people across 
        the globe.
            (8) The City of Detroit shaped Aretha's life and music, as 
        her father and church introduced her to local Motown artists.
            (9) In return, Aretha made countless contributions to the 
        City of Detroit, and few people have played a greater role in 
        shaping the Nation's culturally and socially relevant 
        discography than Aretha Franklin.

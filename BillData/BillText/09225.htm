        `immigration benefit application' means any application, 
        petition, or request to confer, certify, change, adjust, or

SEC. 6. IMMIGRATION FUNCTIONS.

    (a) In General.--Section 478 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
(6 U.S.C. 298) is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 478. TIMELY PROVISION OF IMMIGRATION SERVICES.

    ``(a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            ``(1) the quality and efficiency of immigration services 
        rendered by the Federal Government should be improved after the 
        transfers made by this subtitle take effect;
            ``(2) the Secretary of Homeland Security should undertake 
        efforts to guarantee that concerns regarding the quality and 
        efficiency of immigration services are addressed after such 
        effective date; and
            ``(3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should not assign 
        a processing time goal (as such term is defined in section 203 
        of the Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act 
        of 2000 (8 U.S.C. 1572)) that is longer than a maximum 
        processing timeframe set forth in section 202 of the 
        Immigration Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 
        2000 (8 U.S.C. 1571), except that the processing time goal for 
        employment authorization documents should not be longer than 90 
        days.
    ``(b) Case Inquiry Escalation.--The Secretary shall make publicly 
available on the website of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services 
the process by which a person with a pending immigration benefit 
application (as such term is defined in section 203 of the Immigration 
Services and Infrastructure Improvements Act of 2000 (8 U.S.C. 1572)) 
may inquire about such application after the processing time goal (as 
such term is defined in such section 203) or the median processing time 
for such type of immigration benefit application, whichever is sooner. 
The process developed pursuant to this subsection shall include--
            ``(1) a requirement that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration 
        Services provides a substantive response to each person who 
        inquires about an immigration benefit application pursuant to 
        such process; and
            ``(2) an additional process for a person to escalate such 
        an inquiry in the case that a substantive response described in 
        paragraph (1) has not been provided.''.
    (b) Clerical Amendment.--Section 1(b) of the Homeland Security Act 
of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101 note) is amended in the table of contents by 
striking the item relating to section 478 and inserting the following:

``Sec. 478. Timely provision of immigration services.''.

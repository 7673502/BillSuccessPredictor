    It is the sense of Congress that in sentencing a defendant for a 
covered political protest offense (as such term is defined in section 
3142 of title 18, United States Code), a judge should impose a sentence 
that is consistent with the minimum sentence provided by the guideline 
range applicable to the defendant.

of any individual for the commission of a criminal offense in the

division embracing that individual's primary residence.

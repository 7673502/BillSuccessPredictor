_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 to require 
abortion providers to notify the national human trafficking hotline of 
            victims of trafficking, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Stopping Traffickers and Their 
Accomplices Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Slavery and involuntary servitude are incompatible with 
        American society and law.
            (2) The 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution 
        abolished legal slavery and involuntary servitude in the United 
        States.
            (3) Despite slavery being abolished in 1865, modern forms 
        of slavery still exist throughout the United States.
            (4) Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans and 
        immigrants are coerced into commercial sex acts against their 
        will.
            (5) In addition to sexual exploitation, victims of 
        trafficking suffer repeated physical, mental, and emotional 
        abuse at the hands of their traffickers.
            (6) Abortion providers and facilities aid sex traffickers 
        by turning a blind eye to the plight of abused women.
            (7) The Department of State's 2017 Trafficking in Persons 
        Report indicated that sex traffickers coerce women into 
        receiving abortions against their will.
            (8) Research conducted by Laura J. Lederer and Christopher 
        A. Wetzel, entitled ``The Health Consequences of Sex 
        Trafficking and Their Implications for Identifying Victims in 
        Healthcare Facilities'' published in the Annals of Health Law 
        Journal, indicated that 71 percent of women coerced into 
        commercial sex acts reported at least one pregnancy and 21 
        percent reported five or more pregnancies while trafficked (23 
        Annals Health L. 61 (2014)).
            (9) Lederer and Wetzel's research found that almost a third 
        of women trafficked reported underwent numerous abortions as 
        victims of trafficking. More than half of respondents answered 
        that their abortion while a victim of sex trafficking was a 
        result of coercion. One victim of sex trafficking recounted, 
        ``[in most of my six abortions,] I was under serious pressure 
        from my pimps to abort the babies''.
            (10) A moral obligation exists to report suspected 
        instances of sex trafficking to authorities.
            (11) Section 2 of the 13th Amendment empowers Congress to 
        enact appropriate legislation to combat all forms of slavery 
        and involuntary servitude, including forced sex trafficking.

SEC. 3. COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

    Section 114 of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 
(34 U.S.C. 20709) is amended by adding at the end the following:

                national human trafficking hotline if the provider has 
                a reasonable suspicion that the patient is a victim of 
                trafficking.
                    ``(B) Report to attorney general and local law

                and Human Services shall notify the Attorney General of

                more than 6 months, or both.
            ``(2) Training.--
                    ``(A) Availability.--The Secretary of Health and

                protocols that the abortion provider has in place to 
                identify and assist victims of trafficking.
                    ``(C) Penalty.--An abortion provider who fails to 
                comply with subparagraph (B) shall be subject to a fine 
                in an amount of $1,000 per day of noncompliance.
            ``(3) Rules of construction.--

                    ``(B) No right to abortion.--Nothing in this

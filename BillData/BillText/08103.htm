                        agricultural systems by integrating 
                        experiential, hands-on learning to enhance the

            (1) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(9) Aeroponic tower system.--The term `aeroponic tower 
        system' means a hydroponic growing system in which plants are 
        grown vertically in an air-based environment where they receive 
        regular misting with water and dissolved nutrients on their 
        stems and roots during the production cycle.
            ``(10) Agricultural technology and engineering system.--The 
        term `agricultural technology and engineering system' means a 
        system that includes at least one of the following:
                    ``(A) Nutrient technique film system.
                    ``(B) Vine crop system.
                    ``(C) Aeroponic tower system.
                    ``(D) Other systems as determined by the Secretary 
                in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture.
            ``(11) Aquaponic agriculture system.--The term `aquaponic 
        agriculture system' means a plant production system in which 
        the waste produced from farmed fish or other aquatic animals 
        supplies nutrients for plants grown hydroponically, which in 
        turn purifies the water.
            ``(12) Hydroponic agriculture system.--The term `hydroponic 
        agriculture system' means a plant production system in which 
        plants are grown in a soil-less environment where nutrients are 
        provided by the application of nutrient solutions.
            ``(13) Nutrient technique film system.--The term `nutrient 
        technique film system' means a hydroponic growing system in 
        which a shallow stream of water containing dissolved nutrients 
        is re-circulated past the bare roots of plants in channels 
        during the production cycle.
            ``(14) Vine crop system.--The term `vine crop system' means 
        a hydroponic growing system in which vine crops and other tall 
        fruiting crops (including tomatoes) are grown vertically to 
        maximize the growing space using recirculating water and 
        dissolved nutrients.''; and
            (2) by reordering paragraphs (1) through (8) and the 
        paragraphs added by paragraph (1) of this subsection in 
        alphabetical order, based on the headings of such paragraphs,

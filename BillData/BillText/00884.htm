Security, and the heads of such other Federal departments or agencies 
as the Secretary of Transportation considers appropriate, shall develop 
a national aviation preparedness plan for communicable disease 
outbreaks.
    (b) Contents of Plan.--The plan developed under subsection (a) 
shall, at a minimum--
            (1) provide airports and air carriers with an adaptable and 
        scalable framework with which to align the individual plans, 
        including the emergency response plans, of such airports and 
        air carriers and provide guidance as to each individual plan;
            (2) improve coordination among airports, air carriers, U.S. 
        Customs and Border Protection, the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention, other appropriate Federal entities, and State 
        and local governments and health agencies with respect to 
        preparing for and responding to communicable disease outbreaks;
            (3) to the extent practicable, improve coordination among 
        relevant international entities;
            (4) create a process to identify appropriate personal 
        protective equipment, if any, for covered employees to reduce 
        the likelihood of exposure to a covered communicable disease, 
        and thereafter issue recommendations for the equipage of such 
        employees;
            (5) create a process to identify appropriate techniques, 
        strategies, and protective infrastructure, if any, for the 
        cleaning, disinfecting, and sanitization of aircraft and 
        enclosed facilities owned, operated, or used by an air carrier 
        or airport, and thereafter issue recommendations pertaining to 
        such techniques, strategies, and protective infrastructure;
            (6) identify and assign Federal agency roles in the 
        deployment of emerging and existing technologies and solutions 
        to reduce covered communicable diseases in the aviation 
        ecosystem;
            (7) clearly delineate the responsibilities of the sponsors 
        and operators of airports, air carriers, and Federal agencies 
        in responding to a covered communicable disease;
            (8) incorporate, as appropriate, the recommendations made 
        by the Comptroller General of the United States to the 
        Secretary of Transportation contained in the report titled 
        ``Air Travel and Communicable Diseases: Comprehensive Federal 
        Plan Needed for U.S. Aviation System's Preparedness'', issued 
        in December 2015 (GAO-16-127);
            (9) consider the latest peer-reviewed scientific studies 
        that address communicable disease with respect to air 
        transportation; and
            (10) consider funding constraints.
    (c) Consultation.--When developing the plan under subsection (a), 
the Secretary of Transportation shall consult with aviation industry 
and labor stakeholders, including representatives of--

        representatives, and air carrier maintenance, repair, and 
        overhaul workers;
            (4) the labor organization certified under section 7111 of 
        title 5, United States Code, as the exclusive bargaining

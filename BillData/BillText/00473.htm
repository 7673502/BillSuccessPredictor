To require a review of Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler 
                   programs, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Trusted Traveler Reconsideration and 
Restoration Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.

    Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a 
review of Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler programs. 
Such review shall examine the following:
            (1) The extent to which the Department of Homeland Security 
        tracks data and monitors trends related to trusted traveler 
        programs, including root causes for identity-matching errors 
        resulting in an individual's enrollment in a trusted traveler 
        program being reinstated.
            (2) Whether the Department coordinates with the heads of 
        other relevant Federal, State, local, Tribal, or territorial 
        entities regarding redress procedures for disqualifying 
        offenses not covered by the Department's own redress processes 
        but which offenses impact an individual's enrollment in a 
        trusted traveler program.
            (3) How the Department may improve individuals' access to 
        reconsideration procedures regarding a disqualifying offense 
        for enrollment in a trusted traveler program that requires the 
        involvement of any other Federal, State, local, Tribal, or 
        territorial entity.
            (4) The extent to which travelers are informed about 
        reconsideration procedures regarding enrollment in a trusted 
        traveler program.

SEC. 3. ENROLLMENT REDRESS.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall, with respect to an individual whose enrollment 
in a trusted traveler program was revoked in error extend by an amount 
of time equal to the period of revocation the period of active 
enrollment in such a program upon re-enrollment in such a program by 
such an individual.

                                 A BILL


 
    To require a notification relating to the nationally determined 
contribution of the United States prior to any submission with respect 
 to such contribution under article 4 of the Paris Agreement, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Climate Action and 
American Competitiveness Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The United States is a world leader in addressing 
        climate change risks through private sector-led innovation and 
        technological advancement.
            (2) The United States Energy Information Administration 
        estimates that United States energy-related carbon dioxide 
        emissions, since peaking in 2007, have declined by an average 
        of 1.3 percent per year, starting well before the United States 
        became a party to the Paris Agreement. This decline brought 
        greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest levels since 1992.
            (3) Nuclear energy accounts for nine of the ten highest-
        generating power plants in the United States, and produces one-
        third the carbon dioxide emissions of current solar 
        technologies.
            (4) According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), in 
        terms of carbon dioxide emissions, the United States has 
        conducted ``the largest absolute decline among all countries 
        since 2000''.
            (5) President Obama unilaterally joined the Paris Agreement 
        without involving Congress, without consulting outside 
        stakeholders such as energy companies, and without conducting a 
        cost-benefit analysis, including an analysis of how a United 
        States nationally determined contribution (NDC) would impact 
        competitiveness with countries like the People's Republic of 
        China (PRC) that threaten United States national and economic 
        security.
            (6) A report prepared by NERA Economic Consulting in 2017 
        found that meeting the commitments President Obama made as part 
        of the Paris Agreement could reduce the United States gross 
        domestic product by $250,000,000,000 and eliminate 2,700,000 
        jobs by 2025.
            (7) Despite being the world's second largest economy, the 
        PRC was permitted to be classified as a ``developing country'' 
        for purposes of the Paris Agreement and abused this 
        classification when making its NDC under the Paris Agreement.
            (8) The PRC is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse 
        gases, and according to the NDC submitted by the Chinese 
        Communist Party, it will continue raising emissions until 2030.
            (9) On September 22, 2020, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping 
        announced his intention for China to become carbon neutral by 
        2060, a full decade later than the 2050 target date committed 
        to by other major economies.
            (10) According to the IEA, coal-fired power plants were the 
        single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in 2018. China has 
        dedicated over $50,000,000,000 through the Belt and Road 
        Initiative to developing coal projects across 150 countries in 
        the past seven years, signaling a lack of genuine intent to 
        combat climate change.
            (11) During Paris negotiations, then-Secretary of State 
        John Kerry acknowledged that even if all the developed world, 
        which in this context does not include China, cut carbon 
        dioxide emissions to zero, it would not offset the emissions 
        coming from the rest of the globe.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL NOTIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PARIS AGREEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The President shall notify Congress not fewer than 
30 days prior to submitting, pursuant to article 4 of the Paris

        fossil fuel, and renewable technologies, to achieve the NDC.
            (5) A description of how the NDC will promote availability

        trading partners.
            (6) An analysis of the NDCs submitted with respect to the 
        Paris Agreement by the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China and the Government of the Russian Federation, the 
        anticipated effects on their respective domestic carbon dioxide 
        emissions, and the anticipated effects on their respective 
        global competitiveness.
            (7) A description of how the NDC will support United States 
        efforts to counter malign Chinese and Russian influence and

``Congressional Review Act'').
                                 &lt;all&gt;

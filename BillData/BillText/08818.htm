                           related injuries.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wind Safety Standard Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. OSHA SAFETY STANDARD FOR PROTECTION FROM HIGH WINDS.

    (a) Proposed Standard.--Not later than 2 years after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall, pursuant to 
section 6(b) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 
U.S.C. 655(b)), promulgate a proposed standard on prevention of 
workplace injury from high winds.
    (b) Final Standard.--Not later than 42 months after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall promulgate a final standard 
on prevention of workplace injury from high winds that shall--
            (1) provide no less protection than the most protective 
        wind protection standard adopted by a State plan that has been 
        approved by the Secretary under section 18 of the Occupational 
        Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 667) and, at a 
        minimum, include the requirements described in section 4; and
            (2) be effective and enforceable in the same manner and to 
        the same extent as any standard promulgated under section 6(b) 
        of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 
        655(b)).
    (c) Interim Final Standard.--
            (1) In general.--If the proposed standard described in 
        subsection (a) is not promulgated not later than 2 years after 
        the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor shall 
        promulgate an interim final standard on prevention of workplace 
        injury from high winds not later than 2 years and 60 days after 
        such date of enactment--
                    (A) to require covered employers to develop and 
                implement a comprehensive workplace wind protection 
                plan to protect covered employees from excessive winds 
                that may lead to wind-related workplace injuries; and
                    (B) that shall, at a minimum--
                            (i) provide no less protection than the 
                        most protective wind protection standard 
                        adopted by a State plan that has been approved 
                        by the Secretary under section 18 of the

        final standard under this subsection:
                    (A) The requirements applicable to occupational 
                safety and health standards under section 6(b) of the

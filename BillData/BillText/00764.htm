Children and Teachers Act'' or the ``Keep Our PACT Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Children are our Nation's future and greatest treasure.
            (2) A high-quality education is the surest way for every 
        child to reach his or her full potential.
            (3) The coronavirus pandemic has amplified the deep funding 
        inequities that exist in our education system.
            (4) Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary 
        Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) helps address 
        inequity in education in school districts across the United 
        States to provide a high-quality education to every student.
            (5) The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 
        U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) guarantees all children with disabilities 
        a first-rate education.
            (6) The amendments made to such Act by the Individuals with 
        Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-
        446; 118 Stat. 2647) committed Congress to providing 40 percent 
        of the national current average per-pupil expenditure for 
        students with disabilities.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Mechanical Insulation Act''.

SEC. 2. INSTALLATION OF MECHANICAL INSULATION PROPERTY AS AN ENERGY OR 
              WATER EFFICIENCY MEASURE IN FEDERAL BUILDINGS.

    (a) Definition of Mechanical Insulation Property.--Section 
543(f)(1) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
8253(f)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(I) Mechanical insulation property.--The term 
                `mechanical insulation property' means insulation 
                materials, facings, and accessory products installed in 
                connection to such insulation materials--
                            ``(i) placed in service--
                                    ``(I) in connection with a 
                                mechanical system; and

                            ``(ii) which result in a reduction in 
                        energy loss from the mechanical system.''.
    (b) Comprehensive Energy and Water Evaluations.--Section 
543(f)(3)(A) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 
8253(f)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting ``, including identification of 
energy- and water-saving measures (including installation of mechanical 
insulation property, if applicable),'' after ``a comprehensive energy 
and water evaluation''.
    (c) Qualified Installation of Mechanical Insulation Property.--
Section 543(f)(4) of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 
U.S.C. 8253(f)(4)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(C) Qualified installation of mechanical 
                insulation property.--For each measure implemented 
                under this paragraph that involves installation of 
                mechanical insulation property, such installation shall 
                be performed by an individual who has completed an

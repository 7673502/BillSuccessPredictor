(a), the Director of NIH may prioritize the issuance of awards to 
applicants who--
            ``(1) are individual researchers presenting qualifying 
        applications and representing populations that have been 
        historically underrepresented in pediatric medical research, 
        including women and underrepresented racial minorities; or
            ``(2) are institutions of higher education that are 
        eligible to receive funds under part A or B of title III of the

        higher education to offer programs to support early-career 
        pediatric researchers.
    ``(c) Priority Research Topic Areas.--In carrying out subsection 
(a), the Director of NIH, in consultation with the Director of the

Development and the directors of other national research institutes and 
national centers that participate within the Trans-NIH Pediatric 
Research Consortium, shall--
            ``(1) establish priority research topic areas, informed by 
        external stakeholders, including research institutions, 
        research societies, patient organizations, and industry; and

        pediatric research topic areas with current and future 
        priorities of the National Institutes of Health, including--

        to help such recipients reach a state of research independence, 
        including conferences and other meeting participation.
    ``(e) Supplement, Not Supplant.--Awards made under this section

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    Not later than 30 days after the enactment of this Act, the rate of 
basic pay for a member of the Armed Forces under section 203 of title 
37, United States Code, shall equal or exceed $31,200.

              SERVICE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO CARRY OUT 
              INCREASE OF MINIMUM RATE OF BASIC PAY.

    The unobligated balance of amounts made available to the Internal

Act and ending on the date on which the Secretary of Defense certifies 
to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that such Secretary has 
implemented section 1, the Internal Revenue Service may not hire any

employees employed by the Internal Revenue Service exceeding the number 
of such employees so employed immediately before such period.

To direct the Federal Communications Commission to collect and maintain 
data on the growth in the use of Internet of Things devices and devices 
    that use 5G mobile networks in order to determine the amount of 
 electromagnetic spectrum required to meet the demand created by such 
                      use, and for other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Internet of Things device usage is a critical component 
        of the United States economy;
            (2) Internet of Things device usage will continue to grow 
        exponentially, and United States infrastructure needs to be 
        prepared for that growth;
            (3) in order for the Federal Government to properly address 
        spectrum requirements, Congress needs to understand the full 
        scope of future spectrum demand; and
            (4) the United States should further prepare its 
        infrastructure with comprehensive spectrum planning.

SEC. 3. TRACKING OF GROWTH OF INTERNET OF THINGS AND 5G DEVICES BY FCC.

    (a) Collection and Maintenance of Data.--The Commission shall 
collect and maintain data on the growth in the use of Internet of

date of the enactment of this Act, and not less frequently than every 2 
years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to Congress a report on 
the data collected and maintained under subsection (a). Such report 
shall contain--
            (1) a determination by the Commission of the amount of 
        electromagnetic spectrum required to meet the demand created by 
        Internet of Things devices and devices that use 5G mobile 
        networks and whether sufficient spectrum is available as of the 
        date of such report to meet such demand; and
            (2) a determination by the Commission of--
                    (A) whether any growth is anticipated in the use of 
                Internet of Things devices or devices that use 5G 
                mobile networks; and
                    (B) if such growth is anticipated, the amount of 
                spectrum needed to meet the future demand created by

``SEC. 359A. TARIFF RATE QUOTAS.

    ``(a) In General.--At the beginning of each quota year, the

refined sugar at a level that is not less than the minimum level 
necessary to comply with obligations under international trade 
agreements that Congress has approved.
    ``(b) Adjustment.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (a), the Secretary 
        shall adjust the tariff-rate quotas for raw cane sugar and 
        refined sugar to provide adequate supplies of sugar at 
        reasonable prices in the domestic market.
            ``(2) Ending stocks.--Subject to paragraphs (1) and (3), 
        the Secretary shall establish and adjust tariff-rate quotas so 
        that the ratio of sugar stocks to total sugar use at the end of 
        each quota year shall be approximately 15.5 percent.

        forfeitures.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary may establish a 
                different target percentage for the ratio of ending 
                stocks to total use described in paragraph (2) if the 
                Secretary determines the different target percentage is 
                necessary to prevent--
                            ``(i) unreasonably high prices; or
                            ``(ii) forfeitures of sugar pledged as 
                        collateral for a loan under section 156 of the 
                        Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act 
                        of 1996 (7 U.S.C. 7272).
                    ``(B) Announcement.--The Secretary shall publicly 
                announce an establishment of a target percentage under 
                this paragraph.
            ``(4) Considerations.--In establishing tariff-rate quotas 
        under subsection (a) and making adjustments under this 
        subsection, the Secretary shall consider the impact of the 
        quotas on consumers, workers, businesses (including small 
        businesses), and agricultural producers.
    ``(c) Temporary Transfer of Quotas.--
            ``(1) In general.--To promote the full use of the tariff-
        rate quotas for raw cane sugar and refined sugar established or 
        adjusted under subsection (a) or (b), respectively, the 
        Secretary shall promulgate regulations that provide that a 
        country that has been allocated a share of the quotas may 
        temporarily transfer all or part of the share to another 
        country that has also been allocated a share of the quotas.
            ``(2) Transfers voluntary.--A transfer under this 
        subsection shall be valid only on voluntary agreement between 
        the transferor and the transferee, consistent with procedures 
        established by the Secretary.
            ``(3) Transfers temporary.--
                    ``(A) In general.--A transfer under this subsection 
                shall be valid only for the duration of the quota year 
                during which the transfer is made.
                    ``(B) Following quota year.--No transfer under this 
                subsection shall affect the share of the quota 
                allocated to the transferor or transferee for the 
                following quota year.''.

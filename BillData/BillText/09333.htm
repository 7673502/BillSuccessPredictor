                not later than 6 months after the Commission receives 
                the petition, unless the Commission finds that an 
                extension of the 6-month period is necessary to 
                determine whether the requirements are economically 
                burdensome.''.

                access to video programming that is functionally 
                equivalent to the access provided by the audio track, 
                with minimum thresholds that are neutral to different

                easily discoverable through navigation devices, 
                apparatuses, applications, and other methods on which 
                such programming is published or exhibited or made 
                available.

                    (I) A recommendation for defining metrics to be 
                used for measuring the quality of audio description as 
                necessary to afford access to video programming that is 
                functionally equivalent to the access provided 
                visually.
                    (J) An identification of easy-to-use authoring 
                tools that can be used by viewers to add audio

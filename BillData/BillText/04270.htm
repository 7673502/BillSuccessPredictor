SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Abandoned Well Remediation Research 
and Development Act''.

SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2005.

    The Energy Policy Act of 2005 is amended--

              PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Establishment.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
enactment of the Abandoned Well Remediation Research and Development 
Act, the Secretary of Energy shall, in coordination with relevant 
Federal and state agencies and entities, establish a research, 
development, and demonstration program to improve--
            ``(1) data collection on the location of abandoned wells;
            ``(2) the plugging, remediation, reclamation, and 
        repurposing of abandoned wells; and

        impacts of documented and undocumented abandoned wells.
    ``(b) Activities.--The research, development, and demonstration 
under subsection (a) shall include activities to improve--
            ``(1) remote sensor capabilities, LiDAR capabilities, 
        optical gas imaging, magnetic survey technology, and any other 
        technologies relevant to the efficient identification of 
        abandoned wells;
            ``(2) understanding of how certain parameters of abandoned 
        wells affect methane emission rates of such wells, including 
        paramaters such as well age, well depth, geology, construction, 
        case material, and geographic region;
            ``(3) the efficiency and cost-efficacy of processes for 
        plugging, remediating, reclaiming, and repurposing abandoned

                alternative uses, including geothermal power production 
                or carbon capture, utilization, and storage; and
            ``(4) understanding of the impacts of abandoned wells on 
        groundwater quality and contamination.
    ``(c) Coordination.--In carrying out the program established in 
(a), the Secretary shall ensure coordination of these activities with 
institutions of higher education, the Department of Energy National 
Laboratories, and the private sector.
    ``(d) Abandoned Well Defined.--In this section, the term `abandoned

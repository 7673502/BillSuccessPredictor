                                 A BILL


 
  To conserve global bear populations by prohibiting the importation, 
exportation, and interstate trade of bear viscera and items, products, 
or substances containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear 
                    viscera, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown 
        bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant 
        panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on appendix I or II 
        of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species 
        of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087; TIAS 8249) (referred to 
        in this section as ``CITES'');
            (2) Article XIV of CITES provides that Parties to CITES may 
        adopt stricter domestic measures regarding the conditions for 
        trade, taking, possession, or transport of species listed on 
        appendix I or II, and the Parties to CITES adopted a resolution 
        in 1997 (Conf. 10.8) urging the Parties to take immediate 
        action to demonstrably reduce the illegal trade in bear parts;
            (3) thousands of bears in Asia are cruelly confined in 
        small cages to be milked for their bile, and the wild Asian 
        bear population has declined significantly in recent years, as 
        a result of habitat loss and poaching due to a strong demand 
        for bear viscera used in traditional medicines and cosmetics;
            (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed 
        that American bears have been poached for their viscera;
            (5) while most American black bear populations are 
        generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could 
        stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the 
        demand for bear viscera increases; and
            (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United 
        States and exportation from the United States, as well as 
        prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera and 
        products containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, 
        bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the United States 
        does not contribute to the decline of any bear population as a 
        result of the commercial trade in bear viscera.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term viability of the 
world's 8 bear species by--
            (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear 
        viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as 
        containing, bear viscera;
            (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to 
        eliminate such trade; and
            (3) ensuring that adequate Federal legislation exists with 
        respect to domestic trade in bear viscera and products 
        containing, or labeled or advertised as containing, bear 
        viscera.

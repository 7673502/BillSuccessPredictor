                                 A BILL


 
  To amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 to clarify the 
  authority of States to remove noncitizens from voting rolls and to 
   require States to maintain separate voter registration lists for 
                  noncitizens, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Noncitizens: Outlawed from Voting in 
Our Trusted Elections Act of 2022'' or the ``NO VOTE for Noncitizens 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Every eligible person who wishes to cast a ballot in a 
        Federal election must be permitted to do so according to law, 
        and their ballot must be examined according to law, and, if it 
        meets all lawful requirements, counted.
            (2) Congress has long required States to maintain Federal 
        voter registration lists in a manner that promotes voter 
        confidence.
            (3) The changes included herein are not intended to be an 
        expansion of Federal power but rather a clarification of State 
        authority.
            (4) The Fifteenth Amendment, the Nineteenth Amendment, the 
        Twenty-Fourth Amendment, and the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, among 
        other references, make clear that the Constitution prohibits 
        voting by noncitizens in Federal elections.
            (5) Congress has the constitutional authority, including 
        under the aforementioned amendments, to pass statutes 
        preventing noncitizens from voting in Federal elections, and 
        did so with the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
        Responsibility Act of 1996.
            (6) Congress may further exercise its constitutional 
        authority to ensure the Constitution's prohibition on 
        noncitizen voting in Federal elections is upheld.
            (7) Since the Constitution prohibits noncitizens from 
        voting in Federal elections, such ineligible persons must not 
        be permitted to be placed on Federal voter registration lists.
            (8) Improper placement of an ineligible noncitizen on a 
        Federal voter registration list leads to--
                    (A) confusion on the part of the ineligible person 
                with respect to their ineligibility to cast a ballot; 
                and
                    (B) an increased likelihood that human error will 
                permit ineligible persons to cast ballots in Federal 
                elections.
            (9) State officials have confirmed that poorly maintained 
        voter registration lists lead to ineligible persons casting 
        ballots in Federal elections.
            (10) A former Broward County, Florida, elections supervisor 
        has confirmed that ineligible nonvoters were able to cast 
        ballots in previous elections and that she was not able to 
        locate as many as 2,040 ballots during the 2018 midterm 
        recount.
            (11) This clarification of State authority to maintain 
        Federal voter registration lists to ensure noncitizens are not 
        included on such lists will promote voter confidence in 
        election processes and outcomes.
            (12) Congress has the authority to ensure that no Federal 
        elections funding is used to support States that permit 
        noncitizens to cast ballots in any election.
            (13) Federal courts and executive agencies have much of the 
        information States may need to maintain their Federal voter 
        registration lists, and those entities should make that 
        information accessible to State election authorities.
            (14) It is important to clarify the penalty for any 
        violation of law that allows a noncitizen to cast a ballot in a 
        Federal election.
            (15) To protect the confidence of voters in Federal 
        elections, it is important to implement the policy described 
        herein.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) allowing noncitizens to cast ballots in American 
        elections weakens our electoral system and the value of 
        citizenship and sows distrust in our elections system;
            (2) even if a State has the sovereign authority, no State 
        should permit noncitizens to cast ballots in State or local 
        elections;
            (3) States should use all information available to them to 
        maintain Federal voter registration lists and should inform 
        Congress if such data is insufficient; and
            (4) Congress may take further action in the future to 
        address this problem.

        State, ensure that the name of any registrant who is not a 
        citizen of the United States is maintained on a voter 
        registration list that is separate from the official list of 
        eligible voters with respect to registrants who are citizens of 
        the United States.''.
    (c) Requirements for Ballots for State or Local Jurisdictions That 
Allow Noncitizen Voting.--Section 301(a)(1) of the Help America Vote 
Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21081(a)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the

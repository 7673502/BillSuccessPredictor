 prescribed burn by the Forest Service in the Sante Fe National Forest 
                   in San Miguel County, New Mexico.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Hermit's Peak Fire Assistance Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) on April 6, 2022, the Forest Service initiated a 
        prescribed burn on Federal land in the Santa Fe National Forest 
        in San Miguel County, New Mexico, when erratic winds were 
        prevalent in the area that was also suffering from severe 
        drought after many years of insufficient precipitation;
            (2) on April 12, 2022, the prescribed burn, which became 
        known as the ``Hermit's Peak Fire'', exceeded the containment 
        capabilities of the Forest Service, was reclassified as a 
        wildland burn, and spread to other Federal and non-Federal 
        land, quickly becoming characterized as a wildfire;
            (3) on April 19, 2022, the Calf Canyon Fire, also in San 
        Miguel County, New Mexico, began burning on Federal land;
            (4) on April 27, 2022, the Hermit's Peak Fire and the Calf 
        Canyon Fire merged, and both fires were reported as the 
        Hermit's Peak Fire or the Hermit's Peak/Calf Canyon Fire, which 
        shall be referred to hereafter as the Hermit's Peak Fire;
            (5) by May 2, 2022, the fire had grown in size and caused 
        evacuations in multiple villages and communities in San Miguel 
        County and Mora County, including in the San Miguel county 
        jail, the State's psychiatric hospital, the United World 
        College, and New Mexico Highlands University;
            (6) on May 4, 2022, the President issued a major disaster 
        declaration for the counties of Colfax, Mora, and San Miguel, 
        New Mexico;
            (7) the fire resulted in the loss of Federal, State, local, 
        Tribal, and private property; and
            (8) the United States should compensate the victims of the 
        Hermit's Peak Fire.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to compensate victims of the fire at Hermit's Peak, New 
        Mexico, for injuries resulting from the fire; and
            (2) to provide for the expeditious consideration and 
        settlement of claims for those injuries.

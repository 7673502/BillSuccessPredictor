of law that refers (including through cross-reference to another 
provision of law) to the current recommendations of the United States 
Preventive Services Task Force with respect to breast cancer screening 
mammography shall be administered as if--
            (1) such reference to such current recommendations were a 
        reference to the recommendations of such Task Force with 
        respect to breast cancer screening mammography last issued 
        before 2009; and
            (2) such recommendations last issued before 2009 applied to

    (b) Continuing Medicare Coverage Without Coinsurance.--Section

Veterans Affairs.--Section 7322(b) of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:
    ``(b) The policy developed under subsection (a), and any other 
policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs relating to mammography 
screening, shall--
            ``(1) specify standards of mammography screening that 
        ensure that the frequency of such screenings is not less than 
        the frequency of such screenings provided pursuant to section 
        2(a) of the Protecting Access to Lifesaving Screenings Act of 
        2021;
            ``(2) provide recommendations, consistent with paragraph 
        (1), with respect to screening, and the frequency of screening, 
        for veterans, without regard to age, who have clinical 
        symptoms, risk factors, or family history of breast cancer; and

        cases.''.

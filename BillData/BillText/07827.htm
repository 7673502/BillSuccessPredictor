_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
    To impose a moratorium on large agribusiness, food and beverage 
               manufacturing, and grocery retail mergers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Food and Agribusiness Merger 
Moratorium and Antitrust Review Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Concentration in the food and agricultural economy, 
        including mergers, acquisitions, and other combinations and 
        alliances among suppliers, packers, integrators, other food 
        processors, distributors, and retailers has been accelerating 
        at a rapid pace since the 1980s, and particularly since the 
        2007 through 2009 recession.
            (2) The trend toward greater concentration in food and 
        agriculture has important and far reaching implications not 
        only for family farmers, but also for food chain workers, the 
        food we eat, the communities we live in, the integrity of the 
        natural environment upon which we all depend, and for our 
        collective public health.
            (3) The infant formula industry, for example, has reached 
        an alarming level of corporate concentration with 4 companies 
        now controlling nearly 90 percent of the infant formula market. 
        A disruption in the supply of just 1 infant formula producer 
        now presents a grave risk to infant health in the United 
        States.
            (4) In the past 4 decades, the top 4 largest pork packers 
        have seized control of 70 percent of the market, up from 36 
        percent. Over the same period, the top 4 beef packers have 
        expanded their market share from 32 percent to 85 percent. The 
        top 4 flour millers have increased their market share from 40 
        percent to 64 percent. The market share of the top 4 soybean 
        crushers has jumped from 54 percent to 79 percent, and the top 
        4 wet corn processors control of the market has increased from 
        63 percent to 86 percent.
            (5) Today the top 4 sheep, poultry, and fluid milk 
        processors now control 62 percent, 54 percent, and 50 percent 
        of the market, respectively.
            (6) The top 4 grain companies today control as much as 90 
        percent of the global grain trade.
            (7) During the past 5 years there has been a wave of 
        consolidation among global seed and crop-chemical firms, 3 
        companies now control nearly \2/3\ of the world's commodity 
        crop seeds. Those same 3 companies now also control nearly 70 
        percent of all agricultural chemicals and pesticides.
            (8) In the United States, the 4 largest corn seed sellers 
        accounted for 85 percent of the market in 2015, up from 60 
        percent in 2000. Over the past 20 years, the cost for an acre's 
        worth of seeds for an average corn farmer has nearly 
        quadrupled, and the cost of fertilizer has more than doubled. 
        Yet corn yields increased only 36 percent over that time, and 
        the price received for the sale of a bushel of corn increased 
        only 31 percent.
            (9) A handful of firms dominate the processing of every 
        major commodity. Many of them are vertically integrated, which 
        means that they control successive stages of the food chain, 
        from inputs to production to distribution. The growing number 
        and scale of cross-border agribusiness and food mergers have 
        put foreign firms, often with considerable government backing, 
        into prominent and even dominant positions in the United States 
        beef, hog, poultry, seed, fertilizer, and agrichemical sectors.
            (10) Growing concentration of the agricultural sector has 
        restricted choices for farmers trying to sell their products. 
        As the bargaining power of agribusiness firms over farmers 
        increases, concentrated agricultural commodity markets are 
        stacked against the farmer, with buyers of agricultural 
        commodities often possessing regional dominance in the form of 
        oligopsony or monopsony relative to sellers of such 
        commodities.
            (11) The high concentration and consolidation of buyers in 
        agricultural markets has resulted in the thinning of both cash 
        and future markets, thereby allowing dominant buyers to 
        leverage their market shares to move those markets to the 
        detriment of family farmers and ranchers.
            (12) Buyers with oligopsonistic or monopsonistic power have 
        incentives to engage in unfair and discriminatory acts that 
        cause farmers to receive less than a competitive price for 
        their goods. At the same time, some Federal courts have 
        incorrectly required a plaintiff to show harm to competition 
        generally, in addition to harm to the individual farmer, when 
        making a determination that an unfair, unjustly discriminatory, 
        deceptive, or preferential act exists under the Packers and 
        Stockyards Act of 1921.
            (13) The farmer's share of every retail dollar has 
        plummeted from 41 percent in 1950, to less than 15 percent 
        today, while the profit share for farm input, marketing, and 
        processing companies has risen.
            (14) While agribusiness conglomerates are posting record 
        earnings, farmers are facing desperate times. Since 2013, net 
        farm income for United States farmers has fallen by more than 
        half and median on farm income was negative in 2020.
            (15) The benefits of low commodity prices are not being 
        passed on to American consumers. The gap between what shoppers 
        pay for food and what farmers are paid is growing wider.
            (16) The steadily rising price of food has outpaced growth 
        in incomes for typical workers. Since the Great Recession, the 
        annual growth of real prices for food at the supermarket have 
        risen nearly 3 times faster than typical earnings.
            (17) There is a growing consensus that economic 
        consolidation contributes to the widening gap in economic 
        opportunity in the United States and bigger, more dominant 
        firms are more likely to deliver profits to investors than to 
        raise wages or benefits. Mega-mergers in the food and 
        agribusiness industries can lead to growing monopsony power 
        abuse resulting in wage suppression, along with massive layoffs 
        as companies shutter factories and facilities, harming working 
        families and communities.
            (18) Concentration, low prices, anticompetitive practices, 
        and other manipulations and abuses of the agricultural economy 
        are driving small family farmers out of business. Farmers are 
        going bankrupt or giving up, and few are taking their places; 
        more farm families are having to rely on other jobs to stay 
        afloat. Seventy-nine percent of farm household income came from 
        off farm work in 2020, up from 53 percent in 1960.
            (19) Eighty-one percent of America's farmed cropland is now 
        controlled by 15 percent of farms, and the number of farmers 
        leaving the land will continue to increase unless and until 
        these trends are reversed.
            (20) The decline of small family farms undermines the 
        economies of rural communities across America; it has pushed 
        Main Street businesses, from equipment suppliers to small 
        banks, out of business or to the brink of insolvency.
            (21) Increased concentration in the agribusiness sector has 
        a harmful effect on the environment; corporate hog farming, for 
        example, threatens the integrity of local water supplies and 
        creates noxious odors in neighboring communities. Concentration 
        also can increase the risks to food safety and limit the 
        biodiversity of plants and animals.
            (22) The decline of family farming poses a direct threat to 
        American families and family values, by subjecting farm 
        families to turmoil and stress. Farm advocates across the 
        country are reporting an increase in farmer suicides over the 
        past several years.
            (23) The decline of family farming causes the demise of 
        rural communities, as stores lose customers, churches lose 
        congregations, schools and clinics become under-used, career 
        opportunities for young people dry up, and local inequalities 
        of wealth and income grow wider.
            (24) These developments are not the result of inevitable 
        market forces. Its problems arise rather from policies made in 
        Washington, including farm, antitrust, and trade policies.
            (25) Past congressional action to remediate market failure, 
        such as enacting country-of-origin labeling to provide 
        transparency for domestic farmers, ranchers, and consumers 
        regarding agricultural commodity origins, have been overturned 
        for key commodities by oligopolistic conglomerates that use 
        undifferentiated imports to reduce domestic farm prices.
            (26) To restore competition in the agricultural economy, 
        and to increase the bargaining power and enhance economic 
        prospects for family farmers, the trend toward concentration 
        must be reversed.

SEC. 202. DUTIES OF THE COMMISSION.

    (a) In General.--The Commission shall be responsible for examining

agricultural economy in the broadest possible terms.
    (b) Issues To Be Addressed.--The study shall include an examination 
of the following matters:
            (1) The nature and extent of concentration in the food and 
        agricultural sector, including food production, manufacturing, 
        transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, retailing, 
        and farm inputs such as machinery, fertilizer, and seeds.
            (2) Current trends in concentration of the food and 
        agricultural sector and what this sector is likely to look like 
        in the near and longer term future.
            (3) The effects of rising concentration on suppliers, 
        workers and farmers, including independent and contract 
        farmers, with respect to--
                    (A) competition in markets for their products and 
                services;
                    (B) income and benefit levels;
                    (C) income distribution;
                    (D) income volatility;
                    (E) other material benefits; and
                    (F) wages and benefits of employees.
            (4) The impacts of this concentration upon rural 
        communities, rural economic development, and the natural 
        environment.
            (5) The impacts of concentration in the seed industry on 
        genetic diversity in farm fields and any related impacts on 
        food security.
            (6) The impacts of this concentration upon food shoppers, 
        including the reasons that low farm prices have not resulted in 
        corresponding drops in supermarket prices.
            (7) Whether farming is approaching a scale that is larger 
        than necessary from the standpoint of productivity.
            (8) The effect of current laws and administrative practices 
        in supporting and encouraging this concentration.
            (9) Whether the existing antitrust laws provide adequate 
        safeguards against, and remedies for, the impacts of 
        concentration upon family farms, the communities they comprise, 
        and the food shoppers of this Nation.
            (10) Accurate and reliable data on the national and 
        international markets shares of multinational agribusinesses, 
        and the portion of their sales attributable to exports.
            (11) Barriers that inhibit entry of new competitors into 
        markets for the processing of agricultural commodities, such as 
        the meat packing industry.
            (12) The extent to which developments, such as packer 
        ownership of livestock, formula pricing, marketing agreements, 
        production contracting, forward contracting, and vertical 
        integration tend to give processors, agribusinesses, 
        integrators, and other buyers of agricultural commodities 
        additional market power over farmers and suppliers in local 
        markets.
            (13) The extent to which mergers cause wage suppression, 
        layoffs, or reduced benefits to workers in the food and 
        agricultural sector.
            (14) Such related matters as the Commission determines to 
        be important.

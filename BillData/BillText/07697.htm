                                 A BILL


 
To support the development of limited equity cooperatives in the United 
                    States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Affordable CO-OP (Collective 
Opportunities for Owning Property) Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Limited equity cooperative housing stems from the 
        premise that housing should provide shelter, not a speculative 
        opportunity. Residents purchase a below market-rate ``equity'' 
        share of the cooperative corporation that owns the property of 
        the cooperative and residents are charged affordable monthly 
        carrying charges. The amount the share price increases over 
        time is limited by the cooperative by-laws, creating an 
        affordable entry point into housing that stays affordable over 
        time. Members can sell their equity share at a specific rate to 
        maintain affordability over a longer time period. In this way, 
        limited equity cooperatives provide an important form of 
        affordable homeownership and foster community among 
        shareholders.
            (2) Over 1.5 million families and seniors benefit from 
        cooperative housing models in the United States. There are over 
        200,000 units of limited equity housing units across the 
        Nation. Limited equity cooperatives range in size, from single 
        family detached cooperative structures to dense, mixed-use, 
        multi-family models.
            (3) The largest limited equity housing cooperative in North 
        America is Co-op City, located in the Bronx, New York. Co-op 
        City provides over 44,000 residents with affordable, 
        democratically controlled housing in an increasingly expensive 
        region. This community can serve as a model for the nation on 
        how to build and sustain decommodified housing and 
        homeownership opportunities for those who are 
        disproportionately exploited by the traditional housing market, 
        banking, and credit system, including Black and brown 
        households, low-income households, seniors, and people with 
        disabilities.
            (4) Limited equity cooperatives do not enjoy strong Federal 
        support relative to other forms of homeownership.

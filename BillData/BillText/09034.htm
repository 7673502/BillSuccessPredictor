SEC. 2. REFORM AND PERMANENT EXTENSION OF THE MEDICARE-DEPENDENT 
              HOSPITAL (MDH) PROGRAM.

    (a) Extension of Payment Methodology.--Section 1886(d)(5)(G) of the 
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(5)(G)) is amended--
            (1) in clause (i), by striking ``, and before October 1, 
        2022'' and inserting ``, and before October 1, 2023'';
            (2) in clause (i), by adding at the end the following; 
        ``For fiscal year 2024 and each subsequent fiscal year, in the 
        case of such a subsection (d) hospital, payment under paragraph 
        (1)(A) shall be equal to the sum of the amount determined under 
        paragraph (1)(A)(iii) and the amount determined by the increase 
        factor determined under clause (v) for such hospital and cost 
        reporting period.'';
            (3) in clause (ii)(II), by striking ``, and before October 
        1, 2022'' and inserting ``, and before October 1, 2023''; and
            (4) by adding at the end the following new clauses:
                    ``(v)(I) Subject to subclause (II), for purposes of 
                clause (i), for fiscal year 2024 and each subsequent 
                fiscal year with respect to a subsection (d) hospital 
                which is a medicare-dependent, small rural hospital, 
                the Secretary shall determine an increase factor to 
                apply to such hospital with respect to discharges 
                occurring during such fiscal year. When determining 
                such increase factor, the Secretary may take into 
                account a methodology that results in a similar amount 
                of reimbursement to such hospital for such fiscal year 
                as such amount that would have been determined if the 
                first sentence of clause (i) applied with respect to 
                such fiscal year.
                    ``(II) The aggregate amounts determined for all 
                subsection (d) hospitals which are medicare-dependent, 
                small rural hospitals by application of the increase 
                factors determined under this clause for such hospitals 
                shall not exceed a total of--
                            ``(aa) for fiscal year 2024, $100,000,000; 
                        and
                            ``(bb) for each subsequent fiscal year, the 
                        amount specified in this clause for the 
                        previous fiscal year increased by the market 
                        basket percentage increase (as defined in 
                        subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii)) as determined 
                        prospectively by the Secretary for such 
                        subsequent fiscal year.''.

                            (i) by striking ``through fiscal year 
                        2022'' and inserting ``through fiscal year 
                        2023''; and

                        inserting ``, and''; and
                    (D) by adding at the end the following new clause:

            ``(3) No effect on claims regarding lease or rental of real 
        property.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
                any claim in a civil action under State law asserted 
                after the date of enactment of this paragraph against a 
                provider of an interactive computer service if--

                        provider facilitated the lease or rental of 
                        real property in a circumstance in which a law 
                        or contractual agreement restricts the lease or 
                        rental;
                            ``(ii) the claimant, or an authorized agent 
                        of the claimant, provided written notice to the 
                        provider, or a designated agent of the 
                        provider, that the lease or rental of the real 
                        property described in clause (i) would violate 
                        a law or contractual agreement; and
                            ``(iii) the provider facilitated the lease 
                        or rental of the real property described in 
                        clause (i) after receiving the notice under 
                        clause (ii).

                (A)(ii), written notice provided by a claimant, or an 
                authorized agent thereof, to a provider of an 
                interactive computer service, or a designated agent

                        facilitating the lease or rental in a 
                        circumstance in which a law or contractual 
                        agreement restricts the lease or rental.

                        contractual agreement that restricts the lease 
                        or rental of real property facilitated by the 
                        provider.

                        perjury--
                                    ``(I) that the information in the 
                                notice is accurate; and
                                    ``(II) if the notice is provided by

        requirements and protection of property rights.--Nothing in 
        this section (other than subsection (c)(2)(A)) shall be 
        construed to prevent any State or unit of local government from 
        enforcing a law that restricts any provider of an interactive 
        computer service from booking a transaction for the lease or 
        rental of real property or providing ancillary services for 
        such a transaction.''.

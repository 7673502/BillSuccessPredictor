To abolish the Department of Education and to provide funding directly 
    to States for elementary and secondary education, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. ABOLISHMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

    (a) In General.--Effective on the date that is 30 days after the 
date of enactment of this Act--
            (1) the Department of Education is abolished; and
            (2) each applicable program is terminated.
    (b) Applicable Program Defined.--The term ``applicable program'' 
means each program for which the Secretary of Education or the 
Department of Education has administrative responsibility as provided 
by law or by delegation of authority pursuant to law as of the day 
before the date specified in subsection (a), except such term does not 
include--
            (1) the Federal Pell Grant program under section 401 of the 
        Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1070a); and
            (2) the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program under 
        part D of such Act (20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.).
    (c) Transfer of Functions.--Effective on the date specified in 
subsection (a), the authority to carry out the programs described in 
paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) is hereby transferred to the 
Secretary of the Treasury.

SEC. 2. BLOCK GRANTS TO STATES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) States should distribute non-Federal funds for 
        elementary and secondary education in a manner that promotes 
        competition and choices in education in order to secure the 
        best education available for each child; and
            (2) it is the fundamental right of parents to determine the 
        best education for their children.
    (b) Elementary and Secondary Education Grant Program.--The 
Secretary of the Treasury shall carry out a program under which the 
Secretary makes allocations to States, in accordance with subsection 
(c), to support elementary and secondary education.
    (c) Allocations to States.--The allocations made by the Secretary 
to each State under subsection (b) shall be in proportion to the 
aggregate amount of Federal individual income taxes paid by the 
residents of such State (relative to such aggregate amount paid by 
residents of all the States) as determined by the Secretary after 
consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.
    (d) Use of Funds.--A State that receives an allocation under 
subsection (c) shall use such funds to support elementary and secondary 
education in the State.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

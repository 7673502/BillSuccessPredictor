    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protection of Civilians in Military 
Operations Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress--
            (1) to commend the Department of Defense for its renewed 
        commitment to preventing and addressing harm to civilians 
        resulting from United States military operations and work to 
        develop an action plan to implement meaningful changes to 
        further prevent and address such harm;
            (2) to agree with the Department that harms to civilians is 
        a tragic and unavoidable part of war, and to recognize that--
                    (A) the Department endeavors to conduct all 
                military operations in compliance with the 
                international law of armed conflict and the laws of the 
                United States, including distinction, proportionality, 
                and the requirement to take feasible precautions in 
                planning and conducting operations to reduce the risk 
                of harm to civilians and other protected persons and 
                objects;
                    (B) the protection of civilians and other protected 
                persons and objects, in addition to a legal obligation 
                and a strategic interest, is a moral and ethical 
                imperative;
                    (C) despite those commitments, military operations 
                of the United States and partner countries during the 
                two decades before the date of the enactment of this 
                Act have resulted in civilian deaths and injuries, and 
                damage to or destruction of civilian objects including 
                critical infrastructure, in at least Afghanistan, Iraq, 
                Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen; and
                    (D) more must be done to improve the protection of 
                civilians;
            (3) that the Department has submitted to Congress four 
        successive annual reports on civilian casualties resulting from 
        United States military operations for calendar years 2017, 
        2018, 2019, and 2020, and has updated reports as appropriate; 
        and
            (4) to recognize the efforts of the Department, both in 
        policy and in practice, to reduce the harm to civilians and 
        other protected persons and objects resulting from United 
        States military operations, and to encourage the Department to 
        make additional progress in--
                    (A) developing at all combatant commands personnel 
                and offices responsible for advising the commanders of 
                such commands, and integrating into command strategy, 
                the promotion of observance of human rights and the 
                protection of civilians and other protected persons and 
                objects;
                    (B) finalizing and implementing the policy of the 
                Department relating to civilian casualties resulting 
                from United States military operations, as required by 
                section 936 of the John S. McCain National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-

                Defense Authorization for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 
                116-92; 10 U.S.C. 2731 note), for ex gratia payments 
                for damage, personal injury, or death that is incident

        Secretary of Defense determines that an interview described in

        Secretary shall--

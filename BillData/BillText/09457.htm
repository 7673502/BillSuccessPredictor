                                 A BILL


 
To require an interagency study on the environmental and energy impacts 
 of crypto-asset mining, to assess crypto-asset mining compliance with 
               the Clean Air Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Crypto-Asset Environmental 
Transparency Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) human activity is the dominant cause of observed 
        climate change in the past century;
            (2) climate change is increasing the frequency and 
        intensity of wildfires, droughts, severe storms, heat waves, 
        rising of sea levels, and severe weather events;
            (3) the Federal Government has--
                    (A) committed under the decision of the 21st 
                Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework 
                Convention on Climate Change, adopted in Paris, France, 
                December 12, 2015 (commonly referred to as the ``Paris 
                Agreement''), to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 
                to 52 percent by 2030; and
                    (B) a responsibility to mitigate current and future 
                impacts of climate change to protect the health, 
                safety, and welfare of individuals of the United 
                States;
            (4) crypto-asset mining operations--
                    (A) can be energy intensive; and
                    (B) unlike most other technologies, are often 
                designed to generally increase computing requirements 
                over time, which can lead to increased energy 
                consumption;
            (5) a crypto-asset network, Bitcoin, consumes more energy 
        annually than countries such as Chile or Bangladesh consume;
            (6) crypto-asset mining operations often rely on fossil 
        fuels for power, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions;
            (7) the carbon dioxide emissions of the United States from 
        Bitcoin mining were estimated at 21 to 35 megatons per year in 
        2022, which is equivalent to the annual emissions from more 
        than 4,500,000 to 7,500,000 gasoline-powered cars driven for 1 
        year;
            (8) crypto-asset mining can also cause local noise and 
        water pollution;
            (9) the number of crypto-asset mining facilities in the 
        United States is increasing, and the share of the United States 
        of global Bitcoin mining rose from 3.5 percent in 2020 to 38 
        percent in 2022;
            (10) crypto-asset mining is an emergent industry, and the 
        potential of crypto-asset mining to exacerbate systemic racial, 
        social, environmental, and economic injustices is not 
        sufficiently understood;
            (11) there is no comprehensive, independent study of 
        crypto-asset mining operations in the United States, including 
        the energy use, resource mix, and greenhouse gas emissions of 
        those crypto-asset mining operations; and
            (12) one of the primary recommendations of the report of 
        the Office of Science and Technology Policy entitled ``Climate 
        and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States'' 
        and dated September 2022 was to obtain detailed data on energy 
        use and emissions from crypto-asset activity.

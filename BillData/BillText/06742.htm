SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interests of the United 
        States--
                    (A) to continue and deepen the security partnership 
                between the United States and Ukraine; and
                    (B) to support Ukraine's sovereignty and 
                territorial integrity;
            (2) aggression and malign influence by the Government of 
        the Russian Federation and its proxies in Ukraine are a threat 
        to the democratic sovereignty of Ukraine and the lives and 
        livelihoods of its people;
            (3) the increase in Russian Federation troops, armor, 
        artillery, and associated military equipment on Ukraine's 
        border that began in March 2021 and escalated significantly in 
        October 2021--
                    (A) threatens the safety, security, financial 
                stability, and sovereignty of Ukraine;
                    (B) is destabilizing to the security of the entire 
                European continent; and
                    (C) may presage an invasion of Ukraine by the 
                Russian Federation, an event that would be Russia's 
                second invasion of Ukraine since 2014;
            (4) the United States, in coordination with the European 
        Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
        Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and 
        members of the international community, should--
                    (A) support the territorial integrity of Ukraine; 
                and
                    (B) take action to oppose any effort by the 
                Government of the Russian Federation to further 
                encroach on Ukraine's territory and independence;
            (5) any concession made by the United States and NATO to 
        the demands of the Government of the Russian Federation 
        regarding NATO membership or expansion is antithetical to the 
        North Atlantic Treaty and the commitments at the core of the 
        liberal democratic order;
            (6) economic and financial sanctions, when used as part of 
        a coordinated and comprehensive strategy, are a powerful tool 
        to advance United States foreign policy and national security 
        interests; and
            (7) the United States, in coordination with allies and 
        partners of the United States, should impose substantial new 
        sanctions and export controls in response to each act of 
        aggression by the Government of the Russian Federation or its 
        proxies, and to their full extent in the event of escalatory 
        military operations or other destabilizing aggression against 
        Ukraine.

SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to support the territorial integrity of Ukraine and 
        other countries against aggression by the Government of the 
        Russian Federation or its proxies;
            (2) to ensure the swift and ongoing provision to Ukraine of 
        lethal and nonlethal security assistance, including surface-to-

        defense articles, and the lending or leasing of military 
        equipment;
            (3) to build the resilience of Ukraine's military defenses 
        and bolster Ukraine's ability to defend against aggression by 
        the Government of the Russian Federation making available 
        assistance to Ukraine's security forces under the Foreign 
        Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) or chapter 16 
        of title 10, United States Code, to improve interoperability 
        with NATO forces, and engage in critical areas, including air, 
        sea, and cyber defense;
            (4) to declassify or downgrade United States intelligence 
        on Russian malign activities in Ukraine, Belarus, and the

        maximum extent possible, and to enable and encourage

        cybersecurity policy, to enhance technical infrastructure, to 
        support cybersecurity education and training, and to promote 
        Ukraine's engagement with international cybersecurity 
        frameworks and organizations;
            (6) to counter Russian propaganda and disinformation about 
        Ukraine and support unrestricted, independent news and 
        reporting for audiences on the periphery of the Russian 
        Federation, including by increasing support for Radio Free 
        Europe/Radio Liberty;
            (7) to further enhance security cooperation and engagement 
        with regional partners, including those in the Black Sea region 
        and the Baltic States, in an effort to strengthen Ukrainian and 
        regional security;
            (8) to work closely with NATO allies, particularly allies 
        that share a border with the Russian Federation, on any matters 
        related to European security;
            (9) to reduce the dependence of allies and partners of the 
        United States on energy resources that originate in the Russian 
        Federation in order for such countries to achieve lasting and 
        dependable energy security, including by increasing access to 
        diverse, reliable, and affordable energy;
            (10) to condemn the Government of the Russian Federation 
        for, and to deter such government from, using its energy 
        resources as a geopolitical weapon to coerce, intimidate, and 
        influence other countries;
            (11) to formulate a rapid and comprehensive response to any 
        humanitarian crisis inflicted upon the people of Ukraine as a 
        result of Russian aggression, including mechanisms for 
        emergency response, observation and monitoring of abuses, and 
        justice and accountability, including through the Organization 
        for Security and Co-operation in Europe;
            (12) to remain committed to a strong and unified NATO and

        that shares our values and meets the necessary responsibilities 
        and obligations;
            (14) to continue to fully support NATO's decision in the 
        2008 Bucharest Summit Declaration, reaffirmed ever since 
        including in the June 2021 Brussels Summit, that Ukraine and 
        Georgia will become NATO members;
            (15) to repudiate Russia's proposal for a ``deployment 
        moratorium'' in the European theater for intermediate-range

        Russia repeatedly violated the agreement causing its demise; 
        and
            (16) to continue the current United States nuclear 
        declaratory policy of ``calculated ambiguity'' and reject 
        changes to United States nuclear declaratory policy that would 
        invite further Russian aggression and undermine NATO unity, 
        such as ``Sole Purpose'', ``Fundamental Purpose'', or ``No 
        First Use''.

   TITLE I--EXPEDITING SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO UKRAINE AND BOLSTERING

of a notification under section 516(f)(1), the President certifies to 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and 
the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate that an emergency 
exists that necessitates the immediate transfer of the article. If the 
President states in his notice that an emergency exists which requires 
the proposed transfer is in the national security interest of the 
United States, thus waiving the congressional review requirements of

            (2) in light of the military build-up by the Government of 
        the Russian Federation, the United States, working with allies 
        and partners, should work to expedite the provision of defense 
        articles and other security assistance to Ukraine and 
        prioritize and facilitate assistance to respond to the most 
        urgent defense needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine; and

        under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 
        2776(b)) is in the security and foreign policy interests of the 
        United States; and

SEC. 111. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT OF EMERGENCY ARMS 
              TRANSFERS AND SALES TO UKRAINE AND CENTRAL AND EASTERN 
              EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that:
            (1) Ukraine and its neighboring Central and Eastern 
        European (CEE) countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, 
        Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, 
        Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) in NATO are at a heightened 
        threat of Russian military aggression. As security partners and 
        NATO allies, the United States provides defense articles, 
        services, design and construction services, and major defense 
        equipment under the Arms Export Control Act and in accordance 
        with the Foreign Assistance Act.
            (2) There is an urgent need to provide for these defense 
        articles and services as a result of the emergency security 
        situation created by Russia's destabilizing military presence 
        in and around Ukraine. This military buildup poses a threat of 
        a potential military invasion, and hybrid attack, including 
        cyberattacks, political subversion and paramilitary activity. A 
        military invasion, which may include non-conventional warfare, 
        would potentially result in instability in Ukraine and the 
        neighboring CEE countries.
    (b) Application and Administration of Contingency Provision of Law 
With Respect to Ukraine and CEE Countries.--During the 6-month period 
beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act--
            (1) notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 
        President is authorized to use available funds to carry out any 
        provision of this Act in order to provide for any defense 
        articles, services, design and construction services, and major 
        defense equipment under the Arms Export Control Act to Ukraine 
        and CEE countries; and
            (2) the President shall waive appropriate charges, 
        including for administrative services, a proportionate amount 
        of any nonrecurring costs, and the recovery of ordinary 
        inventory losses associated with the sale from stocks, or 
        replacement if the articles are damaged while leased.
    (c) Report.--The President shall report within 10 days promptly to 
the Speaker and minority leader of the House of Representatives and to 
the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, and Appropriations 
of the House of Representatives and the Committees on Foreign 
Relations, Armed Services, and Appropriations of the Senate each time 
the authority contained in this subsection is exercised. A 
certification shall accompany this report explaining how the immediate 
issuance of these licenses, transfers, sales, leases, and third-party 
transfers contributed directly to the emergency use of the 
notwithstanding provision in this section, including the status of 
shipments--
            (1) when the defense articles subject to the certification 
        were shipped;
            (2) the serial number of any Major Defense Equipment as 
        defined in section 47(6) of the AECA shipped;
            (3) the schedules for projected periods of performance of 
        defense services provided;
            (4) a list of any outstanding Major Defense Equipment (MDE) 
        subject to shipment under the emergency certification, and 
        their scheduled deliveries;
            (5) the estimated value of these defense articles; and
            (6) the estimated cost and length of time for training on 
        transferred defense articles.
    (d) Provisions of Law Described.--The provisions of law described 
in this subsection are--
            (1) subsections (a)(4) and (d)(2) of section 3 of the Arms 
        Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2753);
            (2) subsections (e)(2)(A), (h)(1)(A), and (h)(2) of section 
        21 and section 22 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2761);
            (3) subsection (b)(1) and subsections (b)(2), (b)(6), 
        (c)(2)(A), (c)(5), and (d)(2)(A) of section 36 of such Act (22 
        U.S.C. 2776);
            (4) section 51 of such Act;
            (5) section 62(c)(1) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796a(c)(1));
            (6) section 63(a)(2) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 2796b(a)(2)); 
        and
            (7) section 516(c)(2) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
        (22 U.S.C. 2321j(c)(2)).
    (e) Continued Application.--The President is authorized to continue 
to apply this emergency provision in the provisions of law described in 
subsection (d) for purposes of applying and administering such 
provisions of law for one additional 6-month period, beginning after 
the end of the 6-month period described in subsection (b) if, with 
respect to an additional 6-month period, the Secretary--
            (1) determines that such continued application is in the 
        national security interest of the United States;
            (2) determines that such continued application complements 
        decisions by the NATO Advisory Council; and
            (3) submits such determination to the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations of the Senate not later than 5 days before 
        the start of such an additional 6-month period.
    (f) Termination.--This section shall terminate one year after the 
date of enactment of this Act.

        companies that have already completed their DCC contractor 
        certification.
            (4) The President should immediately direct the Department 
        of State, Department of Commerce, and the Department of Defense 
        to issue temporary guidelines for the expedited processing, 
        review, and issuance of commercial contracts for direct 
        purchase of United States defense articles and services from 
        United States firms to be financed with funds under this 
        section.

SEC. 113. INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING COOPERATION 
              WITH UKRAINE.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) International Military Education and Training (IMET) is

        countries;
            (2) it is in the national interest of the United States to

SEC. 211. STRATEGY FOR COOPERATION ON INTERMEDIATE-RANGE MISSILE 
              LAUNCHERS AND SYSTEMS TO NATO ALLIES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) All NATO allies agree that the SSC-8/9M729 missile 
        system developed and deployed by the Government of Russia 
        violated the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (in this 
        section referred to as the ``INF Treaty''), while posing a 
        significant risk to NATO security.
            (2) Despite NATO allies' repeated calls on the Government 
        of Russia to return to full and verifiable compliance with the 
        INF Treaty, Russia continued to develop and deploy INF Treaty-
        violating systems, which led to the INF Treaty's demise on 
        August 2, 2019.
            (3) As of the INF Treaty's demise, Russia had produced and 
        deployed multiple battalions of INF Treaty-violating missiles, 
        capable of reaching key European capitals and targets.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--A mutual deployment moratorium in the 
European theater with the Russian Federation is not in the interest of 
the United States. Even if a European-Theater intermediate-range 
ground-launched missile deployment moratorium were verifiable, any such 
moratorium would significantly advantage Russia and disadvantage NATO. 
This is due to the Russian Federation's continual threats of aggression 
against sovereign European nations, the relative ease by which Russia 
could deploy such systems to the theater, and the logistical 
impediments with which the United States and NATO would have to contend 
should it be determined a commensurate response was warranted.
    (c) Strategy.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
State shall jointly develop and submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a strategy to cooperate with willing NATO member countries in 
the joint research, development, training and possible transfer of 
conventional intermediate-range ground-launched missiles, associated 
launchers and support equipment, and associated technology.
    (d) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on 
        Armed Services of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 212. PROHIBITION ON RUSSIAN ACCESS TO MISSILE DEFENSE SITES.

    (a) Restriction.--The Secretary of Defense shall not allow access 
to a foreign national of Russia to a covered site.
    (b) Construction With Other Requirements.--Nothing in this section 
shall be construed to supersede or otherwise affect section 130h of 
title 10, United States Code.
    (c) Covered Site.--In this section, the term ``covered site'' means 
any of the following:
            (1) The combat information center of a naval ship equipped 
        with the Aegis ballistic missile defense system.
            (2) An Aegis Ashore site.
            (3) A terminal high altitude area defense battery.
            (4) A ground-based midcourse defense interceptor silo.

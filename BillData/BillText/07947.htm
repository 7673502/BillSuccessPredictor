low-income persons ready to receive weatherization measures pursuant to 
the weatherization program conducted under this part by addressing 
structural, plumbing, roofing, and electrical issues and environmental 
hazards, and implementing other measures that the Secretary determines 
to be appropriate, to reduce the frequency of deferrals of such 
weatherization measures when the condition of a dwelling unit renders 
delivery of weatherization measures unsafe or ineffective.
    ``(b) Alignment of Requirements.--Except as otherwise provided in 
this section, to the extent possible, the Secretary shall, in 
establishing the weatherization readiness program under this section--
            ``(1) align the requirements of such weatherization 
        readiness program with the requirements of the weatherization 
        program conducted under this part; and
            ``(2) seek to reduce barriers to leveraging other sources 
        of funding for weatherization readiness measures.
    ``(c) Savings-to-Investment Ratio.--The weatherization readiness 
program established under this section shall not include a savings-to-
investment ratio requirement.
    ``(d) Previous Weatherization.--Weatherization readiness measures 
implemented pursuant to the weatherization readiness program 
established under this section shall not be considered previous 
weatherization for purposes of section 415(c)(2).
    ``(e) Average Cost Per Dwelling Unit.--The Secretary may establish, 
or require a State grantee to establish, a limit for expenditures for 
weatherization readiness measures, including labor, materials, and 
related matters, to be implemented with respect to a dwelling unit, on 
an average cost per unit basis, pursuant to the weatherization 
readiness program established under this section.
    ``(f) Allocation of Funds.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall allocate funding 
        made available under this section to States and tribal 
        organizations in a manner consistent with the allocation of 
        financial assistance for weatherization assistance under the 
        weatherization program conducted under this part.
            ``(2) Updated allocation.--Not sooner than October 1, 2026, 
        the Secretary, in consultation with States and tribal 
        organizations, may, by rule, update the method to allocate 
        funding to States and tribal organizations under this section 
        to more accurately reflect the relative need for funding for 
        weatherization readiness measures among low-income persons 
        throughout the States and Indian tribes.
    ``(g) Administrative Expenses.--Not more than an amount equal to 15 
percent of any grant made by the Secretary under this section may be 
used for administrative purposes, except that not more than one-half of 
such amount may be used by any State for such purposes.
    ``(h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated $90,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027 to 
carry out this section.''.
            (2) Table of contents amendment.--The table of contents for

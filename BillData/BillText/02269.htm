 To modify the presumption of service connection for veterans who were 
   exposed to herbicide agents while serving in the Armed Forces in 
        Thailand during the Vietnam era, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

              VIETNAM ERA.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall ensure 
that if the Secretary creates a presumption of service connection 
between the occurrence of a disease and exposure to a herbicide agent 
while serving in the Armed Forces during the covered period at a 
military base in Thailand, such presumption also applies to exposure to 
a herbicide agent while serving in the Armed Forces during the covered 
period at any military base located in Thailand without regard to where 
on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the 
veteran performed.
    (b) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Covered period.--The term ``covered period'' means the 
        period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 
        1976.
            (2) Herbicide agent.--The term ``herbicide agent'' has the 
        meaning given such term in section 1116(a) of title 38, United 
        States Code.
            (3) Veteran.--The term ``veteran'' has the meaning given 
        such term in section 101 of title 38, United States Code.

microphone as a component of the covered device.

SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION.

    (a) Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices.--A violation of section 
2 shall be treated as a violation of a rule defining an unfair or 
deceptive act or practice prescribed under section 18(a)(1)(B) of the 
Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 57a(a)(1)(B)).
    (b) Actions by the Commission.--
            (1) In general.--The Federal Trade Commission shall prevent 
        any person from violating this Act or a regulation promulgated 
        under this Act in the same manner, by the same means, and with 
        the same jurisdiction, powers, and duties as though all 
        applicable terms and provisions of the Federal Trade Commission 
        Act (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.) were incorporated into and made a 
        part of this Act.
            (2) Penalties and privileges.--Any person who violates this 
        Act or a regulation promulgated under this Act shall be subject

        seq.).
    (c) Commission Guidance.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Commission, through outreach to relevant 
private entities, shall issue guidance to assist manufacturers in 
complying with the requirements of this Act, including guidance about 
best practices for making the disclosure required by section 2 as clear 
and conspicuous as practicable.
    (d) Tailored Guidance.--A manufacturer of a covered device may 
petition the Commission for tailored guidance as to how to meet the 
requirements of section 2.
    (e) Limitation on Commission Guidance.--No guidance issued by the 
Commission with respect to this Act shall confer any rights on any 
person, State, or locality, nor shall operate to bind the Commission or 
any person to the approach recommended in such guidance. In any 
enforcement action brought pursuant to this Act, the Commission shall 
allege a specific violation of a provision of this Act. The Commission 
may not base an enforcement action on, or execute a consent order based 
on, practices that are alleged to be inconsistent with any such 
guidelines, unless the Commission determines such practices expressly 
violate section 2.

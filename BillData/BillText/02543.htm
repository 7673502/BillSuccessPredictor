    The Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 221 et seq.) is amended by 
inserting after section 2B the following:

    ``The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the 
Federal Open Market Committee shall exercise all duties and functions 
in a manner that fosters the elimination of disparities across racial

                following:

                future described in the report required in subsection 
                (b), including a discussion of disparities in 
                employment, income, and wealth across racial and ethnic 
                groups as well as other specific segments of the 
                population; and
                    ``(C) plans, activities, and actions of the Board 
                and the Federal Open Market Committee to minimize and

                with respect to employment, wages, wealth, and access 
                to affordable credit pursuant to section 2C.''; and
            (2) in subsection (b)--
                    (A) by striking ``The Board'' and inserting the 
                following:
            ``(1) In general.--The Board''; and
                    (B) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(2) Trend information.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Each report required under 
                paragraph (1) shall include recent trends in the 
                unemployment rate, labor force participation rate,

                        educational attainment, age, disability (as 
                        such term is defined in section 3 of the 
                        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990), and

                    ``(C) Ethnic subgroup defined.--The term `ethnic 
                subgroup' means a social group that--
                            ``(i) has a distinct social, racial, 
                        geographic, national origin, or cultural 
                        identity; and
                            ``(ii) is susceptible to being 
                        disadvantaged.''.
    (b) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, in 
consultation with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office 
of the Comptroller of the Currency, the National Credit Union 
Administration, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, shall 
issue a report to Congress containing the plans, activities, and 
actions of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to

           TITLE II--DIVERSITY DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING

      Subtitle A--Diversity and Inclusion Data Accountability and 
                              Transparency

SEC. 211. DISCLOSURES BY REGULATED ENTITIES.

    Section 342(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 
Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 5452(b)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
            ``(5) Disclosures by regulated entities.--The Director of 
        each Office shall require entities with 100 employees or 
        greater regulated by the applicable agency to provide such 
        information as may be required to carry out the duties of the 
        Director.''.

   Subtitle B--LGBTQ Business Equal Credit Enforcement and Investment

SEC. 221. SMALL BUSINESS LOAN DATA COLLECTION.

    (a) In General.--Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1691c-2) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``LGBTQ-owned,'' after ``minority-owned,'' 
        each place such term appears;
            (2) in subsection (e)(2)(G), by inserting ``, sexual 
        orientation, gender identity'' after ``sex''; and
            (3) in subsection (h), by adding at the end the following:
            ``(7) LGBTQ-owned business.--The term `LGBTQ-owned 
        business' means a business--
                    ``(A) more than 50 percent of the ownership or 
                control of which is held by 1 or more individuals self-
                identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
                queer; and
                    ``(B) more than 50 percent of the net profit or 
                loss of which accrues to 1 or more individuals self-
                identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or 
                queer.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that the 
term ``sex'', as used within the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, includes 
an individual's sexual orientation and gender identity, and that this 
section, in part, clarifies that the sex, sexual orientation, and 
gender identity of the principal owners of a business should be 
collected under section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as 
three separate forms of information.

                TITLE III--ACCESS TO HOUSING AND LENDING

      Subtitle A--Improving Language Access in Mortgage Servicing

SEC. 311. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Housing is the largest portion of most household 
        budgets in the United States and therefore a foundational 
        component of financial access and opportunity.
            (2) Due in part to a legacy of discrimination in the United 
        States, people of color are disproportionately experiencing 
        homelessness, are disproportionately renting, and 
        disproportionately paying unaffordable rents, which acts as a 
        barrier to homeownership.
            (3) Access to fair and affordable housing, both rental and 
        homeownership opportunities, is critical to upward economic 
        mobility. This includes addressing language barriers in 
        mortgage servicing to ensure borrowers have culturally 
        sensitive, in-language access to critical lending information, 
        can enter into fair and sustainable homeownership, and preserve 
        their home equity.

SEC. 312. LANGUAGE ACCESS REQUIREMENTS AND RESOURCES.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 2 of title I of the Truth in Lending Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1631 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 129H the 
following:
``Sec. 129I. Language access requirements.
    ``(a) Standard Language Preference Form.--Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this section, the Director of the 
Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection shall, after consulting with 
the Secretary of Agriculture, the Director of the Federal Housing

of the Federal Housing Authority, issue a rule establishing a standard 
language preference form that includes a standard language preference 
question asked in each of the 8 languages most commonly spoken by 
individuals with limited English proficiency, as determined by the 
Director of the Bureau using information published by the Director of 
the Bureau of the Census.
    ``(b) Requirements for Creditors.--
            ``(1) Use of standard language preference form by 
        creditors.--
                    ``(A) Inclusion in application.--Each creditor

                        preference form; and
                            ``(ii) the English version of any document 
                        to which such form applies is the official and 
                        operative document and the translated version 
                        is for informational purposes only.
                    ``(C) Documentation and transfer of preferred 
                language information.--If a creditor receives 
                information about a language preference of a consumer 
                through the standard language preference form from 
                another creditor or a servicer or a borrower, such 
                creditor shall document this language preference in 
                each file and electronic file of information associated 
                with such consumer and shall transfer such information 
                and the standard language preference form to any

        paragraph (1)(C), such creditor shall--
                    ``(A) provide such translated document in addition

          Subtitle D--Ensuring Diversity in Community Banking

SEC. 441. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Ensuring Diversity in Community 
Banking Act''.

SEC. 442. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON FUNDING THE LOAN-LOSS RESERVE FUND FOR 
              SMALL DOLLAR LOANS.

    The sense of Congress is the following:
            (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund 
        (the ``CDFI Fund'') is an agency of the Department of the 
        Treasury, and was established by the Riegle Community 
        Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The mission 
        of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity for 
        underserved people and communities by supporting the growth and 
        capacity of a national network of community development 
        lenders, investors, and financial service providers''. A 
        community development financial institution (a ``CDFI'') is a 
        specialized financial institution serving low-income 
        communities and a Community Development Entity (a ``CDE'') is a 
        domestic corporation or partnership that is an intermediary 
        vehicle for the provision of loans, investments, or financial 
        counseling in low-income communities. The CDFI Fund certifies 
        CDFIs and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or CDE allows 
        organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund programs as 
        follows:
                    (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which 
                provides FDIC-insured depository institutions awards 
                for a demonstrated increase in lending and investments 
                in distressed communities and CDFIs.
                    (B) The CDFI Program, which provides Financial and 
                Technical Assistance awards to CDFIs to reinvest in the 
                CDFI, and to build the capacity of the CDFI, including 
                financing product development and loan loss reserves.
                    (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, 
                which provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial 
                and Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and 
                grow the number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to 
                help build capacity of such CDFIs.
                    (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which 
                provides tax credits for making equity investments in 
                CDEs that stimulate capital investments in low-income 
                communities.
                    (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards 
                to CDFIs and nonprofit affordable housing organizations 
                to finance affordable housing solutions and related 
                economic development activities.
                    (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-
                term, patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and 
                investment capacity for community and economic 
                development purposes.
            (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create 
        multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-moderate 
        income individuals to establish accounts at federally insured 
        banks, and to improve low-to-moderate income individuals' 
        access to such accounts on reasonable terms.
            (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI 
        Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to 
        establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related 
        losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients 
        with the financial counseling and education necessary to 
        conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans 
        provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other 
        nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive 
        interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of 
        Americans to fall into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can only 
        be made pursuant to terms, conditions, and practices that are 
        reasonable for the individual consumer obtaining the loan.
            (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible 
        institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in 
        section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt from 
        tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured depository 
        institutions, community development financial institutions and 
        State, local, or Tribal government entities.
            (5) According to the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as 
        much as $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the 
        CDFI Fund. The Administration and the Congress should 
        prioritize appropriation of funds for the loan loss reserve 
        fund and technical assistance programs administered by the 
        Community Development Financial Institution Fund.

      TITLE VI--ENSURING DIVERSE LEADERSHIP OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE

SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Ensuring Diverse Leadership Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 602. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) while significant progress has occurred due to the 
        antidiscrimination amendments to the Federal Reserve Act, 
        barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for candidates 
        reflective of gender diversity and racial or ethnic diversity 
        for Federal Reserve bank president positions in the Federal 
        Reserve System;
            (2) the continuing barriers described in paragraph (1) 
        merit the following amendment;
            (3) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of the historical lack of gender, racial, and 
        ethnic diversity from numerous sources, including congressional 
        hearings, scientific reports, reports issued by public and 
        private agencies, news stories, and reports of related barriers 
        by organizations and individuals, which show that 
        race-, ethnicity-, and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
        insufficient to address the problem;
            (4) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph 
        (3) demonstrate that barriers across the United States prove 
        problematic for full and fair participation in developing 
        monetary policy by individuals reflective of gender diversity 
        and racial or ethnic diversity; and
            (5) the testimony and documentation described in paragraph 
        (3) provide a strong basis that there is a compelling need for 
        the below amendment to address the historical lack of gender, 
        racial, and ethnic diversity in the Federal Reserve regional 
        bank presidents selection process in the Federal Reserve 
        System.

reserve bank shall submit to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and

 TITLE X--EXPANDING ACCESS TO CREDIT THROUGH CONSUMER-PERMISSIONED DATA

SEC. 1001. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Expanding Access to Credit through 
Consumer-Permissioned Data Act''.

SEC. 1002. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Using alternative data in mortgage lending (either 
        through alternative credit scores or in underwriting) has the 
        potential to increase access to credit for individuals with 
        little or no credit history with the national credit reporting 
        agencies (NCRAs), according to a review of alternative data use 
        in mortgage lending by the Government Accountability Office in 
        December 2021.
            (2) Approximately 45 million consumers do not have any 
        credit history with the NCRAs or did not have enough credit 
        history to be scored, according to a 2015 report by the Bureau 
        of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB), entitled ``Data Point: 
        Credit Invisibles''. The CFPB also reported that this 
        population disproportionately included low-income consumers, 
        younger consumers, and consumers of color.
            (3) The use of alternative data to establish a low- or 
        moderate-income borrower's credit history for the purpose of 
        extending mortgage credit can help lenders meet goals of the 
        Community Reinvestment Act.
            (4) Mortgage underwriting systems that allow lenders to use 
        consumer-permissioned alternative credit information may help 
        expand access to mortgages for borrowers with lower credit 
        scores and communities of color. On September 21, 2021, Fannie 
        Mae updated its automated underwriting system so that it 
        notifies lenders that a borrower may benefit from the inclusion 
        of consistent rental payment information, and with the 
        consumer's permission, the underwriting system will 
        automatically identify rental payments within bank statement 
        data and include this in its credit assessment. According to a 
        fair lending and credit risk analysis by Fannie Mae and the 
        Federal Housing Finance Agency, the populations most likely to 
        benefit from this change are applicants with lower credit 
        scores, who are disproportionately consumers of color.

              MAKING MORTGAGE LOANS.

    (a) In General.--The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. 1691

                    ``(C) states that the applicant does not believe 
                that credit information reported through consumer

                applicant's creditworthiness in the absence of such 
                information; and
            ``(2) the credit information relates to the types of 
        information that the creditor would consider if otherwise

                of providing such information;
                    ``(B) the right of the creditor to disregard any

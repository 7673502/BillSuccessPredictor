SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON ABORTION.

    (a) Prohibition.--No Federal funds may be provided (directly or

funds are provided, the entity will not perform, and will not provide 
any funds to any other entity that performs, an abortion.

            (2) a physician certifies that the woman suffers from a 
        physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness that 
        would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is 
        performed, including a life-threatening physical condition 
        caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section, the term ``entity'' means the 
entire legal entity, including any entity that controls, is controlled 
by, or is under common control with such entity.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the manufacture, distribution, and importation of 
        firearms is inherently commercial in nature;
            (2) firearms regularly move in interstate commerce;
            (3) to the extent that firearms trafficking is intrastate 
        in nature, it arises out of and is substantially connected with 
        a commercial transaction that, when viewed in the aggregate, 
        substantially affects interstate commerce;
            (4) because the intrastate and interstate trafficking of 
        firearms are so commingled, full regulation of interstate 
        commerce requires the incidental regulation of intrastate 
        commerce;
            (5) firearm-related assaults in the United States during 
        the 19-year period between 2001 and 2019 were--
                    (A) associated with the majority of homicides and 
                half of all suicides; and
                    (B) the seventh leading cause of nonfatal violent 
                injuries;
            (6) on the afternoon of May 10, 2007, Blair Holt, a junior 
        at Julian High School in Chicago, was killed on a public bus 
        riding home from school when he used his body to shield a girl 
        who was in the line of fire after a young man boarded the bus 
        and started shooting;
            (7) since 2007, when 32 students and teachers were killed 
        at Virginia Tech, 7 of the 11 most deadly mass shootings in the 
        United States have taken place;
            (8) since 2012, when 20 first graders and teachers were 
        murdered with an assault rifle at Sandy Hook Elementary School 
        in Newtown, Connecticut, more than 230 school shootings have 
        occurred in the United States;
            (9) in 2015, there were 335 mass shootings, including, 
        notably, the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, 
        the Charleston church shooting in South Carolina, the theater 
        shooting in Lafayette, Louisiana, and the Isla Vista community 
        shootings in California;
            (10) since 2016, the country has witnessed 4 of the 10 most 
        deadly mass shootings in modern United States history;
            (11) in February 2018, 17 members of the Marjory Stoneman 
        Douglas High School community in Parkland, Florida, lost their 
        lives at the hands of a 19-year-old armed with an AR-15 
        semiautomatic assault rifle;
            (12) according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the 
        criminal homicide rate increased from 5.1 per 100,000 people in 
        2019 to 6.5 per 100,000 people in 2020, the largest single year 
        increase in at least the past 6 decades and approximately 73 
        percent of 2019 criminal homicides are estimated to have been 
        firearms-related, while approximately 77 percent of 2020 
        criminal homicides are estimated to have been firearms-related;
            (13) communities of color suffer disproportionately from 
        gun violence, with Black children and teens 14 percent more 
        likely to die of gun violence than their White counterparts and 
        Latino children and teens 3 times more likely to die of gun 
        violence than their White counterparts; and
            (14) between 2015 and 2020, there were 2,429 mass 
        shootings, including 611 in 2020 alone.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) firearms trafficking is prevalent and widespread in and 
        among the States, and it is usually impossible to distinguish 
        between intrastate trafficking and interstate trafficking; and
            (2) it is in the national interest and within the role of 
        the Federal Government to ensure that the regulation of 
        firearms is uniform among the States, that law enforcement can 
        quickly and effectively trace firearms used in crime, and that 
        firearms owners know how to use and safely store their 
        firearms.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act and the amendments made by 
this Act are--
            (1) to protect the public against the unreasonable risk of 
        injury and negligent or reckless death associated with the 
        unrecorded sale or transfer of qualifying firearms to criminals 
        and youths;
            (2) to ensure that owners of qualifying firearms are 
        knowledgeable in the safe use, handling, and storage of those 
        firearms;
            (3) to restrict the availability of qualifying firearms to 
        criminals, youth, and other persons prohibited by Federal law 
        from receiving firearms;
            (4) to facilitate the tracing of qualifying firearms used 
        in crime by Federal and State law enforcement agencies; and
            (5) to hold criminally and civilly liable those who 
        facilitate the transfer of qualifying firearms, causing risk of 
        injury and negligent or reckless death associated with the 
        transfer of those qualifying firearms.

    To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to treat diapers as 
     qualified medical expenses; and to prohibit States and local 
       governments to impose a tax on the retail sale of diapers.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Diaper Affordability Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) One in 3 families with infants and toddlers struggles 
        to provide the diapers their children need.
            (2) Low-income families with infants spend 14 percent of 
        their income on diapers alone, which is roughly $936 per child, 
        per year.
            (3) Low-income families spend twice as much on diapers for 
        their children, compared to families who have the means to buy 
        diapers in bulk at a lower price.
            (4) More than 5 million children under the typical potty 
        training age of 3-years-old live in low-income families.
            (5) Diaper need affects not only the health and well-being 
        of the child but it can affect the economic security of the 
        entire family.
            (6) Over half of families in diaper need who rely on child 
        care in order to go to work or school, missed work or school in 
        the preceding month because they did not have the diapers they 
        needed to put their child in child care.
            (7) No State or Federal child safety-net program allocates 
        dollars specifically for the purchase of diapers.
            (8) Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, diaper banks 
        around the country have experienced double, triple, or greater 
        increase in demand for diapers due to the pandemic and economic 
        shutdown.

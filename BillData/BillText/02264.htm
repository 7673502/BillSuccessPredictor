                    (A) shall provide coverage of the service provided 
                through telehealth at the same rate as the coverage for 
                the same service provided in-person (with the same 
                cost-sharing for enrollees and the same reimbursement 
                rates for providers);
                    (B) shall ensure that providers not charge

                    (C) may not impose additional barriers to obtaining 
                such coverage for such services through telehealth, 
                compared to coverage for such services provided in-
                person, such as a prior authorization requirement that 
                is more rigorous than for in-person visits; and
                    (D) shall provide notice to enrollees, informing 
                such enrollees of how to access in-network telehealth

            (2) Provider requirements.--During the applicable period 
        described in subsection (g), if a provider of a mental health

        telehealth to an enrollee in a group health plan or group or 
        individual health insurance coverage, the provider shall not

SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF POSSESSIONS.

    (a) Payments to Possessions.--
            (1) Mirror code possessions.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
        shall pay to each possession of the United States with a mirror 
        code tax system amounts equal to the loss to that possession by 
        reason of the amendments made by this Act. Such amounts shall 
        be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on 
        information provided by the government of the respective 
        possession of the United States.
            (2) Other possessions.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall 
        pay to each possession of the United States which does not have 
        a mirror code tax system the amount estimated by the Secretary 
        of the Treasury as being equal to the loss to that possession 
        that would have occurred by reason of the amendments made by 
        this Act if a mirror code tax system had been in effect in such 
        possession. The preceding sentence shall not apply with respect 
        to any possession of the United States unless such possession 
        establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the 
        possession has implemented (or, at the discretion of the 
        Secretary, will implement) an income tax benefit which is 
        substantially equivalent to the income tax credit in effect 
        after the amendments made by this Act.
    (b) Coordination With Credit Allowed Against United States Income 
Taxes.--The credit allowed against United States income taxes for any 
taxable year under the amendments made by this Act to section 51 of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to any person shall be reduced by the 
amount of any credit (or other tax benefit described in subsection 
(a)(2)) allowed to such person against income taxes imposed by the 
possession of the United States by reason of this section for such 
taxable year.
    (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--
            (1) Possession of the united states.--For purposes of this 
        section, the term ``possession of the United States'' shall 
        include such possessions as are specified in section 937(a)(1) 
        of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
            (2) Mirror code tax system.--For purposes of this section, 
        the term ``mirror code tax system'' means, with respect to any 
        possession of the United States, the income tax system of such 
        possession if the income tax liability of the residents of such 
        possession under such system is determined by reference to the 
        income tax laws of the United States as if such possession were 
        the United States.
            (3) Treatment of payments.--For purposes of section 
        1324(b)(2) of title 31, United States Code, the payments under 
        subsection (a) shall be treated in the same manner as a refund 
        due from credit provisions described in such section.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

has been discharged by the proceeds of such consolidation loan shall be 
treated as a monthly payment under this section on the portion of such 
consolidation loan that is attributable to such discharged loan, except 
that in the case of a subsequent consolidation loan, any monthly 
payment on a loan for which the liability has been discharged by the 
first consolidation loan shall not be applicable for the purposes of

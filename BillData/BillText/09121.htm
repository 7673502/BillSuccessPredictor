section 45Z the following new section:

``SEC. 45AA. QUALIFIED AGRICULTURAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION CREDIT.

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of section 38, in the case of a 
qualified applicant, the qualified agricultural carbon sequestration 
credit for the taxable year is an amount equal to the sum of--

            ``(1) In general.--The amount of the carbon dioxide 
        equivalent abatement credit for the taxable year shall be equal 
        to the applicable dollar amount per metric ton of qualified 
        carbon dioxide equivalent abatement by a qualified applicant.

        purposes of this subsection, the term `qualified carbon dioxide 
        equivalent abatement' means the amount (not less than zero)

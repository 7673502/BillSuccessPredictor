                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to expand the 
                   Magnet Schools Assistance Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Magnet schools Accessibility, 
Growth, and Nonexclusionary Enrollment Transformation Act of 2022'' or 
the ``MAGNET Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Studies have found that the academic benefits of 
        attending integrated schools for students of color include--
                    (A) higher achievement in mathematics, science, 
                language, and reading;
                    (B) school climates supportive of learning and 
                studying;
                    (C) increased likelihood of graduating from high 
                school and entering and graduating from college;
                    (D) higher income and educational attainment; and
                    (E) increased access to highly qualified teachers 
                and leaders who are less likely to transfer to other 
                schools.
            (2) The benefits of integrated schools extend to all 
        students regardless of race or socioeconomic background. On 
        average, students in socioeconomically and racially diverse 
        schools have stronger academic outcomes than students in 
        schools with concentrated poverty. Students in diverse schools 
        have higher test scores, are more likely to enroll in college, 
        and are less likely to drop out. Integrated schools help reduce 
        racial bias and counter stereotypes, as well as foster 
        friendships across diverse groups, improve students' 
        satisfaction and self-confidence, and enhance leadership 
        skills.
            (3) Students of color attending schools that are highly 
        segregated by race and poverty are deprived of the benefits of 
        integrated education. These schools are characterized by 
        resource inequities that translate into large proportions of 
        inexperienced and underprepared educators and a lack of 
        rigorous coursework, which have negative consequences for 
        students' academic outcomes as measured by performance on 
        standardized achievement tests and high school graduation 
        rates.
            (4) A 2019 study of every school district in the United 
        States found that higher racial segregation contributes to a 
        greater magnitude of achievement gaps in 3rd grade, and 
        increases the rate at which gaps grow from 3rd to 8th grade, 
        for students of color.
            (5) A 2016 Government Accountability Office analysis found 
        that a growing percentage of public elementary schools and 
        secondary schools in the Nation are hypersegregated, with 90 
        percent or more Black and Latino student populations and 
        students from low-income families.
            (6) A study reviewing 8 years of data from all United 
        States school districts found that racial segregation appears 
        to undermine achievement, in part, because it concentrates 
        minority students in high-poverty schools, which are, on 
        average, less effective than lower-poverty schools and tend to 
        be under-resourced.
            (7) Research shows that students' exposure to other 
        students from different backgrounds and the new ideas and 
        opportunities that such exposure brings leads to improved 
        critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Other benefits of 
        attending diverse schools include increased civic participation 
        in a diverse global economy and increased likelihood of living 
        in integrated neighborhoods and holding jobs in integrated 
        workplaces as adults.
            (8) Magnet schools have been effective in promoting school 
        diversity, especially when district demographics along with 
        magnet school design, structure, and focus (particularly the 
        centering of school integration in the school mission and the 
        design for family outreach) are a priority.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to amend the Magnet Schools Assistance 
Program under part D of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7231 et seq.)--
            (1) to create a supplemental diversity grant for aspiring 
        magnet school programs to adopt effective practices designed to 
        further desegregation aims and promote diversity; and
            (2) to supplement voluntary State efforts to promote inter-
        district diversity.

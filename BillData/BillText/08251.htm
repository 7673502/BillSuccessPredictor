                                 A BILL


 
    To authorize the National Science Foundation to make awards to 
   institutions of higher education and non-profit organizations for 
  research, development, and related activities to advance innovative 
   approaches to developing, improving, and expanding evidence-based 
  microelectronics education and workforce development activities and

                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Creating Helpful Initiatives to 
Produce Personnel In Needed Growth INdustries Act of 2022'' or the 
``CHIPPING IN Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) While microelectronics are a primary driver of economic 
        growth and scientific advancement, the United States has lost 
        much of its capacity to design and manufacture, test, and 
        package microelectronics and microelectronics systems 
        domestically.
            (2) Current educational and vocational training 
        opportunities are insufficient to meet the domestic 
        microelectronics industry workforce needs. The deficit between 
        open jobs and qualified workers is projected to grow as design 
        and manufacturing activities increase.
            (3) Growth in microelectronics design and manufacturing 
        capabilities may be limited by a lack of qualified workers.
            (4) The United States education pathways for 
        microelectronics faces significant challenges, from a lack of 
        gender and racial diversity to an inability of universities and 
        community colleges to attract and retain faculty and other 
        instructors qualified to teach microelectronics.
            (5) Students often fail to get the hands-on training they 
        need to succeed in microelectronics careers, especially at the 
        community or technical college level.
            (6) Skilled technical jobs in the manufacturing industry 
        and in the microelectronics design industry are well-suited for 
        apprenticeship and other paid training models, however 
        prospective participants must have adequate STEM training.
            (7) The microelectronics industry suffers from a lack of 
        awareness and visibility as pre-college students, students 
        pursuing STEM degrees, technical workers, and doctorate-level 
        researchers seek employment in other industries.
            (8) Lack of access to co-located design and fabrication 
        facilities, including attendant software licensing issues is a 
        deterrent for United States competitiveness and workforce 
        development.
            (9) In order to help drive forward advances in 
        microelectronics and increase domestic microelectronics design 
        and manufacturing capability, the Federal Government must 
        provide sufficient resources and use its convening power to 
        facilitate the growth of microelectronics talent in academia, 
        the Federal Government, and the microelectronics industry.

                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 22, 2022

                                Received

                                 AN ACT


 
  To amend title 3, United States Code, to reform the process for the 
          counting of electoral votes, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Presidential Election Reform Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Article II and the Twelfth Amendment to the 
        Constitution govern how our Republic selects the President and 
        Vice President of the United States. Article II provides that 
        ``each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature 
        may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of 
        Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled 
        in the Congress.'' (Constitution, article II, section 1, clause 
        2). Article II provides that Congress has the authority to 
        regulate the timing of such elections by setting the ``time'' 
        of the Presidential election and the ``day'' on which 
        presidential electors cast their votes (Constitution, article 
        II, section 1, clause 4). The Twelfth Amendment identifies 
        Congress' responsibility for counting electoral votes: ``The 
        President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate 
        and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the 
        votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest 
        number of votes for President, shall be the President, if such 
        number be a majority of the whole number of Electors 
        appointed.''. Congress' authorities in these respects are 
        further bolstered by the Necessary and Proper Clause of the 
        Constitution (article I, section 8, clause 18).
            (2) ``On January 6, 2021, a mob professing support for 
        then-President Trump violently attacked the United States 
        Capitol in an effort to prevent a Joint Session of Congress 
        from certifying the electoral college votes designating Joseph 
        R. Biden the 46th President of the United States.'' Trump v. 
        Thompson, 20 F.4th 10, 15 (D.C. Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 
        S. Ct. 1350 (2022). This constituted ``the single most deadly 
        attack on the Capitol by domestic forces in the history of the 
        United States.'' Trump, 20 F.4th at 35. ``Then-Vice President 
        Pence, Senators and Representatives were all forced to halt 
        their constitutional duties and flee . . . for safety.'' Id. at 
        16. ``The events of January 6, 2021 marked the most significant 
        assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.'' Id. at 18-19.
            (3) The Electoral Count Act of 1887 should be amended to 
        prevent other future unlawful efforts to overturn Presidential 
        elections and to ensure future peaceful transfers of 
        Presidential power.
            (4) The reforms contained in this Act are fully consistent 
        with States' constitutional authority vested by Article II to 
        appoint electors; the reforms herein do not restrict the mode 
        in which States lawfully appoint their respective electors or 
        resolve related contests or controversies, but instead ensure 
        that those appointments, and the votes cast by those electors, 
        are duly transmitted to Congress.

SEC. 3. TIMING OF APPOINTING ELECTORS.

    Section 1 of title 3, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``, in 
        accordance with State laws duly enacted prior to such day.''; 
        and
            (2) by striking ``in every fourth year succeeding every 
        election of a President and Vice President'' and inserting ``in 
        each year that is evenly divisible by four''.

SEC. 4. PERMITTING EXTENSION OF TIME FOR PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN EVENT 
              OF CATASTROPHIC EVENT POTENTIALLY AFFECTING OUTCOME.

    (a) Extension of Time for Election.--Section 2 of title 3, United 
States Code, is amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 2. Limited extension of time for appointing electors
    ``(a) Criteria for Extending Time for Voting in Presidential 
Elections.--If a State provides for the State's electors to be 
appointed by popular election pursuant to State laws duly enacted prior 
to the day fixed by section 1 of this title, the time for voting in 
such election shall, in accordance with the procedures described in 
subsection (b), be extended beyond the day fixed by section 1 of this 
title if a candidate for President who appears on the ballot in the 
State demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence in an action filed 
under subsection (b) that--
            ``(1) a catastrophic event has occurred in the State;
            ``(2) the catastrophic event has prevented a substantial 
        portion of the State's electorate from casting a ballot on such 
        day, or caused a substantial portion of ballots already cast to 
        be destroyed or rendered unreadable by such event without 
        sufficient notice to affected voters by such day; and
            ``(3) the number of voters prevented from casting a ballot 
        by such event, the number of ballots destroyed or rendered 
        unreadable by such event, or the total of both such numbers, is 
        sufficient in number to potentially affect the ability of that 
        candidate to win the election with respect to one or more 
        presidential electors.
    ``(b) Procedures.--
            ``(1) Authorizing filing of action by candidate.--A 
        candidate for President who appears on the ballot of the State, 
        and no other person, may file an action against the chief State 
        election official of the State in the district court of the 
        United States for the judicial district in which the capital of 
        the State is located to seek an extension of the time for 
        voting in the election under this section. Such district court 
        shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of any such 
        action.
            ``(2) Determination by three-judge court.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Any action under this subsection 
                shall be heard and determined by a court of 3 judges 
                convened pursuant to section 2284 of title 28, United 
                States Code, except that subsection (b)(2) of such 
                section shall not apply to any such action, and any 
                determination with respect to such an action shall be 
                reviewable only by appeal directly to the Supreme Court 
                of the United States.
                    ``(B) Expedited consideration.--It shall be the 
                duty of the district court described in paragraph (1) 
                and the Supreme Court of the United States to advance 
                on the docket and to expedite to the greatest extent 
                possible the disposition of any action or appeal under 
                this subsection.
            ``(3) Criteria for decision.--The court shall require the 
        time for voting in the election to be extended under this 
        section only if the court finds by clear and convincing 
        evidence that the criteria of subsection (a) are met.
            ``(4) Scope of extended voting period.--
                    ``(A) Period of extension.--If the court finds that 
                the criteria of subsection (a) are met, the court 
                shall, except as provided in subparagraph (C), order an 
                extended voting period that shall be for the shortest 
                duration necessary in light of the catastrophic event 
                justifying the extension, so long as such extended 
                voting period concludes not later than 5 days after the 
                day fixed by section 1 of this title.
                    ``(B) Implementation of extension.-- The time for 
                voting in an election which is extended under this 
                section shall only be extended in the area in the State 
                specifically and directly affected by the catastrophic 
                event, and, to the extent practicable, all ballots cast 
                on or prior to the day fixed by section 1 of this title 
                that are otherwise valid under State law duly enacted 
                prior to such day shall be counted, and voters who cast 
                such ballots shall not be required to take further 
                action to take into account the extension of time for 
                the election under this section.
                    ``(C) Impossibility of implementation.--If the 
                court finds that the criteria of subsection (a) are 
                met, but that it is impossible for the State to 
                administer an extended voting period as a result of the 
                catastrophic event, the court shall issue a declaratory 
                judgment to that effect and, to the extent practicable, 
                all ballots cast on or prior to the day fixed by 
                section 1 of this title that are otherwise valid under 
                State law duly enacted prior to such day shall be 
                counted.
            ``(5) Right to intervene.--Only a candidate for President 
        who appears on the ballot of the State may intervene in an 
        action filed with respect to the State under this subsection.
            ``(6) Sanctions.--If, on the court's own initiative or the 
        motion of a party, the court finds that the candidate filing an 
        action under this subsection did not have a good-faith basis 
        for the factual or legal contentions asserted in the action, 
        the candidate's attorneys of record and their law firms shall 
        be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to 3 times 
        the full attorney's fees and other expenses incurred by each 
        other party to the action.
            ``(7) Deadline.--
                    ``(A) In general.--An action under this subsection 
                must be filed not later than the day after the day 
                fixed for the election by section 1 of this title.
                    ``(B) Exception.--If the catastrophic event 
                prevents the appropriate court from accepting the 
                filing of an action under this subsection, the action 
                must be filed in another district court of the United 
                States capable of accepting the filing most proximate 
                to the judicial district in which the capital of the 
                State is located.
            ``(8) Chief state election official defined.--In this 
        subsection, the term `chief State election official' has the 
        meaning given such term in section 253(e) of the Help America 
        Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. 21003(e)).
    ``(c) Catastrophic Event Defined.--
            ``(1) Definition.--In this section, the term `catastrophic 
        event' means a major natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or 
        a widespread power outage, so long as such event is on a scale 
        sufficient to prevent a substantial portion of a State's 
        electorate from casting a ballot on the day fixed by section 1 
        of this title, or such event causes a substantial number of 
        ballots already cast in a State to be destroyed or rendered 
        unreadable.
            ``(2) Other definitions.--In paragraph (1)--
                    ``(A) the term `act of terrorism' means an activity 
                that involves acts dangerous to human life that are a 
                violation of the criminal laws of the United States or 
                of any State, and that appear to be intended--
                            ``(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian 
                        population;

                    ``(A) The State in question was not validly a State 
                at the time its electors cast their electoral votes and 
                is thus not entitled to such votes, except that such 
                objection may not be raised with respect to the 
                District of Columbia.
                    ``(B) The State in question submitted more votes 
                than it is constitutionally entitled to, and thus a 
                corresponding number of its purported votes should be 
                rejected.
                    ``(C) One or more of the State's electors are 
                constitutionally ineligible for the office of elector

                the authority described in section 4 of this title 
                prior to the casting of electoral votes by its 
                electors, then it shall not be in order to cite the 
                initial appointment of the ineligible elector as 
                grounds for raising an objection under this 
                subparagraph.

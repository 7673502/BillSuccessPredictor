                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 51, United States Code, to direct the Administrator of 
   the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to establish an 
   initiative to conduct research, development, and demonstration on 
  technologies capable of reducing both greenhouse gas emissions and 
         noise emissions from aircraft, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Air travel currently contributes approximately 3 
        percent to global carbon emissions, but emissions from this 
        sector are expected to triple by 2050.
            (2) A healthy, thriving aviation sector contributes to the 
        quality of life and economic well-being of the United States. 
        In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration found that civil 
        aviation accounted for 5.2 percent of the United States gross 
        domestic product, generated $1.8 trillion, and supported 
        10,900,000 jobs.
            (3) Existing aircraft technologies contribute to noise 
        pollution that has adverse impacts on the quality of life in 
        affected communities. As air traffic volumes increase and the 
        adoption of performance-based navigation technology proceeds, 
        the problem of noise pollution is becoming more severe in some 
        areas.
            (4) The United States has adopted a goal of net-zero 
        greenhouse gas emissions from the United States aviation sector 
        by 2050.
            (5) Research on technologies to lessen the environmental 
        and noise impacts of aviation is ongoing, but should 
        accelerate, and should include work on the further maturation 
        and integration of multiple enabling technologies on production 
        aircraft, including novel integrated systems at the aircraft 
        level.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION INITIATIVE ON 
              REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS AND NOISE EMISSIONS FROM 
              AIRCRAFT.

    (a) Initiative Required.--Section 40112 of title 51, United States 
Code, is amended--

        dioxide, (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), other greenhouse gases, 
        water vapor, black carbon and sulfate aerosols, increased 
        cloudiness due to contrail formation, noise emissions from 
        aircraft, and to enable associated aircraft performance 
        characteristics.
            ``(2) Goals.--The goals of the initiative shall be to--
                    ``(A) ensure United States leadership in research

                emissions;
                    ``(B) enhance and expand basic research, and the 
                translation of basic research into applications, that

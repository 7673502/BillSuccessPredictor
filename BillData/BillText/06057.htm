taxable year--
            (1) demonstrate that such individual is a non-resident for

        7701(b)(3) of such Code,

            (6) declare United States source income from retirement, 
        pension and social security benefits to be treated as resourced 
        from treaty income where tax has been paid upon distribution.
    (b) Specified Individual.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term 
        ``specified individual'' means, with respect to a taxable year,

                the substantial presence test of section 7701(b)(3), or 
                is the spouse of non-resident citizen, and

                beginning after 2023, the $400,000 amount in paragraph 
                (1)(B)(i) shall be increased by an amount equal to--
                            (i) such dollar amount, multiplied by
                            (ii) the cost-of-living adjustment 
                        determined under section 1(f)(3) for the 
                        calendar year in which the taxable year begins,

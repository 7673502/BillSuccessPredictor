SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In 2022, the world is in the midst of the worst global 
        displacement crisis in history, with more than 103,000,000 
        forcibly displaced persons, including more than 32,500,000 
        refugees worldwide, nearly half of whom are children, according 
        to estimates from the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees.
            (2) In 2023, the United Nations High Commissioner for 
        Refugees estimates that global resettlement needs will 
        significantly increase to 2,003,982 individuals, as compared to 
        2022--
                    (A) in which 1,473,156 individuals were estimated 
                to be in need of third-country resettlement; and
                    (B) during the first 6 months of which 42,300 
                individuals were resettled worldwide.
            (3) The United States refugee admissions program is a life-
        saving solution that--
                    (A) is critical to global humanitarian efforts;
                    (B) strengthens global security;
                    (C) leverages United States foreign policy 
                interests, including diplomatic and strategic interests 
                of supporting allies who often host a significant and 
                disproportionate share of refugees per capita; and
                    (D) stabilizes sensitive regions impacted by forced 
                migration by ensuring that the United States shares 
                responsibility for global refugee protection;
                    (E) leverages refugee resettlement in the United 
                States to encourage other countries to uphold the human 
                rights of refugees, including by ensuring that 
                refugees--
                            (i) have the right to work, the right to an 
                        education, and freedom of movement; and
                            (ii) are not returned to a place in which 
                        their life or freedom is at risk;
                    (F) serves individuals and families in need of 
                resettlement;
                    (G) provides economic and cultural benefits to 
                cities, States, and the United States as a whole; and
                    (H) aligns with the international obligations of 
                the United States, including under--
                            (i) the Convention Relating to the Status 
                        of Refugees, done at Geneva July 28, 1951 (as 
                        made applicable by the Protocol Relating to the 
                        Status of Refugees, done at New York January 
                        31, 1967 (19 UST 6223)), of which the United 
                        States is a party;
                            (ii) the Convention against Torture and 
                        Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
                        Punishment, done at New York December 10, 1984, 
                        of which the United States is a party;
                            (iii) the Convention relating to the Status 
                        of Stateless Persons, done at New York 
                        September 28, 1954; and
                            (iv) the Convention on the Reduction of 
                        Statelessness, done at New York August 30, 
                        1961.
            (4) The United States has historically been, and should 
        continue to be, a global leader in--
                    (A) responding to displacement crises around the 
                world, including through the provision of robust 
                humanitarian support;
                    (B) promoting the safety, health, and well-being of 
                refugees and displaced persons;
                    (C) welcoming asylum seekers who seek safety and 
                protecting other at-risk migrants, including survivors 
                of torture, victims of trafficking, climate displaced 
                persons, and stateless people; and
                    (D) working alongside other countries to strengthen 
                protection systems and support.
            (5) The United States has steadily reduced access to asylum 
        protection through administrative policy and programmatic 
        changes, including policies and operational decisions aimed at 
        reducing or stopping the ability of asylum seekers to access 
        the United States border.
            (6) Refugees are--
                    (A) the most vetted travelers to enter the United 
                States; and
                    (B) subject to extensive screening checks, 
                including in-person interviews, biometric data checks, 
                and multiple interagency checks.
            (7) For the sake of refugees, asylum seekers, other 
        migrants, United States national diplomatic and strategic 
        interests, and local communities that benefit from the presence 
        of refugees, asylees, and other migrants, it is crucial for the 
        United States to better protect refugees and asylum seekers 
        through reforms, including--
                    (A) asylum reforms that ensure access to territory 
                and due process;
                    (B) reforms to border migration enforcement, 
                management, and adjudication systems that integrate 
                stronger protection of, and ensure due process for, 
                asylum seekers, children, victims of trafficking, 
                climate displaced persons, stateless people, and other 
                migrants, including--
                            (i) community-based alternatives to 
                        detention for asylum seekers and other 
                        vulnerable migrants;
                            (ii) improved detention conditions and 
                        reduced reliance on immigrant detention;
                            (iii) monitoring to ensure fairness in the 
                        arrest and adjudication process;
                            (iv) increased access to legal information 
                        and representation; and
                            (v) a stronger commitment to child welfare 
                        in staffing and processes; and
                    (C) refugee reforms that--
                            (i) ensure that the United States meets the 
                        annual refugee admissions goal;
                            (ii) prevent refugee policy that 
                        discriminates based on race or religion;
                            (iii) improve opportunities for refugees to 
                        achieve family unity; and
                            (iv) update and strengthen support for 
                        refugees and the communities that welcome 
                        refugees.
            (8) The people of the United States, and communities across 
        the United States, overwhelmingly support refugees and asylum 
        seekers, including people of faith, members of the Armed 
        Forces, veterans, elected officials, and retired high-ranking 
        officials.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the global refugee crisis is dire and requires 
        international and regional cooperation and action; and
            (2) the United States should--
                    (A) assert strong leadership in multilateral fora, 
                such as the United Nations, by collaborating and 
                cooperating with other countries and international and 
                regional organizations to develop a comprehensive and 
                coordinated response to the global refugee crisis; and
                    (B) exercise leadership in efforts to address the 
                global refugee crisis, including through participation 
                in the Global Refugee Forum.

        or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, 
        that country because of persecution, or a well-founded fear of 
        persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, 
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; 
        or
            ``(ii) in such circumstances as the President may specify, 
        after appropriate consultation (as defined in section 207(e))--
                    ``(I) is within the country of such person's 
                nationality or, in the case of a person having no 
                nationality, within the country in which such person is 
                habitually residing; and
                    ``(II) is persecuted, or who has a well-founded 
                fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, 
                nationality, membership in a particular social group, 
                or political opinion.
    ``(B) The term `refugee' does not include any person who ordered, 
incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the persecution of any 
person on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a 
particular social group, or political opinion. A person who establishes 
that his or her actions were committed under duress or while the person 
was younger than 18 years of age shall not be considered to have 
ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in persecution 
under this subparagraph.
    ``(C) The term `political opinion' refers to any expression of 
support for or dissent from, or imputed support for or dissent from, a 
practice, policy, or ideology of a government entity or of a nonstate 
group or actor.
    ``(D) For purposes of determinations under this Act--
            ``(i) a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or 
        to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been 
        persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure 
        or for other resistance to a coercive population control 
        program, shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of 
        political opinion;
            ``(ii) a person who has a well-founded fear that he or she 
        will be forced to undergo such a procedure or be subject to 
        persecution for such failure, refusal, or resistance shall be 
        deemed to have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of 
        political opinion;
            ``(iii) the term `particular social group' means, without 
        any additional requirement not listed below, any group whose 
        members--

                        or fundamental to identity, conscience, or the 
                        exercise of human rights; or

that the applicant is a refugee.
    ``(ii) To establish that the applicant is a refugee, persecution--
            ``(I) shall be on account of race, religion, nationality, 
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; 
        and
            ``(II) may be established by demonstrating that--
                    ``(aa) a protected ground is at least one reason 
                for the applicant's persecution or fear of persecution;
                    ``(bb) the persecution or feared persecution would 
                not have occurred or would not occur in the future but

                will have the effect of harming the person because of a 
                protected ground.
    ``(F) Where past or feared persecution by a nonstate actor is 
unrelated to a protected asylum ground, the causal nexus link is 
established if the state's failure to protect the asylum applicant from 
the nonstate actor is on account of a protected asylum ground.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 208(b)(1) of the Immigration and 
Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1158(b)(1)) is amended by striking ``section 
101(a)(42)(A)'' each place such term appears and inserting ``section 
101(a)(42)(A)(i)''.

        documentary evidence as the Secretary of State may require.
    ``(III) The district director or immigration court shall attempt to 
adjudicate each petition under this clause before the last day of the 
fiscal year for which the petitioner was selected. Notwithstanding 
clause (ii)(II), if the district director or immigration court is 
unable to complete such adjudication during such fiscal year, the 
adjudication and adjustment of status of the petitioner may take place

        Secretary of State made in consultation with the Secretary of 
        Homeland Security, and after appropriate consultation, may

        category of aliens established under clause (ii) whose 
        resettlement in the United States is justified by humanitarian 
        concerns or is otherwise in the national interest and who share 
        common characteristics that identify such aliens as targets of 
        persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, 
        membership in a particular social group, or political opinion 
        or who otherwise have a shared need for resettlement due to a 
        specific vulnerability.

        a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, 
        religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, 
        or political opinion, unless the Secretary determines that such

SEC. 1403. PRESUMPTION OF LIBERTY FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS.

    (a) Custody Determination.--
            (1) Initial determination.--
                    (A) In general.--With respect to an alien who has 
                expressed fear of returning to his or her home country 
                or an intent to apply for asylum in the United States, 
                the Secretary shall make an initial written custody 
                determination with respect to the alien and provide the 
                determination to the alien not later than 48 hours 
                after, as applicable--
                            (i) the Secretary takes the alien into 
                        custody; or
                            (ii) in the case of an alien already in the 
                        custody of the Secretary, the alien expresses 
                        such fear or intent.
                    (B) Least restrictive conditions.--A custody 
                determination under this paragraph shall impose the 
                least restrictive conditions if the Secretary 
                determines that the release of an alien--
                            (i) will not reasonably ensure the 
                        appearance of the alien as required; or
                            (ii) will endanger the safety of any other 
                        person or the community.
                    (C) Applicability.--This paragraph shall not apply 
                to unaccompanied alien children (as defined in section 
                462(g) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 
                279g)).
            (2) Presumption of release.--
                    (A) In general.--In a hearing under this 
                subsection, there shall be a presumption that the alien 
                should be released.
                    (B) Rebuttal.--The Secretary may rebut the 
                presumption of release based on clear and convincing 
                evidence, including credible and individualized 
                information, that--
                            (i) the use of alternatives to detention, 
                        including release on recognizance or on a 
                        reasonable bond, will not reasonably ensure the 
                        appearance of the alien at removal proceedings; 
                        or
                            (ii) the alien is a threat to another 
                        person or the community.
                    (C) Pending criminal charge.--A pending criminal 
                charge against an alien may not be the sole factor to 
                justify the continued detention of the alien.
                    (D) Evidence of identity.--The inability of an 
                alien to reasonably provide government-issued evidence 
                of identity, including the inability of the alien to 
                contact the government of the country of nationality of 
                the alien so as not to alert such government of the 
                whereabouts of the alien, may not be the sole factor to 
                justify the continued detention of the alien.
                    (E) Pre-existing community ties.--A lack of pre-
                existing community ties in the United States shall not 
                preclude the release of an alien.
    (b) Least Restrictive Conditions Required.--
            (1) In general.--If the Secretary or an immigration judge 
        determines, pursuant to a hearing under this section, that the 
        release of an alien will not reasonably ensure the appearance 
        of the alien as required or will endanger the safety of any 
        other person or the community, the Secretary or the immigration 
        judge shall order the least restrictive conditions or 
        combination of conditions that the Secretary or judge 
        determines will reasonably ensure the appearance of the alien 
        and the safety of any other person and the community, which may 
        include--
                    (A) release on recognizance;
                    (B) secured or unsecured release on bond; or
                    (C) participation in a program described in 
                subsection (d).
            (2) Monthly review.--Any condition assigned to an alien 
        under paragraph (1) shall be reviewed by an immigration judge 
        on a monthly basis.
    (c) Special Rule for Vulnerable Persons and Primary Caregivers.--
            (1) In general.--In the case that the alien who is the 
        subject of a custody determination under this section is a 
        vulnerable person or a primary caregiver, the alien may not be 
        detained unless the Secretary demonstrates, in addition to the 
        requirements under subsection (a)(2), that it is unreasonable 
        or not practicable to place the individual in a community-based 
        supervision program.
            (2) Definitions.--In this subsection:
                    (A) Material witness.--The term ``material

                to the best of the declarant's knowledge and belief, 
                reasonable cause exists to believe that the testimony 
                of the individual will be relevant to the outcome of 
                the workplace claim.

                populations within the mandate of the Office of Refugee 
                Resettlement, with respect to digital literacy, equity, 
                and inclusion.

        described in paragraph (1).
    (c) Requirements.--The United States-based filer shall be at least 
18 years of age at the time that the AOR is filed. The filer shall file 
the AOR not later than 5 years after the date they were admitted as a

        qualifying individual to file for Priority 3 access for a 
        partner of any gender if the filer can provide evidence of a 
        relationship with the partner for at least one year overseas 
        prior to the submission of the AOR and considered that person 
        to be his or her spouse or life partner, and that the 
        relationship is ongoing, together with evidence that legal 
        marriage was not an obtainable option due to social or legal 
        prohibitions.
    (e) Derivative Refugee Status.--In addition to the qualifying 
family members of a United States-based individual identified above, 
the qualifying family member's spouse and unmarried children younger

applicant for refugee status.
    (f) Additional Qualifying Family Members.--
            (1) In general.--On a case-by-case basis, an individual may

                or, if stateless, last habitual residence; and
                    (C) demonstrates exceptional and compelling 
                humanitarian circumstances that justify inclusion on 
                the qualifying family member's case.
            (2) Refugee status independent from principal applicant.--
        To be added to a qualifying family member's case under 
        paragraph (1), an individual described in paragraph (1) shall 
        independently establish that they are refugees.
    (g) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in collaboration with 
the Secretary of State, shall submit a report to Congress that--

        personnel so as to maintain a capacity to complete RAVU within 
        30 days of receipt of each case; and
            (3) includes the following data as of the first day of each

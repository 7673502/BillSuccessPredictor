SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Helicopter Safety and Noise 
Management Act''.

SEC. 2. HELICOPTER USAGE MANAGEMENT PLAN.

    (a) Commission for Development of Rotocraft Management Plan.--At 
least 2 Governors and 1 Mayor with jurisdiction over covered airspace 
shall--
            (1) jointly establish a commission to develop the 
        helicopter usage management plan required under subsection (b);

        nonessential helicopter flights.
    (b) Development of Plan.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the commission established under subsection (a) 
shall develop a helicopter usage management plan for covered airspace 
that--
            (1) prohibits the operation of a nonessential civil 
        rotorcraft in covered airspace without a permit described under 
        subsection (c) from the Federal Aviation Administration;
            (2) establishes a system for substantially reducing the 
        number of nonessential civil rotorcraft that can operate in 
        covered airspace at any given time; and
            (3) establishes a competitive bidding program for civil 
        nonessential rotocrafts to operate in such airspace.
    (c) Number of Nonessential Rotorcrafts Authorized.--In determining 
the number of nonessential rotorcrafts authorized under the competitive 
bidding program established under subsection (b)(3), the commission 
shall take into consideration--

        or pilots employed by the person;
            (2) any quiet aircraft technology to be used by the person 
        submitting the proposal;
            (3) the experience of the person submitting the proposal

            (4) the financial capability of the person submitting the 
        proposal;
            (5) any training programs for pilots provided by the person 
        submitting the proposal; and
            (6) the number of existing nonessential rotorcrafts 
        authorized and the current level of service and equipment 
        provided by any such operators.
    (d) Public Comment Period.--
            (1) In general.--The commission established under 
        subsection (a) shall provide notice of, and an opportunity for,

        public hearings in the communities impacted by the plan 
        described in subsection (b) to solicit feedback with respect to 
        the helicopter usage management plan.
    (e) Establishment of Plan and Permit.--The Administrator shall--
            (1) implement the helicopter usage management plan 
        established under subsection (b); and
            (2) establish a permit system referred to in subsection 
        (b)(1) under which owners or operators of nonessential civil 
        rotorcraft are required to hold a valid permit from the 
        Administrator to operate such rotocraft in covered airspace.
    (f) Essential Use.--
            (1) Public health and safety.--The plan developed under 
        subsection (b) shall not apply any limitation or requirement to 
        the operation of a civil rotorcraft for purposes of public 
        health and safety, including--
                    (A) law enforcement;

people per square mile, including the airspace over any waterways 
considered within the limits of such city.

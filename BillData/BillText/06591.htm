                    (A) the criteria set forth in the document entitled 
                ``Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 1: 2020 
                Criteria for Recognition as a Flushable Product'', 
                published by the International Water Services 
                Flushability Group and dated December 2020 (or any 
                appropriate successor criteria, as determined by the 
                Administrator), and any relevant voluntary consensus 
                standards, or other standards, determined appropriate 
                by the Administrator; and
                    (B) consideration of--
                            (i) the environmental impact of flushing 
                        the product, based on the composition of the 
                        materials in the product;
                            (ii) the toilet and drain clearance ability 
                        of the product;
                            (iii) the disintegration of the product;
                            (iv) how the product settles in the waste 
                        system; and
                            (v) the biodegradation of the product; and
            (2) establishes a process to assess whether a disposable 
        nonwoven product conforms to the standards established under 
        paragraph (1), including a requirement that in order for a 
        disposable nonwoven product to be designated or marked 
        ``flushable'' or ``sewer and septic safe'', or with any other 
        representation that depicts the disposable nonwoven product as 
        suitable for toilet disposal, the manufacturer of the 
        disposable nonwoven product shall--
                    (A) submit to the Administrator--
                            (i) documentation demonstrating that the 
                        disposable nonwoven product conforms to such 
                        standards; and
                            (ii) a fee in an amount determined 
                        appropriate by the Administrator to cover the 
                        costs of administering this section; and
                    (B) make public the documentation submitted 
                pursuant to subparagraph (A)(i).
    (b) Product Designation or Marking.--Beginning on the effective 
date of the rule published under subsection (a), a covered entity may 
use the terms ``flushable'' or ``sewer and septic safe'', or any other 
representation that depicts a disposable nonwoven product as suitable 
for toilet disposal, to designate or mark a disposable nonwoven product 
only if--
            (1) the disposable nonwoven product conforms to the 
        standards established under subsection (a)(1); and
            (2) the manufacturer of the disposable nonwoven product is 
        in compliance with the process established under subsection 
        (a)(2) with respect to the disposable nonwoven product.
    (c) Compliance.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator may, in consultation

                    (A) a requirement to submit a third-party 
                verification that a disposable nonwoven product 
                conforms to the standards established under subsection 
                (a)(1) if the Administrator determines that the 
                documentation submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(2) 
                is insufficient, or further information is otherwise 
                necessary, to verify such compliance; and

                may, with respect to any covered entity that violates 
                subsection (b), issue an order to comply, or bring an 
                action in an appropriate United States district court 
                for appropriate injunctive relief.

        amounts collected by the Administrator pursuant to this 
        section.

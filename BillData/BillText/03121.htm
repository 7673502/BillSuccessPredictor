shall--
            (1) seek to enter into one or more memoranda of 
        understanding with one or more eligible civilian child care 
        centers or facilities to reserve slots for qualified families 
        in locations in which--
                    (A) the Department of Defense lacks a child 
                development center; or
                    (B) the wait lists for the nearest Department of 
                Defense child development center, where applicable,

                accommodated; and
            (2) select five locations that the Secretary determines 
        have the greatest unmet demand for child care services for 
        children of members of the Armed Forces, including at least one 
        facility in each location that offers extended or flexible 
        hours to provide care after hours and on weekends.
    (c) Annual Assessment of Results.--Not later than one year after

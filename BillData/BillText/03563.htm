SEC. 2. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION.

    (a) In General.--Section 223(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 is amended by adding at the end the following:
                    ``(F) Preventive care services and items for 
                chronic conditions.--For purposes of subparagraph (C)--
                            ``(i) preventive care shall include any 
                        service or item used to treat an individual 
                        with a chronic condition if--
                                    ``(I) such service or item is low-
                                cost,
                                    ``(II) in regards to such service 
                                or item, there is medical evidence 
                                supporting high cost efficiency of 
                                preventing exacerbation of the chronic 
                                condition or the development of a 
                                secondary condition, and
                                    ``(III) there is a strong 
                                likelihood, documented by clinical 
                                evidence, that with respect to the 
                                class of individuals utilizing such 
                                service or item, the specific service 
                                or use of the item will prevent the 
                                exacerbation of the chronic condition 
                                or the development of a secondary 
                                condition that requires significantly 
                                higher cost treatments, and
                            ``(ii) an individual who has been 
                        prescribed preventive care for any chronic 
                        condition may be presumed to have been 
                        diagnosed with such condition if such 
                        preventive care is customarily prescribed for 
                        such condition.''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section shall apply 
to coverage for months beginning after the date of the enactment of 
this Act.

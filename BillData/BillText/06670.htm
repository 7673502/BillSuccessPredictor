                                 A BILL


 
To permit employees to request changes to their work schedules without 
    fear of retaliation and to ensure that employers consider these 
  requests, and to require employers to provide more predictable and 
stable schedules for employees in certain occupations with evidence of 
unpredictable and unstable scheduling practices that negatively affect 
                   employees, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Schedules That 
Work Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The vast majority of the United States workforce today 
        is juggling responsibilities at home and at work. Women are 
        primary breadwinners or co-breadwinners in \2/3\ of families 
        with children in the United States.
            (2) Despite the dual responsibilities of today's workforce, 
        many workers have little notice of their work schedules and 
        lack the ability to make changes to the work hours in such 
        schedules, which undermines their ability to accommodate family 
        responsibilities.
            (3)(A) Mothers working in low-paid jobs are more likely to 
        be the primary or sole breadwinner for their families than 
        mothers working in higher-paid jobs. For example, nearly 7 in 
        10 mothers in the \1/5\ of households in the United States with 
        the lowest incomes bring home all or most of their families' 
        income, compared to less than \1/3\ of their counterparts in 
        the highest-income quintile.
            (B) At the same time, low-paid workers often have the least 
        control over their work hours and face the most unpredictable 
        schedules. In some industries, ``just-in-time'' scheduling 
        practices, which base workers' schedules on perceived consumer 
        demand to minimize labor costs, are particularly common. 
        Employers using these practices often post work schedules with 
        little notice, vary work hours widely from week to week, cancel 
        shifts at the last minute, and schedule employees for ``on 
        call'' shifts (requiring an employee to call in to work to find 
        out whether the employee will have to work later that day) or 
        ``clopening'' shifts (requiring an employee to work a closing 
        shift at night followed by an opening shift a few hours later). 
        For example, national survey data show that--
                    (i) about \2/3\ of hourly retail and food service 
                workers receive their work schedules with less than 2 
                weeks' advance notice and about \1/3\ receive their 
                schedule with less than 1 week's notice;
                    (ii) more than 1 in 5 hourly retail and food 
                service workers have been scheduled for on-call shifts, 
                and more than 1 in 3 have worked ``clopening'' shifts; 
                and
                    (iii) 65 percent of hourly retail and food service 
                workers would like a more stable and predictable 
                schedule.
            (4) Unfair work scheduling practices make it difficult for 
        low-paid workers to--
                    (A) provide necessary care for children and other 
                family members, including securing and maintaining 
                stable child care;
                    (B) access and receive needed care for the workers' 
                own serious health conditions;
                    (C) pursue workforce training;
                    (D) get or keep a second job, which many workers 
                need to make ends meet;
                    (E) plan for and access transportation to reach 
                worksites; and
                    (F) qualify for and maintain eligibility for needed 
                public benefits and work supports, such as child care 
                subsidies and benefits under the supplemental nutrition 
                assistance program, due to fluctuations in income and 
                work hours.
            (5) Unstable work schedules pre-date the pandemic and 
        economic recession caused by COVID-19, but the harm of these 
        workplace practices is exacerbated as millions of workers risk 
        their own health and safety at jobs with few protections, 
        volatile schedules, and inadequate hours, in an effort to 
        support themselves and their families. Employers have continued 
        to use ``just-in-time'' scheduling practices throughout the 
        pandemic, even as workers face additional caregiving challenges 
        due to school and child care closures and quarantines.
            (6) A growing body of research demonstrates that unstable 
        and unpredictable work schedules have significant detrimental 
        impacts on sleep quality, mental health, and happiness, and are 
        associated with unstable child care arrangements and negative 
        health and behavioral outcomes for children. And impacts are 
        likely to be the most severe for workers of color and their 
        families, as workers of color are more likely than their White 
        counterparts--even compared to White coworkers at the same 
        company--to experience unstable work schedules. Unstable and 
        unpredictable work schedules--and the work-family conflict they 
        produce--are also associated with higher rates of turnover, 
        which creates further instability for employers and workers. 
        Some examples of the detrimental impacts of unstable and 
        unpredictable work schedules are as follows:
                    (A) Unstable work schedules lead to more household 
                economic strain and time conflicts and undermine the 
                well-being of parents, all of which can negatively 
                impact children's health and behavior.
                    (B) Workers with the most severe instability in 
                their work schedules also face the highest risk of 
                negative behavior and health outcomes for their 
                children.
                    (C) The exposure of a parent to on-call shifts and 
                last-minute shift changes are associated with more 
                unstable child care arrangements and with the use of 
                siblings to provide care.
                    (D) Work schedule instability causes more work-
                family conflict, which increases the chance that a 
                worker will be forced to leave his or her job, which is 
                associated with downward mobility of the earnings of 
                the worker.
                    (E)(i) Relative to White workers, workers of color 
                are more likely to--
                            (I) have cancelled shifts;
                            (II) have on-call shifts;
                            (III) be involuntary part-time workers;
                            (IV) have trouble getting time off; and
                            (V) work ``clopening'' shifts, as described 
                        in paragraph (3)(B).
                    (ii) The statistics described in clause (i) remain 
                true after controlling for demographics, human capital, 
                worker power, firm segregation, and discordance with 
                the race or ethnicity of the worker and the manager. 
                Race gaps in job quality are greater for women of 
                color.
                    (F) Workers who receive shorter advanced notice, 
                who work on-call shifts, who experience last-minute 
                shift cancellation and timing changes, or with more 
                volatile work hours are more likely to experience 
                hunger, residential hardships, and more overall 
                economic hardship.
            (7) Unpredictable and unstable work schedules are common in 
        a wide range of occupations, with evidence of particular 
        concentration in food service, retail, cleaning, hospitality, 
        and warehouse occupations. These occupations are critically 
        important to the United States economy.
            (8) Employers that have implemented fair work scheduling 
        policies that allow workers to have more control over their 
        work schedules, and provide more predictable and stable 
        schedules, have experienced significant benefits, including 
        reductions in absenteeism and workforce turnover, and increased 
        worker morale and engagement. For example, when Gap Inc. 
        piloted strategies to make work schedules more stable and 
        predictable for employees, the Gap Inc. stores that implemented 
        these strategies experienced higher productivity and a 7 
        percent increase in sales, compared to those Gap Inc. stores 
        that did not implement these strategies.
            (9) This Act is a first step in responding to the needs of 
        workers for a voice in the timing of their work hours and for 
        more predictable schedules.

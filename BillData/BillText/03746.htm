     benchmarking process for the Medicare Shared Savings Program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Accountable Care in Rural America 
Act''.

SEC. 2. EXCLUSION OF MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE BENEFICIARIES ASSIGNED TO 
              AN ACO FROM ASPECTS OF OTHER PAYMENT MODELS IN CERTAIN 
              CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING DETERMINATION OF REGIONAL 
              ADJUSTMENTS.

    Section 1899(i)(3) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395jjj(i)(3)) is amended--
            (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``subparagraph (B)'' 
        and inserting ``subparagraphs (B) and (C)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:
                    ``(C) Exclusion of assigned beneficiaries in 
                certain circumstances including determination of 
                regional adjustments.--For performance periods 
                beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this 
                subparagraph, in determining any shared savings for any 
                ACO under a model described in this paragraph, the 
                Secretary shall--
                            ``(i) remove Medicare fee-for-service 
                        beneficiaries who are assigned to that ACO from 
                        the methodology for calculating regional 
                        expenditures used to establish, update, and 
                        adjust the benchmark expenditures; and
                            ``(ii) otherwise ensure that no such ACO is 
                        in a less favorable financial position due to 
                        differences between the share of Medicare fee-
                        for-service beneficiaries assigned to the ACO 
                        of all such beneficiaries in the counties an 
                        ACO operates in compared to the share of such 
                        beneficiaries assigned to other ACOs.''.

                                 A BILL


 
         To establish the Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``National 
Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic Act''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused immense 
        suffering in the United States, having resulted in more than 
        736,000 American deaths as of October 2021, and infecting at 
        least 45,000,000;
            (2) following other destructive and traumatic events in our 
        history, including the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, 
        Congress has established a bipartisan commission of experts to 
        study the event and produce a report and recommendations, and 
        such an exercise can assist in national healing;
            (3) the extent of the loss of life and the economic cost of 
        the pandemic demonstrate the high risks that pandemic diseases 
        can pose to public health and to national security, and demands 
        a thorough, authoritative, and independent review of the origin 
        of SARS-CoV-2 as well as United States actions and policies 
        before and during the pandemic, and recommendations to Congress 
        and policymakers as to how we can be better prepared for future 
        pandemic diseases, including those that could be caused by 
        intentional biological attacks;
            (4) individuals appointed to the Commission established in 
        subsection (b) should be prominent citizens of the United 
        States with national recognition and significant experience and 
        expertise in--
                    (A) public health and biosafety;
                    (B) epidemiology;
                    (C) medicine;
                    (D) emergency management or response;
                    (E) public administration;
                    (F) logistics;
                    (G) organizational management; or
                    (H) medical intelligence and forensic 
                investigations; and
            (5) it is crucial to better understand and manage the 
        increasing likelihood of pandemic threats (such as the recent 
        threats of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola, the 
        2009-H1N1 influenza, and COVID-19) and related health issues 
        that the United States could face during the next several 
        decades.

SEC. 2. COMMISSION ON THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

legislative branch the National Commission on the COVID-19 Pandemic (in

        accounting of--
                    (A) the preparedness of the United States for 
                pandemic disease before the outbreak of COVID-19;

                World Health Organization) in response to COVID-19;
            (2) identify and examine lessons learned regarding pandemic

        of its members. Six members of the Commission shall constitute

        powers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the 
        original appointment was made.
            (4) In-person meetings.--The members of the Commission

            (5) The role of the Federal Government in the development, 
        testing, production, and distribution of treatments and

            (7) The link between variations in the language that 
        individuals use to describe a novel virus or disease and how

        harassment against an identifiable group of people and the 
        communities in which they live.
            (8) The origins of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-
        19. Such an investigation shall include engaging with willing

        genomic sequences, databases, and patient specimens, and 
        personnel of interest. The investigation shall fully and 
        without prejudice explore the likely origins of COVID-19, as 
        addressed in the August, 27, 2020, Office of the Director of 
        National Intelligence unclassified summary of the Intelligence 
        Community assessment on COVID-19 origins, including natural 
        exposure to an infected animal and a laboratory-associated

        sampling by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or another lab 
        conducting similar research.
            (9) Any other subject the Commission determines relevant to 
        understanding the origins of COVID-19, the United States

        for future pandemics.

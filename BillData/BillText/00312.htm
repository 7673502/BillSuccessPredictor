              TEMPORARILY PROVIDING CERTAIN HEALTH OR EMERGENCY 
              SERVICES.

    ``(a) In General.--In the case of an eligible individual, there 
shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle 
for any taxable year an amount equal to the income taxes imposed by a 
service-recipient State on the wages (as defined in section 3401) paid 
to such eligible individual for providing specified health or emergency 
services in such State on a temporary basis during such taxable year.
    ``(b) Eligible Individual.--For purposes of this section, the term 
`eligible individual' means any individual legally domiciled in a State 
who provides specified health or emergency services in another State on 
a temporary basis.
    ``(c) Specified Health or Emergency Services.--For purposes of this 
section, the term `specified health or emergency services' means 
service as a first responder, doctor, nurse, or such other health or 
emergency service as may be specified by the Secretary for purposes of 
this section.
    ``(d) Service-Recipient State.--For purposes of this section, the 
term `service-recipient State' means the State referred to in 
subsection (b) in which the eligible individual provides specified 
health or emergency services on a temporary basis.
    ``(e) Determination of Tax.--The amount of the income tax referred 
to in subsection (a) shall be equal to the excess (if any) of--
            ``(1) the amount of income taxes imposed by the service-
        recipient State on the income of such eligible individual, over
            ``(2) the amount of such income taxes which would be 
        imposed without regard to the wages referred to in subsection 
        (a).
    ``(f) Termination.--Subsection (a) shall not apply with respect to 
wages paid for services which are provided after the date on which the 
Secretary certifies that the COVID-19 emergency has concluded.''.
    (b) Corresponding Reduction in Federal Highway Funds Paid to 
Service-Recipient States.--The amount made available by the Federal 
Government as Federal highway funds to any service-recipient State (as 
defined in section 36C(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall 
be reduced by the aggregate amount of credits (as estimated by the 
Secretary of the Treasury) allowed under section 36C of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to income taxes imposed by such 
State.
    (c) Conforming Amendments.--
            (1) Section 6211(b)(4)(A) of such Code is amended by

    (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to wages paid for services provided after March 16, 2020.

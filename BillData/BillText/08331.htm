                plan or contract amendment--
                            (i) such plan or contract shall not fail to 
                        be treated as being operated in accordance with

                        described in subparagraph (B)(ii) solely 
                        because the plan operates in accordance with

                            (i) In general.--This paragraph shall apply 
                        to any amendment to any plan or annuity 
                        contract which--
                                    (I) is made pursuant to the 
                                amendments made by this section, and

                        apply to any amendment unless during the period 
                        beginning on the effective date of the 
                        amendment and ending on December 31, 2022, the 
                        plan or contract is operated as if such plan or 
                        contract amendment were in effect.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

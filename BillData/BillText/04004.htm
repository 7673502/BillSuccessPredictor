 To prohibit Federal funding for institutions of higher education that 
 have partnerships with schools or other organizations funded by North 
                     Korea, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, 
        also known as Chongryon, is an affiliated organization with the 
        Government of the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, 
        also known as North Korea.
            (2) Chongryon has a long history of assisting the North 
        Korean Government, including operating a ferry that was 
        suspected to have smuggled materials for the country's illegal 
        weapons programs.
            (3) Due to these actions, Chongryon is under surveillance 
        from Japanese law enforcement agencies.
            (4) Chongryon and its members run numerous organizations 
        and companies, including banks and educational institutions in 
        various cities across Japan.
            (5) Chongryon operates over 100 educational institutions, 
        including Korea University, located in Kodaira, Tokyo.
            (6) Korea University received funding directly from the 
        North Korean government every year since 1957, including over 
        132.4 million yen in 2002.

end the following new subsection:
    ``(h)(1) No covered funds may be awarded to an institution of

    ``(2) In this subsection:
            ``(A) The term `covered funds' means Federal funds made 
        available--
                    ``(i) under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 
                1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq.); and
                    ``(ii) for the J. William Fulbright Educational

            ``(B) The term `institution of higher education' has the 
        meaning given that term in section 102 of the Higher Education 
        Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002).''.

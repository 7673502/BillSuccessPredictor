            (1) According to Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 
        February 2020, unemployment was at 3.5 percent.
            (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, during March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020, States and 
        territories issued mandatory stay-at-home orders due to the 
        spread of COVID-19 in the United States.
            (3) According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, in 
        April 2020, unemployment was 14.7 percent with 23.1 million 
        people unemployed.
            (4) In a December 2020 Chamber of Commerce report, 50 
        percent of small business owners reported they saw their

                                 A BILL


 
   To amend the America COMPETES Act to establish certain scientific 
integrity policies for Federal agencies that fund, conduct, or oversee 
              scientific research, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Scientific Integrity Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) science and the scientific process should help inform 
        and guide public policy decisions on a wide range of issues, 
        including improvement of public health, protection of the 
        environment, and protection of national security;
            (2) the public must be able to trust the science and 
        scientific process informing public policy decisions;
            (3) science, the scientific process, and the communication 
        of science should be free from politics, ideology, and 
        financial conflicts of interest;
            (4) policies and procedures that ensure the integrity of 
        the conduct and communication of publicly funded science are 
        critical to ensuring public trust;
            (5) a Federal agency that funds, conducts, or oversees 
        research should not suppress, alter, interfere with, or 
        otherwise impede the timely communication and open exchange of 
        data and findings to other agencies, policymakers, and the 
        public of research conducted by a scientist or engineer 
        employed or contracted by a Federal agency that funds, 
        conducts, or oversees scientific research;
            (6) Federal agencies that fund, conduct, or oversee 
        research should work to prevent the suppression or distortion 
        of the data and findings;
            (7) under the First Amendment to the Constitution, citizens 
        of the United States have the right to ``petition the 
        government for a redress of grievances''; and
            (8) Congress has further protected those rights under 
        section 7211 of title 5, United States Code, which states, 
        ``the right of employees, individually or collectively, to 
        petition Congress or a member of Congress . . . may not be 
        interfered with or denied''.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO AMERICA COMPETES ACT.

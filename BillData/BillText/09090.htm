   To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to treat certain 
   multimarker testing relating to ovarian cancer as reasonable and 
           necessary for coverage under the Medicare program.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Diane Powis Ovarian Cancer Testing 
Access Act''.

SEC. 2. CERTAIN MULTIMARKER TESTING RELATED TO OVARIAN CANCER DEEMED 
              REASONABLE AND NECESSARY FOR MEDICARE COVERAGE.

    Section 1834 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395m) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(z) Certain Multimarker Testing Related to Ovarian Cancer Deemed 
Reasonable and Necessary.--
            ``(1) In general.--In the case of a clinical diagnostic 
        laboratory test that is a multimarker test related to ovarian 
        cancer that is furnished on or after January 1, 2023, to an 
        individual who has been diagnosed with an ovarian adnexal mass, 
        such test shall be deemed reasonable and necessary for purposes 
        of section 1862(a)(1)(A) if the physician who orders such test 
        determines such test is necessary for such individual and 
        prescribes, dispenses, or administers such test for use in 
        accordance with the labeling approved for such test by the Food 
        and Drug Administration.
            ``(2) Multimarker test related to ovarian cancer defined.--
        For purposes of this subsection, the term `multimarker test 
        related to ovarian cancer' means a test that evaluates more 
        than one tumor marker with respect to ovarian cancer.''.

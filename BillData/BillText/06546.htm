_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To direct the Secretary of Transportation to establish a Wireless 
    Electric Vehicle Charging Grant Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging 
Grant Program Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Electric vehicles are crucial to cutting greenhouse gas 
        emissions, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and combating the 
        climate crisis. As of 2019, the transportation sector accounts 
        for 29 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is the 
        most of any sector.
            (2) Increasing the adoption of electric vehicles will 
        reduce pollution and increase air quality for communities 
        located near roads with high traffic density or high-volume 
        routes.
            (3) As the automotive industry shifts towards electric 
        vehicles, investing in new electric vehicle technologies will 
        be crucial to enhancing America's competitiveness, creating 
        jobs, and ensuring continued economic growth.
            (4) Range anxiety is one of the chief barriers to electric 
        vehicle adoption. If deployed strategically, wireless electric 
        vehicle charging could help by providing drivers convenient 
        opportunities to charge and extend the range of electric 
        vehicles.
            (5) Wireless charging technologies could be invaluable for 
        electric transit buses, trucking, fleet vehicles, and 
        autonomous electric vehicles, allowing for convenient and 
        hands-free charging, while also lowering costs, as effective 
        wireless charging would reduce the need for larger and heavier 
        batteries.
            (6) Wireless electric vehicle charging has the potential to 
        make electric vehicles more accessible and allow all people of 
        the United States, regardless of physical ability, to enjoy the 
        benefits of electric vehicles.
            (7) It is critical to establish a resilient and robust 
        domestic supply chain for all electric vehicle charging 
        infrastructure. With strong Buy America requirements, federally 
        funded programs can incentivize companies to build facilities 
        in the United States, creating good paying jobs and economic 
        growth for communities.

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF WIRELESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING GRANT 
              PROGRAM.

    The Secretary of Transportation shall establish a program, in 
coordination with the Department of Energy, to award grants on a 
competitive basis to eligible entities for projects to construct, 
install, or improve existing wireless charging infrastructure and 
technology for electric vehicles. The program shall be known as the 
Wireless Electric Vehicle Charging Grant Program (in this Act referred 
to as the ``Program'').

SEC. 4. DUTIES OF SECRETARY.

    In carrying out the Program, the Secretary--
            (1) may award grants for projects described in section 3, 
        including for wireless charging located along roads, in parking 
        lots, airports, and at coastal and inland ports;
            (2) shall ensure that recipients of the grants focus on the 
        wireless charging of 1 or more of--
                    (A) light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles;
                    (B) fleet vehicles, including the Federal vehicle 
                fleets; and
                    (C) public transit;
            (3) shall publish an annual progress report to the relevant 
        committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate that

                disbursed, and reasons for the selection of projects;
                    (B) the progress of each pilot project funded under 
                the Program;
                    (C) successes, failures, and safety of the 
                technologies funded under the Program;
                    (D) recommendations for future funding, best 
                practices, and policies relating to wireless electric 
                vehicle charging;
                    (E) workforce impacts of each project;
                    (F) the environmental impact of each project, such 
                as the amount of fuel saved from the project, predicted 
                emissions savings, changes in air quality, and any 
                other environmental information deemed necessary by the 
                Secretary; and
                    (G) any other information the Secretary considers 
                necessary; and
            (4) may provide technical assistance, as determined

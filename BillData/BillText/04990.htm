                                 AN ACT


 
 To codify the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences and to direct 
the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information 
  to establish an initiative to support the development of emergency 
    communication and tracking technologies, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Institute for Telecommunication 
Sciences Codification Act'' or the ``ITS Codification Act''.

SEC. 2. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SCIENCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The test center within National Telecommunications and 
        Information Administration (in this subsection referred to as 
        the ``NTIA'') represents executive branch agencies on spectrum 
        issues before the Federal Communications Commission.
            (2) Understanding radio frequency propagation 
        characteristics and modeling is a critical component of making 
        spectrum decisions.
            (3) Federal agencies rely on expert engineering studies, 
        simulations, and analyses to make determinations about how to 
        make spectrum available for commercial use, including through 
        system relocations and identifying spectrum sharing 
        opportunities through the NTIA.
            (4) Clearing of Federal spectrum, when feasible, is the 
        priority action to take to make Federal spectrum available for 
        commercial uses as required by section 113(j)(1) of the 
        National Telecommunications and Information Administration 
        Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(j)(1)).
            (5) Sharing of Federal spectrum between Federal entities 
        and commercial entities provides access to Federal spectrum for 
        commercial uses in circumstances where clearing is not 
        feasible.
            (6) The test center within NTIA, is the Government's 
        premier expert laboratory for spectrum research activities, 
        spectrum sharing innovation and testing, spectrum interference 
        studies, and all activities related to advancing next 
        generation wireless technologies.
            (7) The test center within NTIA is critical for undertaking 
        engineering studies and analyses that inform clearing or 
        sharing opportunities and facilitate policy decisions to 
        maximize the efficient use of spectrum resources.
    (b) Operation of Test Center.--Part A of the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act (47 
U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 106. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SCIENCES.

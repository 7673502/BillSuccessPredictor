    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

from Illegal Immigration Act''.

SEC. 2. LIMITATION ON LEGAL SETTLEMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO UNLAWFULLY 
              ENTERED THE UNITED STATES.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funds, 
including amounts deposited into the Judgment Fund established under

legal settlement to any individual who violated section 275(a) of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1325(a)) if the claims giving 
rise to such settlement are based solely on the lawful detention of 
such individual as part of a family unit after entry at a port of entry 
or between ports of entry along the southern border of the United 
States after January 20, 2017.

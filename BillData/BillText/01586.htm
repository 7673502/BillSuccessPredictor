        balance of principal and interest due on the loan.
            ``(6) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection 
        shall be construed to limit the remedies available under this

cosigned by an institution participating in the program under this 
section shall be a rate determined by the Secretary that is--

        under section 455(b); and
            ``(2) reduced below such standard rate by a percentage that

              CONTRACEPTION.

    (a) Preemption.--No State shall establish, implement, or enforce 
any ban on the prescription, provision, or use of a drug, biological 
product, or device for contraception if such drug, biological product, 
or device is approved, licensed, cleared, or otherwise authorized for 
human use by the Food and Drug Administration for contraception.
    (b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall be 
construed--
            (1) to infringe the ability of a State to regulate the 
        practice of medicine and pharmacy within such State;
            (2) to preempt the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 
        1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.); or
            (3) to preempt any State law to the extent such State law 
        protects the right of any entity to opt out of providing 
        contraception if such provision would be contrary to that 
        entity's religious or moral beliefs.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``biological product'' has the meaning given 
        such term in section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To establish a pilot program to address technology-related abuse in 
                        domestic violence cases.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tech Safety for Victims of Domestic 
Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States, 27 percent of women and 11 
        percent of men experience some form of physical violence or 
        stalking by an intimate partner.
            (2) Many victims of intimate partner violence also 
        experience nonphysical forms of abuse.
            (3) With the proliferation of digital technology, 
        technological abuse has become increasingly prevalent and 
        pervasive among victims of intimate partner violence.
            (4) According to a 2021 study by the National Network to 
        End Domestic Violence, 97 percent of the programs providing 
        support to victims of intimate partner violence have indicated 
        that abusers are making use of technology to stalk, harass, or 
        control victims.
            (5) In the United States, 1 in 3 women under the age of 35 
        report being sexually harassed online, and over half of 
        lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals report being the target 
        of online abuse based on their sexual orientation or gender.
            (6) Of victims who are stalked using technology--
                    (A) 67 percent received unwanted phone calls, voice 
                messages, or text messages;
                    (B) 50 percent received unwanted emails or messages 
                via the internet;
                    (C) about 35 percent said their activities were 
                monitored using social media;
                    (D) 27 percent experienced the offender posting or 
                threatening to post inappropriate, unwanted, or 
                personal information about them on the internet; and
                    (E) 19 percent said the offender spied on them or 
                monitored their activities using technologies such as 
                listening devices, cameras, or computer or cellphone 
                monitoring software.
            (7) Technological abuse runs the gamut of technical 
        sophistication, from the most basic social media platforms and 
        phone-based apps to specialty stalkerware apps, demonstrating 
        that technological abuse does not require huge financial 
        resources or complex knowledge of technology.
            (8) Rapid advances in the technology and methods for 
        technological abuse present challenges for advocates seeking to 
        advise victims and prevent technological abuse.
            (9) The integration of trained technology experts into 
        survivor support networks has been successful in preventing and 
        shielding survivors from technological abuse.

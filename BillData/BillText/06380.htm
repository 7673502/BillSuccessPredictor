                                 A BILL


 
 To direct the Secretary of Education to establish a grant program to 
 make grants to the parents of students enrolled in elementary schools 
  or secondary schools that, for any reason related to COVID-19, are 
failing to provide in-person instruction for each enrolled student for 
   each school day of school year 2021-2022, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Open Schools Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Parents are best equipped to make decisions for their 
        children, including the educational setting that will best 
        serve the interests and educational needs of their child.
            (2) After more than 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is 
        now known that pandemic-related school closures deprive 
        children of the equalizing force of education. The pandemic is 
        widening educational inequality and the learning gaps created 
        by these shutdowns will only get even worse if they continue.
            (3) Peer interactions are a crucial ingredient to academic 
        success. A Yale University study has found that the inability 
        to be with friends and peers from different socioeconomic 
        groups did more damage to children's educational progress than 
        any other factor and underscored the importance of having kids 
        from across the socioeconomic spectrum learning together.
            (4) When schools close, parents are often asked to 
        facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to 
        perform this task. This is especially true for parents with 
        limited resources which can be exacerbated even more for rural 
        families without access to broadband.
            (5) Despite what the mainstream media says about most 
        parents across America working from home, that simply is not 
        the case. In fact, the vast majority of parents do not have the 
        work from home luxury many so-called experts would have you 
        believe. This has further divided the United States between 
        regular, hard-working parents and a new ``laptop class'' that 
        only works remotely. These working-class parents do not have 
        the ability to help their children learn when their school 
        switches to remote learning, even if only for a few days at a 
        time.
            (6) Crucial benchmarks like achievement tests and high 
        stakes examinations that determine admission or advancement to 
        new education levels and institutions, are thrown into disarray 
        when schools close. Strategies to postpone, skip, or administer 
        examinations at a distance raise serious concerns about 
        fairness, especially when access to learning becomes variable. 
        Disruptions to assessments results in stress for students and 
        their families and often trigger disengagement.
            (7) Youth may be uniquely susceptible to negative mental 
        health outcomes if they are experiencing pandemic-related 
        disruptions to in-person schooling in intersection with other 
        adverse circumstances, such as racism, poverty, food 
        insecurity, or home instability. Loss of access to school-based 
        mental health care may be of heightened importance for youth 
        from low-income families, as they are most likely to receive 
        mental health services solely from their school.
            (8) Online learning is no substitute for classroom 
        instruction. Nationally, on average, teachers say they're 
        working 2 fewer hours per day than when they were in their 
        classrooms. And they estimate that their students are spending 
        half as much time learning, 3 hours a day, as they were before 
        the coronavirus pandemic.
            (9) Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago public schools 
        leadership insist schools are safe and have called the refusal 
        of the Chicago Teachers Union to work in-person a strike and an 
        illegal work action. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has 
        confirmed schools are safe for students, including in Chicago. 
        More than 300,000 public school students in Chicago were off in 
        January after the district canceled classes when the Chicago 
        Teachers Union voted to refuse orders to work in-person. ``Our 
        schools are safe'', Chicago public schools CEO Pedro Martinez 
        said during a press conference on January 4, 2022, after the 
        results of the vote were announced. ``There is no evidence that 
        our schools have ever been unsafe this school year.''. He added 
        that Chicago schools rarely saw evidence of any major 
        transmission.
            (10) Instead of pouring money into schools that are failing 
        to stay open for full, in-person learning, the United States 
        must instead use these taxpayer dollars to support children, 
        not the teacher's unions, and allow parents to make decisions 
        about their child's educational future. The United States 
        should provide eligible parents the ability to elect to educate 
        their child in an alternate manner, apart from their local 
        public school that has closed for in-person learning.

SEC. 3. GRANT PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education shall establish a grant 
program to make grants to parents of eligible students for the purposes

        related to COVID-19, the covered school in which such student 
        is enrolled for school year 2021-2022 is failing to provide in-
        person learning for each enrolled student for each school day 
        during such school year.
            (2) Other requirements.--The Secretary shall accept

                section 2001 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 
                (20 U.S.C. 3401 note) to the local educational agency 
                in which the applicable covered school is located to

            (2) to pay the cost (such as the average per pupil price) 
        of attending a public elementary school or secondary school 
        that provides in-person school;

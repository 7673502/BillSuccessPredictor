                            ``(ii) Recertification.--A court may grant 
                        an extension under subparagraph (A) if the

                        States remains engaged in good faith

                        whom a stay of claims is sought. In choosing 
                        whether to grant an extension, the court shall 
                        balance the interests of the United States with 
                        the interests of the plaintiffs in a timely 
                        review of their claims.
    ``(g) Enforcement by State Attorneys General.--Any State, on its 
own behalf or on behalf of the citizens or residents of the State, may

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend title 18, United States Code, to protect pain-capable unborn 
                   children, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Pain-Capable Unborn 
Children from Late-Term Abortions Act''.

SEC. 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL 
              AUTHORITY FOR ENACTMENT.

    Congress finds and declares the following:
            (1) Medical and other authorities now know more about human 
        prenatal development than ever before including that--
                    (A) an unborn child begins to move about in the 
                womb and reacts to touch at approximately 8 weeks 
                gestation;
                    (B) the eyes begin to form at 5 weeks gestation and 
                finish forming by 10 weeks gestation; eye movements can 
                be detected by ultrasound at 12 weeks gestation;
                    (C) by 8 to 9 weeks gestation, the unborn child has 
                detectable brain waves;
                    (D) at 9 weeks gestation, an unborn child's 
                diaphragm is developing, and he or she may even hiccup, 
                and he or she is beginning to move about freely in the 
                womb;
                    (E) at 9 to 11 weeks gestation, teeth as well as 
                external genitalia begin to form;
                    (F) by 10 weeks gestation all of an unborn child's 
                organ rudiments are formed and in place, the digestive 
                system and kidneys start to function at this time, and 
                the unborn child will show a preference for either 
                right handedness or left handedness;
                    (G) at 12 weeks gestation, an unborn child can open 
                and close his or her fingers, starts to make sucking 
                motions, senses stimulation from the world outside the 
                womb, and fingernails and fingerprints begin to form; 
                and
                    (H) the Supreme Court has acknowledged that, by at 
                least 12 weeks gestation, an unborn child has taken on 
                ``the human form'' in all relevant aspects (Gonzales v. 
                Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 160 (2007)).
            (2) Pain receptors (nociceptors) begin forming at 7 weeks 
        gestational age. Nerves linking these pain receptors to the 
        brain's thalamus and subcortical plate form between 12 and 20 
        weeks gestational age. It is no later than 16 weeks gestational 
        age that the first contact occurs between the subcortical plate 
        and these forming fibers.
            (3) In considering the use of anesthesia for invasive 
        medical procedures performed on the fetus, evidence has 
        concluded that from as early as 12 weeks, and certainly by 15 
        weeks gestational age onward, the fetus is extremely sensitive 
        to painful stimuli, making it necessary to apply adequate 
        analgesia and anesthesia to prevent fetal suffering.
            (4) Substantial evidence indicates that neural elements, 
        such as the thalamus and subcortical plate, develop at specific 
        times during the early development of an unborn child, serve as 
        pain-processing structures, and are different from the neural 
        elements used for pain processing by adults. Recent evidence, 
        particularly since 2016, demonstrates that structures 
        responsible for pain show signs of sufficient maturation from 
        15 weeks of gestation and thereafter.
            (5) In the unborn child, application of such painful 
        stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress 
        hormones known as the stress response.
            (6) Subjection to such painful stimuli is associated with 
        long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered 
        pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and 
        learning disabilities later in life.
            (7) For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal 
        anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a 
        decrease in stress hormones compared to their level when 
        painful stimuli are applied without such anesthesia.
            (8) The assertion by some medical experts that the unborn 
        child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point in 
        pregnancy later than 24 weeks gestational age predominately 
        rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain 
        depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections 
        between the thalamus and the cortex. However, recent medical 
        research and analysis, especially since 2007, provides strong 
        evidence for the conclusion that a functioning cortex is not 
        necessary to experience pain.
            (9) Substantial evidence indicates that children born 
        missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, such as those with 
        hydranencephaly, nevertheless experience pain.
            (10) In adult humans and in animals, stimulation or 
        ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, 
        while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does.
            (11) The assertion of some medical experts that the unborn 
        child remains in a coma-like sleep state that precludes the 
        unborn child from experiencing pain is inconsistent with the 
        documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and 
        with the experience of fetal surgeons who have found it 
        necessary to sedate an unborn child with anesthesia and provide 
        analgesia to prevent the unborn child from engaging in vigorous 
        movement in reaction to invasive surgery.
            (12) Consequently, there is substantial medical evidence 
        that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain at least 
        by 15 weeks gestational age, if not earlier.
            (13) Abortion carries significant physical and 
        psychological risks to the pregnant woman, and these physical 
        and psychological risks increase with gestational age.
            (14) The majority of abortion procedures performed after 15 
        weeks gestation are dismemberment abortion procedures which 
        involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the 
        unborn child apart before removing the pieces of the dead child 
        from the womb.
            (15) Medical complications from dismemberment abortions 
        include, but are not limited to, pelvic infection; incomplete 
        abortions (retained tissue); blood clots; heavy bleeding or 
        hemorrhage; laceration, tear, or other injury to the cervix; 
        puncture, laceration, tear, or other injury to the uterus; 
        injury to the bowel or bladder; depression; anxiety; substance 
        abuse; and other emotional or psychological problems. Further, 
        in abortions performed after 15 weeks gestation, there is a 
        higher risk of requiring a hysterectomy, other reparative 
        surgery, or blood transfusion.
            (16) Subparagraphs (J) and (K) of section 2(14) of the 
        Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-105; 117 
        Stat. 1202) find that a late-term abortion, such as a 
        dismemberment abortion, ``confuses the medical, legal, and 
        ethical duties of physicians to preserve and promote life, as 
        the physician acts directly against the physical life of a 
        child'' and ``undermines the public's perception of the 
        appropriate role of a physician''.
            (17) ``The [United States Supreme] Court has given state 
        and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in 
        areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty'' that 
        ``the law need not give abortion doctors unfettered choice in 
        the course of their medical practice, nor should it elevate 
        their status above other physicians in the medical community,'' 
        and that ``medical uncertainty does not foreclose the exercise 
        of legislative power in the abortion context any more than it 
        does in other contexts,'' (Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. at 
        124).
            (18) The Supreme Court has held that ``It is time to heed 
        the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the 
        people's elected representatives''. (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's 
        Health Organization, 142 S. Ct. 2228, 2243 (2022)).
            (19) It is the purpose of the Congress to assert a 
        compelling governmental interest in protecting the lives of 
        unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical 
        evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain.
            (20) The Supreme Court has also held that ``a law 
        regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is 
        entitled to a `strong presumption of validity.' . . . It must 
        be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the 
        legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate 
        state interests. . . . These legitimate interests include 
        respect for and preservation of prenatal life at all stages of 
        development . . . ; the protection of maternal health and 
        safety; the elimination of particularly gruesome or barbaric 
        medical procedures; the preservation of the integrity of the 
        medical profession; the mitigation of fetal pain; and the 
        prevention of discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or 
        disability.'' (Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, 
        142 S. Ct. at 2239).
            (21) Congress has authority to extend protection to pain-
        capable unborn children under the Supreme Court's Commerce 
        Clause precedents and under the Constitution's grants of powers 
        to Congress under the Equal Protection, Due Process, and 
        Enforcement Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.

SEC. 3. PAIN-CAPABLE UNBORN CHILD PROTECTION.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 74 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by inserting after section 1531 the following:
``Sec. 1532. Pain-capable unborn child protection

        or reasonably rely upon such a determination made by another 
        physician. In making such a determination, the physician shall 
        make such inquiries of the pregnant woman and perform or cause 
        to be performed such medical examinations and tests as a 
        reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and 
        the medical conditions involved, would consider necessary to 
        make an accurate determination of gestational age.
            ``(2) Prohibition on performance of certain abortions.--

                so only in the manner which, in reasonable medical

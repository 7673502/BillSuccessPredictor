                                 A BILL


 
To reinforce commercial relationships with Latin American and Caribbean 
       allies and expand critical supply chains in the Americas.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Opportunities in the Americas Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere play a vital 
        role in ensuring regional peace, security, and democracy.
            (2) According to the United States Trade Representative, in 
        2020 the United States exported $11.1 billion worth of goods to 
        Caribbean Basin Initiative countries and imported $5.1 billion.
            (3) According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2021 
        the United States exported $174.62 billion worth of goods to 
        Central and South America and imported $120.99 billion.
            (4) The economic viability of the Western Hemisphere brings 
        essential strength and stability to the region.
            (5) There is significant opportunity to improve regional 
        investment in manufacturing, co-production and nearshoring 
        arrangements, and the free flow of goods and services in the 
        Western Hemisphere.
            (6) Closer economic integration among the Americas through 
        free trade agreements encourages further economic and 
        commercial ties in the region.
            (7) The United States should exercise its influence to 
        encourage private sector investment, free markets, and economic 
        cooperation in the region.
            (8) Countries in the Western Hemisphere should combat 
        corruption, strengthen their judicial systems, reduce 
        bureaucratic red tape, streamline permitting, and embrace free 
        markets in order to encourage more private sector investment.
            (9) The Western Hemisphere has a supply chain that is 
        overly dependent on the People's Republic of China.
            (10) The United States free trade agreements and preference 
        programs in the Western Hemisphere, including the Dominican 
        Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement and the Caribbean 
        Basin Trade Partnership Act, are key economic drivers in the 
        region and represent a crucial alternative co-production and 
        trading bloc to the People's Republic of China.
            (11) Ensuring that critical supply chains for key products, 
        including textiles and apparel, lithium batteries, and 
        pharmaceuticals, are located both in the United States and 
        other countries in the Western Hemisphere is a national 
        security priority for the United States.
            (12) The United States should enact policies that 
        incentivize manufacturers to relocate to the Western 
        Hemisphere, and United States companies to expand operations in 
        the region through nearshoring and co-production arrangements.
            (13) Increased investment incentives, co-production, and 
        trade between the United States and Latin America and the 
        Caribbean will foster joint economic and commercial growth, 
        increase investment opportunities, and contribute to job 
        creation.

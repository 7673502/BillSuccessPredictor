To protect children and other consumers against hazards associated with 
 the accidental ingestion of button cell or coin batteries by requiring 
the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a consumer product 
safety standard to require child-resistant closures on consumer products 
            that use such batteries, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as ``Reese's Law''.
SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD FOR BUTTON CELL OR COIN 
BATTERIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS CONTAINING SUCH BATTERIES.
    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall, in accordance with section 
553 of title 5, United States Code, promulgate a final consumer product 
safety standard for button cell or coin batteries and consumer products 
containing button cell or coin batteries that shall only contain--
        (1) a performance standard requiring the button cell or coin 
    battery compartments of a consumer product containing button cell 
    or coin batteries to be secured in a manner that would eliminate or 
    adequately reduce the risk of injury from button or coin cell 
    battery ingestion by children that are 6 years of age or younger 
    during reasonably foreseeable use or misuse conditions; and
        (2) warning label requirements--
            (A) to be included on the packaging of button cell or coin 
        batteries and the packaging of a consumer product containing 
        button cell or coin batteries;
            (B) to be included in any literature, such as a user 
        manual, that accompanies a consumer product containing button 
        cell or coin batteries; and
            (C) to be included, as practicable--
                (i) directly on a consumer product containing button 
            cell or coin batteries in a manner that is visible to the 
            consumer upon installation or replacement of the button 
            cell or coin battery; or
                (ii) in the case of a product for which the battery is 
            not intended to be replaced or installed by the consumer, 
            to be included directly on the consumer product in a manner 
            that is visible to the consumer upon access to the battery 
            compartment, except that if it is impracticable to label 
            the product, this information shall be placed on the 
            packaging or instructions.
    (b) Requirements for Warning Labels.--Warning labels required under 
subsection (a)(2) shall--
        (1) clearly identify the hazard of ingestion; and
        (2) instruct consumers, as practicable, to keep new and used 
    batteries out of the reach of children, to seek immediate medical 
    attention if a battery is ingested, and to follow any other 
    consensus medical advice.
    (c) Treatment of Standard for Enforcement Purposes.--A consumer 
product safety standard promulgated under subsection (a) shall be 
treated as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 
of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).
    (d) Exception for Reliance on Voluntary Standard.--
        (1) Before promulgation of standard by commission.--Subsection 
    (a) shall not apply if the Commission determines, before the 
    Commission promulgates a final consumer product safety standard 
    under such subsection, that--
            (A) with respect to any consumer product for which there is 
        a voluntary consumer product safety standard that meets the 
        requirements for a standard promulgated under subsection (a) 
        with respect to such product; and
            (B) the voluntary standard described in subparagraph (A)--
                (i) is in effect at the time of the determination by 
            the Commission; or
                (ii) will be in effect not later than the date that is 
            180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.
        (2) Determination required to be published in federal 
    register.--Any determination made by the Commission under this 
    subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.
    (e) Treatment of Voluntary Standard for Enforcement Purposes.--
        (1) In general.--If the Commission makes a determination under 
    subsection (d) with respect to a voluntary standard, the 
    requirements of such voluntary standard shall be treated as a 
    consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the 
    Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning on the date 
    described in paragraph (2).
        (2) Date described.--The date described in this paragraph is 
    the later of--
            (A) the date of the determination of the Commission under 
        subsection (d) with respect to the voluntary standard described 
        in paragraph (1); or
            (B) the effective date contained in the voluntary standard 
        described in paragraph (1).
    (f) Revision of Voluntary Standard.--
        (1) Notice to commission.--If a voluntary standard with respect 
    to which the Commission has made a determination under subsection 
    (d) is subsequently revised, the organization that revised the 
    standard shall notify the Commission after the final approval of 
    the revision.
        (2) Effective date of revision.--Beginning on the date that is 
    180 days after the Commission is notified of a revised voluntary 
    standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later date as the 
    Commission determines appropriate), such revised voluntary standard 
    in whole or in part shall be considered to be a consumer product 
    safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product 
    Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), in place of the prior version, unless, 
    within 90 days after receiving the notice, the Commission notifies 
    the organization that the revised voluntary standard, in whole or 
    in part, does not improve the safety of the consumer product 
    covered by the standard and that the Commission is retaining all or 
    part of the existing consumer product safety standard.
    (g) Future Rulemaking.--At any time after the promulgation of a 
final consumer product safety standard under subsection (a), a 
voluntary standard is treated as a consumer product safety rule under 
subsection (e), or a revised voluntary standard becomes enforceable as 
a consumer product safety rule under subsection (f), the Commission may 
initiate a rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United 
States Code, to modify the requirements of the standard or revised 
standard. Any rule promulgated under this subsection shall be treated 
as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9 of the 
Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).
SEC. 3. CHILD-RESISTANT PACKAGING FOR BUTTON CELL OR COIN BATTERIES.
    (a) Requirement.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, any button cell or coin battery sold, offered 
for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce, or imported 
into the United States, or included separately with a consumer product 
sold, offered for sale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce, 
or imported into the United States, shall be packaged in accordance 
with the standards provided in section 1700.15 of title 16, Code of 
Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation), as determined 
through testing in accordance with the method described in section 
1700.20 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations (or any successor 
regulation), or another test method for button cell or coin battery 
packaging specified, by rule, by the Commission.
    (b) Applicability.--The requirement of subsection (a) shall be 
treated as a standard for the special packaging of a household 
substance established under section 3(a) of the Poison Prevention 
Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1472(a)).
SEC. 4. EXEMPTION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING STANDARD.
    The standards promulgated under this Act shall not apply with 
respect to any toy product that is in compliance with the battery 
accessibility and labeling requirements of part 1250 of title 16, Code 
of Federal Regulations, and in reference to section 3(a), shall not 
apply with respect to button cell or coin batteries that are in

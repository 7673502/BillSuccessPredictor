        such paragraph) and the plan of such coverage in which the 
        individual is enrolled.''.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    In the case of a State plan for medical assistance under title XIX 
of the Social Security Act that the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services determines requires State legislation (other than legislation 
appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the additional 
requirement imposed by the amendments made under this section, the 
State plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply with the 
requirements of such title solely on the basis of its failure to meet 
this additional requirement before the first day of the first calendar 
quarter beginning after the close of the first regular session of the 
State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment of this 
Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case of a State that 
has a 2-year legislative session, each year of such session shall be 
deemed to be a separate regular session of the State legislature.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

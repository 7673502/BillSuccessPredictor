        for Federal wildland firefighters and their immediate family;
            (4) expanding the Critical Incident Stress Management 
        Program through training, developing, and retaining a larger 
        pool of qualified mental health professionals who are familiar 
        with the experiences of the wildland firefighting workforce, 
        and monitoring and tracking mental health in the profession to 
        better understand the scope of the issue and develop strategies 
        to assist; and
            (5) establish and carry out a new and distinct mental 
        health support service specific to Federal wildland 
        firefighters and their immediate family, with culturally 
        relevant and trauma-informed mental health professionals who 
        are readily available and not subject to any limit on the 
        number of sessions or service provided.
    (b) Mental Health Leave.--Each Federal wildland firefighter shall 
be entitled to 7 consecutive days of leave, without loss or reduction 
in pay, during each calendar year for the purposes of maintaining 
mental health. Such leave may only be taken during the period beginning 
on June 1 and ending on October 31 of any such year. If leave is not 
taken under this section it expires after October 31 of the calendar 
year.
    (c) Federal Wildland Firefighter Defined.--In this Act, the term 
``Federal wildland firefighter'' means any temporary, seasonal, or 
permanent position at the Department of Agriculture or the Department 
of Interior that maintains group, emergency incident management, or

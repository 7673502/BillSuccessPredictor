        such action may require interveners taking similar positions to 
        file joint papers or to be represented by a single attorney at 
        oral argument, provided that the court does not require such 
        interveners to join any brief filed on behalf of any State 
        which is a defendant in such action.
    (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section, the terms 
``eligible student'', ``scholarship granting organization'', and

same meanings given such terms under section 25E(c) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by section 2(a) of this Act).

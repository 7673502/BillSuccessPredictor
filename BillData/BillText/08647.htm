SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting All Communities Equally 
Act of 2022'' or as the ``PACE Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT OF AVAILABILITY OF CASH BAIL FOR CERTAIN OFFENDERS.

    If monetary bail has been prohibited in a State or any political 
subdivision thereof, the courts of that State shall have the 
authority--

        the courts on criminal charges; and
            (2) to hold on bail individuals who are determined to be 
        violent and/or repeat offenders.

SEC. 3. WAIVER OF SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY.

    A State or political subdivision thereof that has a prohibition on 
monetary bail waives sovereign immunity with respect to a cause of 
action against the local government by an individual for property 
damages or damages for personal injuries as a result of a dangerous 
criminal being released without monetary bail.

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

    This Act shall take effect beginning on the date that is 30 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

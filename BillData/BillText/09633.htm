                                 A BILL


 
To authorize Arizona Tribes to enter into lease or exchange agreements 
and storage agreements relating to their decreed water entitlements as 
      a long-term source of water supply, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Arizona Tribes Water Marketing Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The entire American West and Southwest are facing 
        forecasts of prolonged droughts that will leave States and 
        Tribes facing major water shortages.
            (2) Recent periods of drought in the American West have 
        also occurred with higher temperatures and reduced snowpack and 
        led to what climate scientists recently concluded was possibly 
        the most severe drought in over 1,200 years.
            (3) The Colorado River has been under drought conditions 
        since 2000, most recently denoted as the most endangered river 
        in the United States, and the State of Arizona is in a ``mega-
        drought'' according to climate scientists.
            (4) The Secretary manages the lower Colorado River system 
        in accordance with Federal law including--
                    (A) the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928;
                    (B) the 1963 Decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 
                Arizona v. California;
                    (C) the 2006 Consolidated Decree of the U.S. 
                Supreme Court in Arizona v. California;
                    (D) the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968;
                    (E) the Criteria for Coordinated Long-Range 
                Operation of Colorado River Reservoirs Pursuant to the 
                Colorado River Basin Project Act of September 30, 1968;
                    (F) the Grand Canyon Protection Act of 1992;
                    (G) the 2007 Interim Guidelines; and
                    (H) other applicable provisions of Federal law.
            (5) The 2007 Interim Guidelines will expire in 2026. The 7 
        States that are within the Colorado River basin are re-
        negotiating these guidelines with the Federal Government to 
        take account of current forecasts of available supply from the 
        Colorado River, which is dramatically reduced from what it had 
        been when the guidelines were adopted in 2007.
            (6) Colorado River water that had been stored in Lake 
        Powell and Lake Mead has been gradually used up as the drought 
        has continued. Conservation of water supplies is for the 
        foreseeable future the only viable way to address water 
        shortage and water supplies from the Colorado River.
            (7) While conservation is the current focus to address the 
        ``mega-drought'' in the State of Arizona, additional efforts 
        should be made now to identify future long-term water supplies 
        to offset the reduced supplies available from the Colorado 
        River and other natural rivers and streams flowing in the 
        State.
            (8) Congress recognizes that there are 22 Tribes in the 
        State of Arizona. Of those Tribes, some have judicially decreed 
        water entitlements decreed to them through various State and 
        Federal court decrees. Other Arizona Tribes have claims pending 
        for additional water entitlements, many of which will also 
        result in judicially decreed Tribal entitlements. These 
        judicially decreed Tribal entitlements to water are currently 
        not available as a potential water supply to offset the reduced 
        supplies available from the Colorado River and other natural 
        rivers and streams flowing in the State.
            (9) Congress further recognizes that Arizona Tribes that 
        hold judicially decreed rights to water from the Colorado River 
        or other rivers and streams flowing in Arizona should be able 
        to enter into lease or exchange agreements and storage 
        agreements to make such decreed entitlements potentially 
        available to other water users in the State as part of a long-
        term alternative supply.
            (10) Making such judicially decreed Tribal water supplies 
        available as a long-term water supply should be considered and 
        implemented as part of a long-term strategy for addressing the 
        mega-drought in the Southwest, and should be considered as part 
        of the ongoing basin State re-negotiation of the 2007 Interim 
        Guidelines.
            (11) In the meantime, to address the current crisis, all 
        parties with excess supplies of water should consider ways of 
        conserving those supplies through existing Federal and State 
        programs that provide for the conservation of such supplies for 
        the benefit of both Lake Mead and Lake Powell.

SEC. 3. PURPOSES.

    The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to authorize Arizona Tribes to enter into Lease or

        being and for the benefit of their surrounding jurisdictions as 
        water supplies in Arizona become more scarce; and
            (2) to authorize the Secretary to approve any Lease or 
        Exchange Agreements or Storage Agreements entered into by

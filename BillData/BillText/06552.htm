    In order to increase the prevention efforts by the United States

Development shall encourage integration of activities to counter 
trafficking in persons (C-TIP) into broader assistance programming. The 
Administrator shall--
            (1) determine a reasonable definition for the term ``C-TIP 
        Integrated Development Programs'', which shall at a minimum 
        include any programming to address health, economic 
        development, education, democracy and governance, food security 
        and humanitarian assistance that the Administrator determines 
        includes a sufficient counter-trafficking in persons element 
        integrated in the program design or delivery;
            (2) encourage that any program design or delivery that may 
        directly serve victims of trafficking in persons is age-
        appropriate, linguistically accessible, culturally responsive, 
        and survivor- and trauma-informed, and provides opportunities 
        for anonymous and voluntary feedback from the beneficiaries 
        receiving such services;
            (3) encourage that each USAID mission integrates a counter-
        trafficking in persons perspective and specific approaches into 
        development programs, project design, and methods for program 
        monitoring and evaluation, when addressing a range of 
        development issues, including--
                    (A) health;
                    (B) economic development;
                    (C) education;

        Strategies include a counter-trafficking in persons analytic 
        component to guide future project design and promote the 
        inclusion of counter-trafficking elements in project design, 
        implementation, monitoring, and evaluation required for Tier 2 
        Watch List and Tier 3 countries (as such terms are defined for

SEC. 204. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON HUMAN TRAFFICKING CRISIS IN UKRAINE.

targeting civilians and non-military infrastructure has led to millions 
to flee their homes--90 percent of them being women and children 
according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees--
creating a humanitarian and human trafficking crisis, as Russian 
President Putin continues to wage the largest and most lethal war in 
Europe since World War II.

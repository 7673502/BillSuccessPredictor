                    TITLE I--CLIMATE-READY FISHERIES

SEC. 101. FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND POLICY.

    Section 2 (16 U.S.C. 1801) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) by amending paragraph (2) to read as follows:
            ``(2) Certain stocks of fish have declined to the point 
        where their survival is threatened, and other stocks of fish 
        have been so substantially reduced in number that they could 
        become similarly threatened as a consequence of--
                    ``(A) increased fishing pressure;
                    ``(B) the inadequacy of fishery resource 
                conservation and management practices and controls;
                    ``(C) direct and indirect habitat losses which have 
                resulted in a diminished capacity to support existing 
                fishing levels; or
                    ``(D) changing environmental conditions, including 
                those associated with climate change.'';
                    (B) in paragraph (6), by inserting ``to account for 
                the impacts of environmental changes on stocks of 
                fish,'' after ``insure conservation,'';
                    (C) by amending paragraph (9) to read as follows:
            ``(9) One of the greatest long term threats to the 
        viability of commercial and recreational fisheries is the 
        continuing degradation of marine ecosystems, including the loss 
        of marine, estuarine, and other aquatic habitats, including as 
        a result of changing environmental conditions associated with 
        climate change. Habitat and ecosystem considerations should 
        receive increased attention for the conservation and management 
        of fishery resources of the United States.'';
                    (D) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(14) Environmental changes associated with climate 
        change, including changes in water temperature, ocean 
        acidification, and deoxygenation, are rapidly altering the 
        abundance, productivity, and distribution of fish and are 
        affecting commercial, recreational, and subsistence fisheries.
            ``(15) The impacts of climate change on fish and their 
        habitats are resulting in management and sustainability 
        challenges that threaten to negatively impact marine 
        ecosystems, fishery resources, and coastal communities.
            ``(16) Many factors beyond the direct impacts of fishing 
        can contribute to a decline in abundance of a stock of fish, 
        resulting in depleted fish stocks and threatening the stability 
        of ecosystems and fishing communities, including climate 
        change, pollution, habitat and watershed degradation, 
        inadequate freshwater resources, and industrial uses of the 
        ocean. The designation of a stock of fish as overfished 
        indicates that it is depleted and management actions are 
        necessary to allow the stock to rebuild, regardless of the 
        cause of depletion.'';
            (2) by amending subsection (b)(5) to read as follows:
            ``(5) to establish Regional Fishery Management Councils to 
        exercise sound judgement in the stewardship of fishery 
        resources through the preparation, monitoring, and revision of 
        such plans under circumstances--
                    ``(A) which will enable the States, the fishing 
                industry, consumer and environmental organizations, and 
                other interested persons to participate in, and advise 
                on, the establishment and administration of such plans;
                    ``(B) which take into account the social and 
                economic needs of the States; and
                    ``(C) which address the impacts of environmental 
                conditions associated with climate change on stocks of 
                fish, marine ecosystems, fisheries management, and 
                coastal communities;''; and
            (3) in subsection (c)--
                    (A) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'' after the 
                semicolon at the end;
                    (B) in paragraph (7), by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting a semicolon; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(8) to promote management that accounts for changes in 
        stocks of fish and the marine environment that result from 
        climate change; and
            ``(9) to ensure that the research, resource management, and 
        expenditures to prepare fisheries and fishing communities for 
        climate change promote racial and socioeconomic equity with 
        respect to environmental, economic, and social outcomes across 
        fisheries and regions.''.

SEC. 102. PROMOTING CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN FISHERIES MANAGEMENT.

    (a) In General.--Section 303(a) (16 U.S.C. 1853(a)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting ``and to promote the 
        resilience of fish stocks to cumulative stressors, including 
        cumulative stressors associated with climate change'' before 
        the semicolon at the end;
            (2) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``including considering 
        the impacts of climate change,'' after ``fishery,'';
            (3) in paragraph (8), by striking ``1991'' and inserting 
        ``2022'', and by inserting ``, including data needed to 
        implement the plan effectively under prevailing and anticipated 
        environmental or ecological conditions, including climate 
        change'' before the semicolon at the end;
            (4) in paragraph (13), by inserting ``as well as examine 
        the vulnerability of the fishery and fishery participants to 
        the impacts of prevailing and anticipated environmental or 
        ecological conditions, including climate change'' before the 
        semicolon at the end;
            (5) in paragraph (14), by striking ``and;'' and inserting a 
        semicolon;
            (6) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (15) and 
        inserting ``; and''; and
            (7) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(16) assess and describe the anticipated impacts of 
        climate change and other environmental and ecological changes 
        on the fishery, including an assessment of whether and how the 
        management measures contained in the plan or plan amendment 
        have accounted for these changes, and a summary of the 
        information used in these assessments;
            ``(17) describe and identify the current range and 
        distribution of, and fishing patterns on, fish stocks managed 
        under the plan, including areas outside the jurisdiction of the 
        Council having authority to issue the plan, and for fish stocks 
        whose distribution crosses management boundaries, describe the 
        measures used for coordination with other relevant management 
        bodies for the conservation and management of the fish stock; 
        and''.

    ``(g) Allocation of Grants to Local Governments and Other 
Entities.--
            ``(1) Designation of qualified holder.--Subject to the

        approved working waterfront plan, designate as a qualified 
        holder any unit of State or local government or nongovernmental 
        organization, if the coastal State is ultimately responsible 
        for ensuring that the property will be managed in a manner that 
        is consistent with the purposes for which the land entered into 
        the program.
            ``(2) Allocation.--A coastal State or a qualified holder 
        designated by a coastal State may allocate to a unit of local 
        government, nongovernmental organization, fishing cooperative, 
        or other entity, a portion of any grant made under this section

        responsibility for ensuring that any funds so allocated are 
        applied in furtherance of the coastal State's approved working 
        waterfronts plan.

                waterfront or interest in working waterfronts to 
                another qualified holder.
    ``(h) Matching Contributions.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        Secretary shall require that each coastal State that receives a 
        grant under this section, or a qualified holder designated by 
        that coastal State under subsection (g), shall provide matching 
        funds in an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the total 
        cost of the project carried out with the grant. As a condition 
        of receipt of a grant under this section, the Secretary shall 
        require that a coastal State provide to the Secretary such 
        assurances as the Secretary determines are sufficient to 
        demonstrate that the share of the cost of each eligible project 
        that is not funded by the grant awarded under this section has 
        been secured.
            ``(2) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of 
        paragraph (1) for any qualified holder that is an underserved 
        community, a community that has an inability to draw on other 
        sources of funding because of the small population or low 
        income of the community, or for other reasons the Secretary 
        considers appropriate.
            ``(3) In-kind contributions.--A local community designated 
        as a qualified holder under subsection (g) may use funds or 
        other in-kind contributions donated by a nongovernmental 
        partner to satisfy the matching funds requirement under this 
        subsection.
            ``(4) Funding from other federal source.--If financial 
        assistance under this section represents only a portion of the 
        total cost of a project, funding from other Federal sources may 
        be applied to the cost of the project.
            ``(5) Value of a working waterfront.--The Secretary shall 
        treat as non-Federal match the value of a working waterfront or 
        interest in a working waterfront, including conservation and 
        other easements, that is held in perpetuity by a qualified 
        holder, if the working waterfront or interest is identified in 
        the application for the grant and acquired by the qualified 
        holder not later than three years of the grant award date, or 
        not later than three years after the submission of the 
        application and before the end of the grant award period. Such 
        value shall be determined by an appraisal performed at such 
        time before the award of the grant as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.
            ``(6) Other considerations.--The Secretary shall treat as 
        non-Federal match the costs associated with acquisition of a 
        working waterfront or an interest in a working waterfront, and 
        the costs of restoration, enhancement, or other improvement to 
        a working waterfront, if the activities are identified in the 
        project application and the costs are incurred within the 
        period of the grant award, or, for working waterfront described 
        in paragraph (6), within the same time limits described in that 
        paragraph. Such costs may include either cash or in-kind 
        contributions.
    ``(i) Limit on Administrative Costs.--The Secretary may not use 
more than 5 percent of the funds made available under this section may 
for planning or administration of the program under this section.

        appropriated under this section to provide technical assistance 
        as described in this subsection.

            TITLE IV--MODERNIZING FISHERIES SCIENCE AND DATA

SEC. 401. DATA MODERNIZATION.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary, acting through the Assistant 
Administrator for Fisheries, shall provide to Congress an 
implementation plan for the Fisheries Information Management 
Modernization initiative. Such plan shall include a description of--
            (1) activities for the goals and objectives of the 
        initiative;
            (2) a schedule for implementation;
            (3) an estimated budget;
            (4) a plan for stakeholder engagement for development of 
        user-centric systems, processes, and policies; and
            (5) how the initiative will align with other National 
        Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data management efforts 
        to provide for efficiency and interoperability including such 
        Administration's Data Strategy, Cloud Strategy, and Artificial 
        Intelligence strategy.
    (b) Information From Experts.--In carrying out this section, the 
Secretary shall solicit information, as needed, from data management 
and technology experts inside and outside the government.
    (c) Report.--The Secretary shall annually report to Congress on 
progress in carrying out this section.

SEC. 402. EXPANDING AND IMPROVING ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.-- It is the sense of Congress that the use 
of electronic technologies such as digital video cameras and monitors, 
digital recording systems, and other forms of electronic technology as 
a complement to, and in some cases a replacement for, observers may 
maintain, increase, or improve the amount and accuracy of observer and 
fishery dependent information collected from fisheries while reducing 
costs and logistical difficulties. To achieve optimum yields on a 
continuing basis while conserving and maintaining fisheries and 
integrating healthy ecosystem considerations, managers require 
reliable, timely data across all regions and fishing sectors for 
conservation, management, and scientific purposes. To achieve 
management goals especially in the context of climate change, the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should work to meet 
evolving management needs and, in collaboration with industry 
stakeholders, identify appropriate data collection technologies and 
strategies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should 
also consider the use of innovative technology in fishery independent 
data collection including stock and habitat assessments and 
environmental conditions.
    (b) Fishery Management Councils.--Section 303(b)(8) (16 U.S.C. 
1853(b)(8)) is amended to read as follows:
            ``(8) require the collection of data necessary for the 
        conservation and management of the fishery to be collected from 
        a vessel of the United States engaged in fishing for species 
        that are subject to the plan through--
                    ``(A) electronic monitoring or other electronic 
                technology; or
                    ``(B) observers carried onboard such vessel, except 
                that such a vessel shall not be required to carry an 
                observer on board if the facilities of the vessel for 
                the quartering of an observer, or for carrying out 
                observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that 
                the health or safety of the observer or the safe 
                operation of the vessel would be jeopardized;''.
    (c) Information Systems.--Section 402(a) (16 U.S.C. 1881a(a)) is 
amended--
            (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``The Council shall 
        consider the use of electronic monitoring and reporting or 
        other electronic technology as part of an information 
        collection program under this subsection.'' after ``request.'';
            (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``The Secretary shall 
        consider the use of electronic monitoring and reporting or 
        other electronic technology as part of an information 
        collection program.'' after ``fishery.''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Secretarial review.--Not less often than once every 5 
        years, the Secretary shall review the procedures and policies 
        by which information is collected, managed, and used to manage 
        fisheries and revise information collection programs and 
        policies needed to integrate data collection and management, 
        improve the timeliness, quality, usability, cost-effectiveness, 
        and to reduce unnecessary duplication within and across fishery 
        management plans and regions. Upon the completion of each such 
        review, the Secretary shall publish a report for the public 
        describing the findings of such review and planned revisions to 
        information collection programs.''.

                                 A BILL


 
     To promote freedom of information and counter censorship and 
          surveillance in North Korea, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Otto Warmbier Countering North 
Korean Censorship and Surveillance Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The information landscape in North Korea is the most 
        repressive in the world, consistently ranking last or near-last 
        in the annual World Press Freedom Index.
            (2) Under the brutal rule of Kim Jung Un, the country's 
        leader since 2012, the North Korean regime has tightened 
        controls on access to information, as well as enacted harsh 
        punishments for consumers of outside media, including 
        sentencing to time in a concentration camp and a maximum 
        penalty of death.
            (3) Such repressive and unjust laws surrounding information 
        in North Korea resulted in the death of 22-year-old United 
        States citizen and university student Otto Warmbier, who had 
        traveled to North Korea in December 2015 as part of a guided 
        tour.
            (4) Otto Warmbier was unjustly arrested, sentenced to 15 
        years of hard labor, and severely mistreated at the hands of 
        North Korean officials. While in captivity, Otto Warmbier 
        suffered a serious medical emergency that placed him into a 
        comatose state. Otto Warmbier was comatose upon his release in 
        June 2017 and died 6 days later.
            (5) Despite increased penalties for possession and 
        viewership of foreign media, the people of North Korea have 
        increased their desire for foreign media content, according to 
        a survey of 200 defectors concluding that 90 percent had 
        watched South Korean or other foreign media before defecting.
            (6) On March 23, 2021, in an annual resolution, the United 
        Nations General Assembly condemned ``the long-standing and 
        ongoing systematic, widespread and gross violations of human 
        rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea'' and 
        expressed grave concern at, among other things, ``the denial of 
        the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion . . . 
        and of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and 
        association, both online and offline, which is enforced through 
        an absolute monopoly on information and total control over 
        organized social life, and arbitrary and unlawful state 
        surveillance that permeates the private lives of all 
        citizens''.
            (7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive damage to 15 
        broadcast antennas used by the United States Agency for Global 
        Media in Asia, resulting in reduced programming to North Korea. 
        The United States Agency for Global Media has rebuilt 5 of the 
        15 antenna systems as of June 2021.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in the event of a crisis situation, particularly where 
        information pertaining to the crisis is being actively censored 
        or a false narrative is being put forward, the United States 
        should be able to quickly increase its broadcasting capability 
        to deliver fact-based information to audiences, including those 
        in North Korea; and
            (2) the United States International Broadcasting Surge 
        Capacity Fund is already authorized under section 316 of the 
        United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 
        6216), and expanded authority to transfer unobligated balances 
        from expired accounts of the United States Agency for Global 
        Media would enable the Agency to more nimbly respond to crises.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

     It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to provide the people of North Korea with access to a 
        diverse range of fact-based information;
            (2) to develop and implement novel means of communication 
        and information sharing that increase opportunities for 
        audiences in North Korea to safely create, access, and share 
        digital and non-digital news without fear of repressive 
        censorship, surveillance, or penalties under law; and
            (3) to foster and innovate new technologies to counter 
        North Korea's state-sponsored repressive surveillance and 
        censorship by advancing internet freedom tools, technologies, 
        and new approaches.

SEC. 4. UNITED STATES STRATEGY TO COMBAT NORTH KOREA'S REPRESSIVE 
              INFORMATION ENVIRONMENT.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President shall develop and submit to 
Congress a strategy on combating North Korea's repressive information 
environment.
    (b) Elements.--The strategy required by subsection (a) shall 
include the following:
            (1) An assessment of the challenges to the free flow of 
        information into North Korea created by the censorship and 
        surveillance technology apparatus of the Government of North 
        Korea.
            (2) A detailed description of the agencies and other 
        government entities, key officials, and security services 
        responsible for the implementation of North Korea's repressive 
        laws regarding foreign media consumption.
            (3) A detailed description of the agencies and other 
        government entities and key officials of foreign governments 
        that assist, facilitate, or aid North Korea's repressive 
        censorship and surveillance state.
            (4) A review of existing public-private partnerships that 
        provide circumvention technology and an assessment of the 
        feasibility and utility of new tools to increase free 
        expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive 
        surveillance in North Korea.
            (5) A description of and funding levels required for 
        current United States Government programs and activities to 
        provide access for the people of North Korea to a diverse range 
        of fact-based information.
            (6) An update of the plan required by section 104(a)(7)(A) 
        of the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 (22 U.S.C. 
        7814(a)(7)(A)).
            (7) A description of Department of State programs and 
        funding levels for programs that promote internet freedom in 
        North Korea, including monitoring and evaluation efforts.
            (8) A description of grantee programs of the United States 
        Agency for Global Media in North Korea that facilitate 
        circumvention tools and broadcasting, including monitoring and 
        evaluation efforts.
            (9) A detailed assessment of how the United States 
        International Broadcasting Surge Capacity Fund authorized under 
        section 316 of the United States International Broadcasting Act 
        of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216) has operated to respond to crisis 
        situations in the past, and how authority to transfer 
        unobligated balances from expired accounts would help the 
        United States Agency for Global Media in crisis situations in 
        the future.
            (10) A detailed plan for how the authorization of 
        appropriations under section 7 will operate alongside and 
        augment existing programming from the relevant Federal agencies 
        and facilitate the development of new tools to assist that 
        programming.
    (c) Form of Strategy.--The strategy required by subsection (a) 
shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include the matters 
required by paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) in a classified 
annex.

SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REPORT ON THE CAPACITY OF FEDERALLY-
              ASSISTED HOUSING TO SUPPORT BROADBAND SERVICE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States 
shall submit to Congress a report on the capacity of Federally-assisted 
housing to support broadband service.
    (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a) shall 
include--
            (1) an analysis that identifies which Federally-assisted 
        housing has access to broadband service and which such housing 
        does not have access to broadband service, disaggregated by 
        State, congressional district, ZIP Code, and census tract, that 
        includes demographic information and any Federal agency 
        responsible for such housing;
            (2) an analysis of which such housing does not currently 
        have the capacity to support broadband service deployment and 
        would require retrofitting to support broadband service 
        deployment, disaggregated by State, congressional district, ZIP 
        Code, and census tract, that includes demographic information 
        and any Federal agency responsible for such housing;
            (3) an analysis of the estimated costs and timeframe 
        necessary for all Federally-assisted housing to have the 
        capacity to support broadband service;
            (4) an analysis of the challenges to more widespread 
        deployment of broadband service, including the comparative 
        market dynamics to expansion in rural areas and low-income 
        urban and suburban areas, and the challenges to pursuing 
        retrofits for all Federally-assisted housing to have the 
        capacity to support broadband service;
            (5) descriptions of lessons learned from previous 
        retrofitting actions;
            (6) an evaluation of the ConnectHome pilot program of the 
        Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and
            (7) recommendations for Congress to allow for all 
        Federally-assisted housing to have the capacity to support 
        broadband service under a range of specific projected 
        timelines.

consultation with the Comptroller General and other relevant heads of

        housing, as necessary, to support broadband service; and
            (2) submit such plan to the Congress not later than 18 
        months after the date of the enactment of this Act.

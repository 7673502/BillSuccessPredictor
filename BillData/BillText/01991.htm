            (1) a review of State laws, regulations, and practices on 
        how child neglect and custody situations are handled in

        costs and risks of divorce from an abusive partner to a victim 
        of domestic violence, including the payment of alimony, legal 
        fees, spousal support, or the division of property, 
        disaggregated on the basis of whether the individual has higher 
        earnings than their partner; and

        under paragraph (1).

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    This Act may be cited as the ``Eradicating Narcotic Drugs and 
Formulating Effective New Tools to Address National Yearly Losses of 
life Act'' or the ``END FENTANYL Act''.

SEC. 2. ENSURING TIMELY UPDATES TO U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION 
              FIELD MANUALS.

    (a) In General.--Not less frequently than triennially, the 
Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection shall review and 
update, as necessary, the current policies and manuals of the Office of 
Field Operations related to inspections at ports of entry to ensure the

respond to technological and methodological changes designed to 
disguise illegal activity, such as the smuggling of drugs and humans, 
along the border.

under subsection (a), the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alabama Underwater Forest National 
Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) An ancient cypress forest dating back 50,000 to 70,000 
        years has been exposed in the Gulf of Mexico off the Alabama 
        coastline.
            (2) The cypress trees, which were uncovered by massive 
        waves associated with Hurricane Ivan, are still rooted in the 
        mud they were growing in at least 50,000 years ago.
            (3) The Underwater Forest site is unique on a global scale, 
        the only known site where trees between 50,000 and 70,000 years 
        old have been preserved intact with the ecosystem they were 
        growing in.
            (4) Exploration of the site continues to yield invaluable 
        scientific insight in a variety of fields, though scientists 
        have just begun to study the ancient forest.

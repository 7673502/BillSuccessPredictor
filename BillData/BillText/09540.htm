                                 A BILL


 
To authorize assistance to support activities relating to the clearance 
of landmines, unexploded ordnance, and other explosive remnants of war 
   in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and to recognize the refugee and 
   immigrant communities who supported and defended the Armed Forces 
     during the conflict in Southeast Asia, including Hmong, Cham, 
 Cambodian, Iu-Mien, Khmu, Lao, Montagnard, and Vietnamese Americans, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Legacies of War Recognition and 
Unexploded Ordnance Removal Act''.

SEC. 2. RECOGNITION OF THE COMMUNITIES WHO SUPPORTED AND DEFENDED THE 
              ARMED FORCES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) During the conflict in Southeast Asia during the 1960s 
        and 1970s, many Hmong, Cham, Cambodians, Iu-Mien, Khmu, Lao, 
        Montagnard, and Vietnamese people--
                    (A) fought and died with the Armed Forces;
                    (B) rescued United States pilots shot down in 
                enemy-controlled territory and returned the pilots to 
                safety;
                    (C) gathered and provided intelligence to the Armed 
                Forces about enemy troop positions, movement, and 
                strength; and
                    (D) provided food, shelter, and support to members 
                of the Armed Forces.
            (2) The national armed forces of Cambodia facilitated the 
        evacuation of the United States Embassy in Phnom Penh on April 
        12, 1975, by fighting Khmer Rouge forces that advanced upon the 
        capital.
            (3) A tragic legacy of the conflict in Southeast Asia is 
        the lethal risk posed by landmines, unexploded ordnance (in 
        this Act, referred to as ``UXO''), and explosive remnants of 
        war in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia that still litter forests, 
        rice fields, villages, school grounds, roads, and other 
        populated areas, hindering development and efforts to reduce 
        poverty.
            (4) Vietnam remains one of the world's most contaminated 
        countries, with an estimated 800,000 tons of UXO left over from 
        the conflict in Southeast Asia that ended more than 40 years 
        ago. Since 1975, UXO accidents have caused more than 105,000 
        casualties, including more than 38,000 deaths of Vietnamese 
        civilians.
            (5) In Laos, much of the country's land remains 
        contaminated with tens of millions of small, unexploded cluster 
        munitions. Since 1964, UXO and other explosive remnants of war 
        have injured or killed more than 50,000 civilians in Laos.
            (6) Cambodia has experienced one of the highest rates of 
        landmine and UXO casualties in the world. Over 64,000 
        Cambodians have been injured or killed by landmines, UXO, or 
        other explosive remnants of war since 1979.
            (7) The United States is the world's leading financial 
        supporter of demining and programs to remove UXO. Since 1993, 
        the United States has provided more than $3,700,000,000 in 
        assistance to locate and destroy UXO and other explosive 
        remnants of war in more than 100 countries, including more than 
        $148,000,000 in Vietnam, $230,000,000 in Laos, and $154,000,000 
        in Cambodia.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Hmong, Cham, Cambodian, Iu-Mien, Khmu, Lao, 
        Montagnard, and Vietnamese people deserve recognition for their 
        support and defense of the Armed Forces during the conflict in 
        Southeast Asia; and
            (2) the United States should continue to support activities 
        to clear landmines, UXO, and other explosive remnants of war in 
        Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, while strengthening people-to-
        people ties and reaffirming the long-standing commitment of the 
        United States to Southeast Asia.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE FOR VIETNAM, LAOS, AND CAMBODIA.

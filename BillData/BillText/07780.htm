SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Student Mental Health Rights 
Act''.

SEC. 802. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Nearly all institutions of higher education are subject 
        to--
                    (A) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
                U.S.C. 12101 et seq.);
                    (B) section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 
                (29 U.S.C. 794); or
                    (C) the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.).
            (2) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        discrimination on the basis of disability, defined as ``with 
        respect to an individual, a physical or mental impairment that 
        substantially limits one or more major life activities of such 
        individual, a record of such an impairment, or being regarded 
        as having such an impairment'' under section 3(1) of the 
        Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102(1)).
            (3) Under section 2(a)(3) of the Americans with 
        Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101(a)(3)), Congress 
        found that ``discrimination against individuals with 
        disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, 
        housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, 
        communication, recreation, institutionalization, health 
        services, voting, and access to public services''.
            (4) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        institutions of higher education from discriminating against 
        students with disabilities, including by failing to provide 
        reasonable accommodations or reasonable modifications to such 
        students so that such students are able to fully participate in 
        postsecondary life.
            (5) The laws described in paragraph (1) prohibit 
        institutions of higher education from discriminating against 
        students with mental health disabilities, including by failing 
        to provide reasonable accommodations or reasonable 
        modifications to such a student.
            (6) The vast majority of institutions of higher education 
        lack a comprehensive plan for addressing and preventing 
        discrimination against students with mental health disabilities 
        or who are experiencing crises, in many cases--
                    (A) requiring such students to leave the 
                institution of higher education;
                    (B) evicting such students from on-campus housing; 
                and
                    (C) establishing excessive and unnecessary 
                impediments to the re-enrollment of such students to 
                the institution of higher education.

SEC. 803. STUDY.

        from such an absence, and compliance by institutions of higher 
        education with such policies; and
            (3) best practices for supporting students at institutions 
        of higher education in managing such conditions, including the

        seq.) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
        U.S.C. 794) with respect to students with mental health 
        disabilities;
            (2) the legal obligations of institutions of higher

SEC. 901. OCCUPATIONAL RESEARCH PROGRAM ON MENTAL HEALTH.

    (a) In General.--The Director of the National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (in this section referred to as the 
``Institute'') shall establish a research program to identify and apply 
comprehensive approaches to support frontline, essential, and other 
affected workers across all industries and occupations exposed to and 
affected by workplace stressors that contribute to adverse mental 
health outcomes, including traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, 
suicide, and related mental health conditions. In designing such 
research program, the Director shall, in consultation with the heads of 
other Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, address 
workplace stressors such as--
            (1) traumatic grief resulting from COVID-19-related death 
        or injury in the workplace;
            (2) conditions of employment or places of employment, 
        including consecutive shifts, increases in shift duration, 
        changes in workplace protocols, or increases in workloads and 
        demands due to insufficient resources, which can result in 
        fatal, near-fatal, or other serious occupational injuries or 
        illnesses; or
            (3) workplace violence or other physical and psychological 
        hazards that contribute to worker injury or illness on the job, 
        including poor mental health outcomes among workers.
    (b) Best Practices and Recommendations.--As part of the research 
program established under this section, the Director shall develop best 
practices or recommendations for organizational-level workplace 
interventions and support services that would both prevent worker 
injury or illness and reduce the risk of such adverse mental health 
outcomes among frontline, essential, and other affected workers across 
all industries and occupations, including wraparound services, mental 
health awareness initiatives, workplace stress prevention programs, and 
training programs to promote work-related stress prevention and 
reduction and organizational resilience, to include specific strategies 
for preventing burnout among workers.
    (c) Additional Support.--As part of such research program, the 
Director shall also coordinate and support efforts through other 
research programs carried out by the Institute, including the 
Institute's Total Worker Health program, to develop comprehensive, 
evidence-informed approaches to support mental and behavioral health as 
a part of worker wellbeing and related occupational safety and health 
programs.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Director shall--
            (1) report to the Committee on Education and Labor of the 
        House of Representatives and the Committee on Health, 
        Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate on the extent to 
        which best practices or recommendations developed pursuant to 
        subsection (b) have been adopted by relevant stakeholders; and
            (2) engage in education and outreach activities with 
        employers, health care providers, nonprofit organizations, 
        workers, labor organizations, and related stakeholders to 
        support such adoption.

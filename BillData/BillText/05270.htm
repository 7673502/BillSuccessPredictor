    Part A of title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 281 
et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 404O. GAIN-OF-FUNCTION RESEARCH.

    ``(a) Prohibition.--During the period ending on September 30, 2026, 
the National Institutes of Health shall not conduct or support, 
directly or indirectly, including through subgrants, any gain-of-
function research that may be reasonably anticipated to confer 
attributes to any influenza virus or coronavirus (including any 
coronavirus that is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome) 
such that the virus would have enhanced pathogenicity or 
transmissibility in mammals via the respiratory route.
    ``(b) Limitation.--This section does not apply to characterization 
or testing of any naturally occurring influenza virus or coronavirus, 
unless the characterization or testing is anticipated to increase 
pathogenicity or transmissibility.''.

SEC. 2. PERFORMANCE-BASED NAVIGATION IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS.

    (a) In General.--In carrying out the implementation process for 
NextGen performance-based navigation (as described in FAA Order 
JO7100.41A, or any subsequent similar order), the Administrator of the 
Federal Aviation Administration shall ensure that any covered aviation 
roundtable may appoint a technical representative or consultant to 
participate as member of the core working group or the full working 
group of such process on the same terms and conditions as a 
representative of the industry, an airport, or a participating 
proponent of a procedure.
    (b) Covered Aviation Roundtable Defined.--The term ``covered 
aviation roundtable'' means an aviation roundtable--
            (1) that is the actual or de facto proponent of a proposed 
        new or modified performance-based navigation flight procedure; 
        or
            (2) for which the modified procedure path to be implemented 
        in the process described in subsection (a) is within 5 miles of 
        the jurisdictional area of the aviation roundtable.
    (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall submit to the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
Senate a report on the progress made toward implementing the 
requirements under subsection (a).

 To require recipients of assistance for certain water infrastructure 
projects to provide job training, apprenticeships, and other employment 
 opportunities for low-income persons and very low-income persons, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Water Investments Benefit 
Communities Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) Federal water infrastructure investments provide State 
        and local governments and other recipients of Federal financial 
        assistance with substantial support for activities that produce 
        significant employment and other economic opportunities;
            (2) low-income persons and very low-income persons, who 
        live in the areas in most need of such investments, often have 
        restricted access to employment and other economic 
        opportunities;
            (3) the employment and other economic opportunities 
        generated by projects and activities that receive Federal water 
        infrastructure investments offer an effective means of 
        empowering low-income persons and very low-income persons, 
        particularly those who live in the areas where these funds are 
        being used to improve water infrastructure; and
            (4) Federal efforts to invest in water infrastructure 
        should also help create employment and other economic 
        opportunities for low-income persons and very low-income 
        persons in areas where these projects are taking place.

        Protecting European Energy Security through Sanctions Act 
        (PEESA) in connection with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
            (3) A description of how sanctions on Russia's financial

        Russia's energy exports to Europe.
            (4) A description of how the President will use economic 
        sanctions to permanently and irreversibly stop the Nord Stream

        operation, or development.
            (5) A description of how diplomatic efforts could be 
        utilized to bring together our European and NATO allies, 
        including Germany, to permanently and irreversibly stop the 
        Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
            (6) A description of how Russia's growing relationship with 
        China and Iran in the energy sector effects United States 
        security interests.
            (7) A description of how the President will end the 
        moratorium on oil and gas leases on public land.
            (8) A description of how diplomatic efforts could be

                a borrower;

                status as a nonprofit organization, or another method;

                approve each application for such loans and eliminate 
                any processes of the Administration that allow for 
                simultaneous approval of multiple loan applications;
                    (F) require an individual employee of the 
                Administration to contact applicants who submit 
                multiple loan applications from the same Internet 
                Protocol addresses, email addresses, or physical 
                addresses, or with the same bank account numbers, to 
                verify eligibility of such applicants;
                    (G) ensure that such borrower is not included on 
                the ``Do Not Pay List'' of the Department of the 
                Treasury (as described under section 3354 of title 31, 
                United States Code);
                    (H) prevent duplicate loan applications with the 
                same employer identification number or social security 
                number; and
                    (I) establish a system to prevent disbursement of 
                such loans to applicants that submit more than one loan 
                application with the same employer identification 
                number, social security number, email addresses, 
                physical addresses, or bank account number, or from the 
                same Internet Protocol address.

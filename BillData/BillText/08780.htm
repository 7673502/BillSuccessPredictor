                                 A BILL


 
To improve hiring authorities available to the Secretary of State with 
         respect to expertise on China, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expand eXpertise in China Education 
and Language Act'' or the ``EXCEL Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) strategic competition with the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Chinese Communist 
        Party (CCP) is the most significant geostrategic challenge the 
        United States faces to security and prosperity in the 21st 
        century;
            (2) the United States Government needs to further invest in 
        relevant linguistic, cultural, and regional expertise to 
        effectively engage in strategic competition with the People's 
        Republic of China; and
            (3) existing hiring authorities across the Executive Branch 
        are not being adequately utilized to bring in necessary 
        expertise to win the strategic competition against the People's 
        Republic of China, and that agencies may benefit from 
        additional flexibility to recruit, hire, and retain talent.

                          for other purposes.

United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Granite Mountain Hotshots 
Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) ``Hotshots'' are elite firefighters that specialize in 
        the containment of wildfires.
            (2) On June 28, 2013, lighting ignited the Yarnell Hill 
        Fire on a ridge west of Yarnell, Arizona, and the fire spread 
        rapidly.
            (3) Firefighters from the Granite Mountain Interagency 
        Hotshot Crew (hereafter in this Act referred to as the 
        ``Granite Mountain Hotshots''), a crew within the Prescott Fire 
        Department, were deployed to assist with the containment of the 
        Yarnell Hill Fire.
            (4) On June 30, 2013, 19 firefighters from the Granite 
        Mountain Hotshots perished while attempting to contain the 
        Yarnell Hill Fire and preserve the lives and livelihoods of the 
        residents of Yarnell. The 19 firefighters were--
                    (A) Andrew Ashcraft, age 29;
                    (B) Robert Caldwell, age 23;
                    (C) Travis Carter, age 31;
                    (D) Dustin Deford, age 24;
                    (E) Christopher MacKenzie, age 30;
                    (F) Eric Marsh, age 43;
                    (G) Grant McKee, age 21;
                    (H) Sean Misner, age 26;
                    (I) Scott Norris, age 28;
                    (J) Wade Parker, age 22;
                    (K) John Percin, age 24;
                    (L) Anthony Rose, age 23;
                    (M) Jesse Steed, age 36;
                    (N) Joe Thurston, age 32;
                    (O) Travis Turbyfill, age 27;
                    (P) William Warneke, age 25;
                    (Q) Clayton Whitted, age 28;
                    (R) Kevin Woyjeck, age 21; and
                    (S) Garret Zuppiger, age 27.
            (5) Of the 20 Granite Mountain Hotshots fighting the 
        Yarnell Hill Fire, only the lookout, Brendan McDonough, 
        survived. Brendan McDonough is now a motivational speaker who 
        honors the legacy of the 19 fallen Granite Mountain Hotshots.
            (6) The Yarnell Hill Fire was the deadliest wildfire in the 
        history of the State of Arizona. The Yarnell Hill Fire was the 
        deadliest wildfire in the United States for firefighters since 
        the year 1933 and the third deadliest wildfire in the history 
        of the United States. The Yarnell Hill Fire resulted in more 
        firefighter deaths in the United States than any single 
        occurrence since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
            (7) Every year, on June 30, residents of Yarnell honor the 
        Granite Mountain Hotshots.
            (8) The Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park, 
        located on the site of the Yarnell Hill Fire, was dedicated to 
        the Granite Mountain Hotshots in the year 2016.

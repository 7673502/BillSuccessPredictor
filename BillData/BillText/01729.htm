                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Federal Reserve Act to prohibit certain financial service 
    providers who deny fair access to financial services from using 
    taxpayer funded discount window lending programs, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Banking Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) article I of the Constitution of the United States 
        guarantees the people of the United States the right to enact 
        public policy through the free and fair election of 
        representatives and through the actions of State legislatures 
        and Congress;
            (2) banks rightly objected to the Operation Choke Point 
        initiative through which certain government agencies pressured 
        banks to cut off access to financial services to lawful sectors 
        of the economy;
            (3) banks are now, however, increasingly employing 
        subjective, category-based evaluations to deny certain persons 
        access to financial services in response to pressure from 
        advocates from across the political spectrum whose policy 
        objectives are served when banks deny certain customers access 
        to financial services;
            (4) the privatization of the discriminatory practices 
        underlying Operation Choke Point by banks represents as great a 
        threat to the national economy, national security, and the 
        soundness of banking and financial markets in the United States 
        as Operation Choke Point itself;
            (5) banks are supported by the United States taxpayers and 
        enjoy significant privileges in the financial system of the 
        United States and should not be permitted to act as de facto 
        regulators or unelected legislators by withholding financial 
        services to otherwise credit worthy businesses based on 
        subjective political reasons, bias or prejudices;
            (6) banks are not well-equipped to balance risks unrelated 
        to financial exposures and the operations required to deliver 
        financial services;
            (7) the United States taxpayers came to the aid for large 
        banks during the great recession of 2008 because they were 
        deemed too important to the national economy to be permitted to 
        fail;
            (8) when a bank predicates the access to financial services 
        of a person on factors or information (such as the lawful 
        products a customer manufactures or sells or the services the 
        customer provides) other than quantitative, impartial risk-
        based standards, the bank has failed to act consistent with 
        basic principles of sound risk management and failed to provide 
        fair access to financial services;
            (9) banks have a responsibility to make decisions about 
        whether to provide a person with financial services on the 
        basis of impartial criteria free from prejudice or favoritism;
            (10) while fair access to financial services does not 
        obligate a bank to offer any particular financial service to 
        the public, or to operate in any particular geographic area, or 
        to provide a service the bank offers to any particular person, 
        it is necessary that--
                    (A) the financial services a bank chooses to offer 
                in the geographic areas in which the bank operates be 
                made available to all customers based on the 
                quantitative, impartial risk-based standards of the 
                bank, and not based on whether the customer is in a 
                particular category of customers;
                    (B) banks assess the risks posed by individual 
                customers on a case-by-case basis, rather than 
                category-based assessment; and
                    (C) banks implement controls to manage 
                relationships commensurate with these risks associated 
                with each customer, not a strategy of total avoidance 
                of particular industries or categories of customers;
            (11) banks are free to provide or deny financial services 
        to any individual customer, but first, the banks must rely on 
        empirical data that are evaluated consistent with the 
        established, impartial risk-management standards of the bank; 
        and
            (12) anything less is not prudent risk management and may 
        result in unsafe or unsound practices, denial of fair access to 
        financial services, cancelling, or eliminating certain 
        businesses in society, and have a deleterious effect on 
        national security and the national economy.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) ensure fair access to financial services and fair 
        treatment of customers by financial service providers, 
        including national and State banks, Federal savings 
        associations, and State and Federal credit unions;
            (2) ensure banks conduct themselves in a safe and sound 
        manner, comply with laws and regulations, treat their customers 
        fairly, and provide fair access to financial services;
            (3) protect against banks being able to impede otherwise 
        lawful commerce and thereby achieve certain public policy 
        goals;
            (4) ensure that persons involved in politically unpopular 
        businesses but that are lawful under Federal law receive fair 
        access to financial services under the law; and
            (5) ensure banks operate in a safe and sound manner by 
        making judgments and decisions about whether to provide a 
        customer with financial services on an impartial, 
        individualized risk-based analysis using empirical data 
        evaluated under quantifiable standards.

                    (B) not deny any person a financial service the 
                covered bank offers unless the denial is justified by

                established in advance by the covered bank;

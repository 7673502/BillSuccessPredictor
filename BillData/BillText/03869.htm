 To amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
   to provide for cost estimates of major legislation, and for other 
                               purposes.

Committee on Taxation in providing estimates for spending and revenue 
legislation will always benefit the taxpayers whose monies Congress is 
entrusted.

Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974 is amended by adding at the end 
the following new section:

Government, international trade, international capital flows, and other 
macroeconomic variables resulting from such legislation.
    ``(b) JCT Cost Estimates.--An estimate provided by the Joint 
Committee on Taxation to the Director of the Congressional Budget 
Office under section 201(f) for any major legislation shall, to the 
extent practicable, incorporate the budgetary effects of changes in 
economic output, employment, capital stock, tax revenues, the sources 
of financing new outlays, the total debt of the Federal Government, 
international trade, international capital flows, and other 
macroeconomic variables resulting from such legislation.

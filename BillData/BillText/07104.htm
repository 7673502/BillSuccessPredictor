             semiconductor manufacturing investment credit.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Facilitating American-Built 
Semiconductors Act'' or the ``FABS Act''.

    (a) In General.--Subpart E of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by inserting after 
section 48C the following new section:

``SEC. 48D. SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT CREDIT.

    ``(a) In General.--For purposes of section 46, the semiconductor 
manufacturing investment credit for any taxable year is an amount equal 
to the sum of--
            ``(1) 25 percent of the qualified investment for such 
        taxable year with respect to any semiconductor manufacturing 
        facility property, and
            ``(2) 25 percent of the qualified semiconductor design 
        expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year.
    ``(b) Qualified Investment With Respect to Semiconductor 
Manufacturing Facility Property.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a)(1), the 
        qualified investment with respect to any semiconductor 
        manufacturing facility property for any taxable year is the 
        basis of any qualified property placed in service by the 
        taxpayer during such taxable year which is part of any 
        semiconductor manufacturing facility property.
            ``(2) Qualified property.--For purposes of this subsection, 
        the term `qualified property' means property--
                    ``(A) which is tangible property (including a 
                building or its structural components) which is an 
                integral part of any semiconductor manufacturing 
                facility property,
                    ``(B) with respect to which depreciation (or 
                amortization in lieu of depreciation) is allowable,
                    ``(C) which is--
                            ``(i) constructed, reconstructed, or 
                        erected by the taxpayer, or
                            ``(ii) acquired by the taxpayer if the 
                        original use of such property commences with 
                        the taxpayer, and
                    ``(D) the primary purpose of which is to

To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the members of the Women's Army 
    Corps who were assigned to the 6888th Central Postal Directory 
             Battalion, known as the ``Six Triple Eight''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ```Six Triple Eight' Congressional 
Gold Medal Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) On July 1, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed 
        into law legislation that established the Women's Army Corps 
        (referred to in this section as the ``WAC'') as a component in 
        the Army. The WAC was converted from the Women's Army Auxiliary 
        Corps (referred to in this section as the ``WAAC''), which had 
        been created in 1942 without official military status. First 
        Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune, the founder of 
        the National Council of Negro Women, advocated for the 
        admittance of African-American women into the newly formed WAC 
        to serve as officers and enlisted personnel.
            (2) Dubbed ``10 percenters'', the recruitment of African-
        American women to the WAAC was limited to 10 percent of the 
        population of the WAAC to match the proportion of African 
        Americans in the national population. Despite an Executive 
        order issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 banning 
        racial discrimination in civilian defense industries, the Armed 
        Forces remained segregated. Enlisted women served in segregated 
        units, participated in segregated training, lived in separate 
        quarters, ate at separate tables in mess halls, and used 
        segregated recreational facilities. Officers received their 
        officer candidate training in integrated units but lived under 
        segregated conditions. Specialist and technical training 
        schools were integrated in 1943. During World War II, a total 
        of 6,520 African-American women served in the WAAC and the WAC.
            (3) After several units of White women were sent to serve 
        in the European Theater of Operations (referred to in this 
        section as the ``ETO'') during World War II, African-American 
        organizations advocated for the War Department to extend the 
        opportunity to serve overseas to African-American WAC units.
            (4) In November 1944, the War Department approved sending 
        African-American women to serve in Europe. A battalion of all 
        African-American women drawn from the WAC, the Army Service 
        Forces, and the Army Air Forces was created and designated as 
        the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion (referred to in 
        this section as the ``6888th''), which was nicknamed the ``Six 
        Triple Eight''.
            (5) Army officials reported a shortage of qualified postal 
        officers within the ETO, which resulted in a backlog of 
        undelivered mail. As Allied forces drove across Europe, the 
        ever-changing locations of servicemembers hampered the delivery 
        of mail to those servicemembers. Because 7,000,000 civilians 
        and military personnel from the United States served in the 
        ETO, many of those individuals had identical names. For 
        example, 7,500 such individuals were named Robert Smith. One 
        general predicted that the backlog in Birmingham, England, 
        would take 6 months to process and the lack of reliable mail 
        service was hurting morale.
            (6) In February 1945, the 6888th arrived in Birmingham. 
        Upon their arrival, the 6888th found warehouses filled with 
        millions of pieces of mail intended for members of the Armed 
        Forces, United States Government personnel, and Red Cross 
        workers serving in the ETO.
            (7) The 6888th created effective processes and filing 
        systems to track individual servicemembers, organize 
        ``undeliverable'' mail, determine the intended recipient for 
        insufficiently addressed mail, and handle mail addressed to 
        servicemembers who had died. Adhering to their motto of ``No 
        mail, low morale'', the women processed an average of 65,000 
        pieces of mail per shift and cleared the 6-month backlog of 
        mail within 3 months.
            (8) The 6888th traveled to Rouen, France in May 1945 and 
        worked through a separate backlog of undelivered mail dating 
        back as far as 3 years.
            (9) At the completion of their mission, the unit returned 
        to the United States. The 6888th was discontinued on March 9, 
        1946, at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey.
            (10) The accomplishments of the 6888th in Europe encouraged 
        the General Board, United States Forces, European Theater of 
        Operations to adopt the following premise in their study of the 
        WAC issued in December 1945: ``[T]he national security program 
        is the joint responsibility of all Americans irrespective of 
        color or sex'' and ``the continued use of colored, along with 
        white, female military personnel is required in such strength 
        as is proportionately appropriate to the relative population 
        distribution between colored and white races''.
            (11) With the exception of smaller units of African-
        American nurses who served in Africa, Australia, and England, 
        the 6888th was the only African-American Women's Army Corps 
        unit to serve overseas during World War II.
            (12) The members of the ``Six Triple Eight'' received the 
        European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the Women's 
        Army Corps Service Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal 
        for their service.
            (13) In 2019, the Army awarded the 6888th the Meritorious 
        Unit Commendation.

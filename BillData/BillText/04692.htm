                to subsection (b)(1) in an order under subsection 
                (a)(5), the Administrator shall allow for protocols and 
                methodologies that test chemical substances that are 
                perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances as a 
                class.
                    ``(B) Period.--In determining the period to be

        chemical substance that is a perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl 
        substance required by an order under subsection (a)(5) would be 
        duplicative of information that has been submitted to the 
        Administrator in accordance with such order, or which is being 
        developed pursuant to such order, if the information concerns 
        the chemical substance with the same specific chemical identity 
        as the chemical substance for which the application for an 
        exemption is submitted.''.

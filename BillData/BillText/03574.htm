SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Filing Relief for Natural Disasters

SEC. 2. MODIFICATION OF RULES FOR POSTPONING CERTAIN DEADLINES BY 
              REASON OF DISASTER.

    (a) Authority To Postpone Federal Tax Deadlines by Reason of State-
Declared Disasters.--Section 7508A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 
is amended by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections (d) 
and (e), respectively, and by inserting after subsection (b) the 
following new subsection:
    ``(c) Special Rule for State-Declared Disasters.--
            ``(1) In general.--Upon the written request of the Governor 
        of a State (or the Mayor, in the case of the District of 
        Columbia) in which an emergency or disaster has been declared 
        under State law, subsection (a) shall apply to such State-
        declared emergency or disaster in the same manner as such 
        subsections apply to federally declared disasters.
            ``(2) State.--For purposes of this section, the term 
        `State' includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of 
        Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the 
        Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.''.
    (b) Mandatory Extensions Extended to 120 Days.--Section 7508A(e) of 
such Code, as redesignated by subsection (a), is amended--
            (1) by striking ``60 days'' in paragraph (1)(B) thereof and 
        inserting ``120 days'', and
            (2) by striking ``60-day'' in the heading and inserting 
        ``120-day''.
    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section shall 
apply to declarations made after the date of the enactment of this Act.

  To direct the Federal Communications Commission to establish a new 
   Tribal priority window for the 2.5 gigahertz band, and for other 
                               purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Extending Tribal Broadband Priority 
Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW 2.5 GHZ TRIBAL PRIORITY WINDOW.

    (a) Commission Defined.--In this section, the term ``Commission'' 
means the Federal Communications Commission.
    (b) New Tribal Priority Window.--The Commission shall--
            (1) not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, establish a new Tribal priority window for the 2.5 
        gigahertz band, under the same terms and conditions as the 
        Tribal priority window established in the Report and Order in 
        the matter of Transforming the 2.5 GHz Band adopted by the 
        Commission on July 10, 2019 (FCC 19-62), for any portions of 
        the band--
                    (A) that remain available for assignment in 
                accordance with that Report and Order; and
                    (B) for which the Commission did not receive an 
                application during the Tribal priority window 
                established in that Report and Order; and
            (2) accept applications in the new window established under 
        paragraph (1) during the period that--
                    (A) begins on the date on which the window is 
                established; and
                    (B) ends on the date that is 180 days after the 
                date on which the window is established, or such later 
                date as the Commission considers appropriate.
    (c) Exception From Certain Procedural Requirements.--To the extent 
that the Commission determines that section 553 of title 5, United 
States Code, chapter 6 of that title (commonly known as the 
``Regulatory Flexibility Act''), subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 
44, United States Code (commonly known as the ``Paperwork Reduction 
Act''), or any other provision of law would prevent the Commission from 
establishing the new Tribal priority window by the date required under 
paragraph (1) of subsection (b) or from beginning to accept 
applications in that window as required under paragraph (2)(A) of that 
subsection, that provision shall not apply to any action taken by the 
Commission, or any rule or order issued by the Commission, to establish 
that window or to begin accepting applications in that window (as the 
case may be).
                                 &lt;all&gt;

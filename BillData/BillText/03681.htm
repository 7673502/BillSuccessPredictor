            (1) study the short-term and long-term mechanisms that 
        cause sinkholes, including extreme storm events, prolonged 
        droughts causing shifts in water management practices, aquifer 
        depletion, and other major changes in water use; and
            (2) develop maps that depict zones that are at greater risk 
        of sinkhole formation.
    (b) Review of Maps.--Once during each 5-year period, or more often 
as the Director of the United States Geological Survey determines is 
necessary, the Director shall assess the need to revise and update the 
maps developed under this section.
    (c) Website.--The Director of the United States Geological Survey 
shall establish and maintain a public website that displays the maps 
developed under this section and other relevant information critical 
for use by community planners and emergency managers.

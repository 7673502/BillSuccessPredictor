    ``(z) Prompt Approval of Drugs When Safety Information Is Added to 
Labeling.--
            ``(1) General rule.--A drug for which an application has 
        been submitted or approved under subsection (b)(2) or (j) shall 
        not be considered ineligible for approval under this section or 
        misbranded under section 502 on the basis that the labeling of 
        the drug omits safety information, including contraindications, 
        warnings, precautions, dosing, administration, or other 
        information pertaining to safety, when the omitted safety 
        information is protected by exclusivity under clause (iii) or 
        (iv) of subsection (c)(3)(E), clause (iii) or (iv) of 
        subsection (j)(5)(F), or section 527(a), or by an extension of 
        such exclusivity under section 505A or 505E.
            ``(2) Labeling.--Notwithstanding clauses (iii) and (iv) of 
        subsection (c)(3)(E), clauses (iii) and (iv) of subsection 
        (j)(5)(F), or section 527, the Secretary shall require that the 
        labeling of a drug approved pursuant to an application 
        submitted under subsection (b)(2) or (j) that omits safety 
        information described in paragraph (1) include a statement of 
        any appropriate safety information that the Secretary considers 
        necessary to assure safe use.
            ``(3) Availability and scope of exclusivity.--This 
        subsection does not affect--
                    ``(A) the availability or scope of exclusivity or 
                an extension of exclusivity described in subparagraph 
                (A) or (B) of section 505A(o)(3);
                    ``(B) the question of the eligibility for approval 
                under this section of any application described in 
                subsection (b)(2) or (j) that omits any other aspect of 
                labeling protected by exclusivity under--
                            ``(i) clause (iii) or (iv) of subsection 
                        (c)(3)(E);
                            ``(ii) clause (iii) or (iv) of subsection 
                        (j)(5)(F); or
                            ``(iii) section 527(a); or
                    ``(C) except as expressly provided in paragraphs 
                (1) and (2), the operation of this section or section 
                527.''.

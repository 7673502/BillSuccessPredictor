    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This act may be cited as the ``Agricultural Fairs Rescue Act''.

SEC. 2. AGRICULTURAL FAIR RESCUE GRANTS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date on which 
funds are made available to carry out this section, the Secretary of 
Agriculture, acting through the Administrator of the Agricultural 
Marketing Service, shall award a grant to each State department of 
agriculture (or other appropriate State agency assigned with the 
promotion of agricultural fairs) for the purposes of providing support 
to eligible agricultural fairs for losses sustained by such fairs due 
to COVID-19.
    (b) Amount of Grant.--The amount of a grant to a State or State 
department of agriculture under this section shall be based on the 
difference between the average attendance at agricultural fairs in the 
State for a calendar year occurring during the 3-calendar-year period 
beginning with calendar year 2017 (or over a shorter period, if 
attendance data is not available for the entire 3-calendar-year period) 
compared to calendar year 2020.
    (c) Conditions.--As a condition on the receipt of a grant under 
this section, a State or State department of agriculture shall agree--
            (1) to prioritize supporting eligible agricultural fairs in 
        the State facing the greatest financial hardship; and
            (2) to use not more than 5 percent of grant funds for 
        administrative costs incurred in providing support to eligible 
        agricultural fairs.
    (d) Use of Funds.--A State or State department of agriculture 
selected to receive a grant under this section may only use grant funds 
to assist eligible agricultural fairs that--

        agribusiness in the State (as determined by the State);
            (2) have experienced a closure, stoppage, or cancellation

                    (B) any associated actions taken by any 
                governmental authority at the Federal, State, county, 
                or municipal level in response to that national 
                emergency;
            (3) agree to, and demonstrate the intent to, re-establish a 
        fair within 18 months of the termination of the declaration 
        specified in subsection (f)(2);
            (4) agree to use all grant funds within the 18-month period 
        that begins on the date on which such funds are received; and
            (5) agree to use funds received pursuant to this section 
        for operating capital expenses, to reimburse operating expenses 
        paid from reserves not originally intended for operating 
        expenses, repay indebtedness incurred to pay operating 
        expenses, or repay other third parties that contributed to 
        funding operating expenses, but not for capital improvements.

        national emergency, and the first fiscal year immediately 
        following the termination of such national emergency.
            (2) Administrative expenses.--Of the funds made available 
        under paragraph (1) to carry out this section for a fiscal 
        year, not more than 8 percent may be used for expenses related

        determined by the Secretary to be appropriate.

suicide or other priority characteristics, as determined by the 
Secretary.
    (g) Federal Share.--The Federal share of the cost of a project

        jumping;
            (2) the characteristics that distinguish structures

        jumping;
            (3) the types of nets or barriers that are effective at 
        reducing suicide-by-jumping with respect to the structures 
        identified under paragraph (1);
            (4) methods of reducing suicide-by-jumping with respect to 
        the structures identified under paragraph (1) other than nets

            (5) quantitative measures of the effectiveness of the nets 
        and barriers identified under paragraph (3);
            (6) quantitative measures of the effectiveness of the 
        additional methods identified under paragraph (4);
            (7) the entities that typically install the nets and

        paragraph (3).

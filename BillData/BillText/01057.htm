                                 An Act


 
To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration 
 of the National World War II Memorial in Washington, DC, and for other 
                                purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Greatest Generation Commemorative 
Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    The Congress finds the following:
        (1) The National World War II Memorial was dedicated in 
    Washington, DC, on May 29, 2004, and is located on the east end of 
    the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, opposite the Lincoln 
    Memorial and west of the Washington Monument.
        (2) The dedication of the National World War II Memorial was 
    the culmination of a 17-year effort that started on December 10, 
    1987 when the World War II Memorial Act was first introduced in the 
    House of Representatives, and was authorized by an Act of Congress 
    signed into law on May 25, 1993. Construction began September 4, 
    2001, after several years of fundraising and public hearings.
        (3) Opening to the public on April 29, 2004, the World War II 
    Memorial is the first national memorial dedicated to all who served 
    during World War II and acknowledges the commitment and achievement 
    of the entire Nation.
        (4) The Memorial honors the more than 16,000,000 who served in 
    the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II, the more 
    than 400,000 who died, and the millions who supported the war 
    effort from home.
        (5) It is a monument to the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment 
    of the American people to the common defense of the Nation and to 
    the broader causes of peace and freedom from tyranny throughout the 
    world.
        (6) Today, the Memorial is a top destination for millions of 
    annual visitors from all over the country and the world. For many 
    young visitors, their visit to the Memorial is a first glimpse to a 
    grateful Nation's remembrance of the sacrifices made by the World 
    War II generation.
        (7) For World War II veterans, the Memorial is a special 
    destination, a rendezvous point, and a gathering place for reunions 
    and commemoration programs.
        (8) The Friends of the National World War II Memorial play a 
    vital role in the preservation and maintenance of the National 
    World War II Memorial as a treasure for the American people, while 
    helping to facilitate key commemorative and educational programs at 
    the Memorial to pay tribute to America's ``Greatest Generation'' 
    and their efforts to preserve liberty for generations to come.
        (9) The National World War II Memorial stands as an important 
    symbol of America's national unity, a timeless reminder of the 
    moral strength and power that flows when free people are at once 
    united and bonded together in a common and just cause for liberty.

        wildlife.

applicant shall submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in 
such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may 
require, which shall include the following:
            (1) A description of the experience, qualifications, and 
        training (including planned training) of the applicant with

        management agency (or equivalent), a certification that the 
        applicant has consulted with such an agency (or equivalent).
            (3) In the case of an application submitted by an applicant 
        other than the owner of the property on which a relevant 
        proposed project will be located, a certification from such 
        owner that such owner--
                    (A) approves the project; and
                    (B) for the duration of the project, will only 
                allow the use of nonlethal coexistence measures on the 
                property for purposes of reducing property damage 
                caused by beavers (except in the case of a circumstance 
                subject to an exclusion under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i)).
    (c) Priority.--In awarding grants under the Program, the Secretary

              ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.

    (a) In General.--Except as provided in subsection (b), an agency 
shall offer for sale at fair market value a single, functional firearm, 
which would otherwise be destroyed, to an individual--
            (1) who is--
                    (A) a law enforcement officer employed by and in 
                good standing with such agency; or
                    (B) a former law enforcement officer separated from 
                the employ of such agency for reasons other than 
                misconduct, neglect of duty, or malfeasance; and
            (2) to whom such agency most recently issued such firearm.
    (b) Background Check Required.--
            (1) In general.--An agency may not sell a firearm to an 
        individual under subsection (a) of this section until the 
        national instant criminal background check system established 
        under section 103 of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act 
        (34 U.S.C. 40901) has notified the agency that receipt of a 
        firearm by the individual would not violate subsection (g) or 
        (n) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or State 
        law, unless paragraph (1) of section 922(t) of title 18, United 
        States Code, would not apply to the transfer by reason of 
        paragraph (3) of such section 922(t) if the agency were a 
        licensee.
            (2) Communication between a federal agency and nics.--For 
        the purpose of the sale of a firearm under subsection (a) of 
        this section, an agency may contact the national instant 
        criminal background check system in the same manner as a 
        licensee is authorized to contact the system under section 103 
        of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (34 U.S.C. 40901), 
        for information on whether receipt of a firearm by a 
        prospective buyer would violate section 922 of title 18, United 
        States Code, or State law, and the system may respond to such 
        contact as if the agency were a licensee.

                disciplinary action by the employing agency of such

    (a) In General.--Section 1894 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1395eee) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:

        any State may charge a Medicare-only PACE program eligible 
        individual (as defined in paragraph (4)(A)) who is enrolled in 
        such PACE program a monthly capitation payment amount for the

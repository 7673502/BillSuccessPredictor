NIST, acting through the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
program, shall maintain the National Supply Chain Database as an 
integration of the State level databases from each State's 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership Center and may be populated with

    (f) Exempt From Public Disclosure.--The National Supply Chain 
Database and any information related to it not publicly released by 
NIST shall be exempt from public disclosure under section 552 of title

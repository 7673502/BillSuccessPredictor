SEC. 3. STUDY ON ANIMAL CRUELTY, UNDERLYING FACTORS, AND FUTURE ACTS OF 
              HUMAN VIOLENCE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the 
National Institute of Justice, shall carry out a study--
            (1) on the underlying factors that contribute to acts of 
        animal cruelty committed by individuals; and
            (2) that analyzes acts of animal cruelty as a predictor of 
        future violence against humans.
    (b) Content of Study.--In carrying out the study under subsection 
(a), the Director of the National Institute of Justice shall--
            (1) specifically examine, through a review of scientific 
        literature, original research, and expert input, as 
        appropriate--
                    (A) evidence-informed risk factors associated or 
                correlated with individuals who commit acts of animal 
                cruelty;
                    (B) whether certain acts of animal cruelty can be 
                correlated with certain evidence-informed risk factors 
                (such as whether the acts of animal torturing, 
                tormenting, mutilation, maiming, poisoning, organized 
                abuse, such as animal fighting, sexual abuse, 
                abandonment, or neglect, are associated with the same 
                or different evidence-informed risk factors);
                    (C) whether certain acts of animal cruelty 
                demonstrate a tendency or likelihood to commit a future 
                act of violence against humans;
                    (D) the types of violence against humans most 
                commonly associated with certain acts of animal cruelty 
                (such as domestic violence and assault); and
                    (E) recommendations of areas in which future 
                research on animal cruelty is needed; and
            (2) develop best practices for--
                    (A) early interventions that prevent acts of animal 
                cruelty; and
                    (B) interventions with individuals who have 
                committed acts of animal cruelty to prevent future acts 
                of violence.
    (c) Recommendations.--The Director of the National Institute of 
Justice shall submit to Congress a report containing the specific 
policy recommendations, based on the study conducted under this 
section, for legislative and regulatory action at the Federal, State, 
and local levels to--
            (1) address the evidence-informed risk factors that may 
        contribute to acts of animal cruelty committed by individuals; 
        and
            (2) develop effective interventions and diversion 
        strategies for both juvenile and non-juvenile offenders who 
        have been convicted of criminal offenses involving animal 
        cruelty that reduce the likelihood of offenders committing 
        future violent acts against both humans and animals.

SEC. 4. STOP FUTURE VIOLENCE GRANT PROGRAM.

    (a) In General.--The Attorney General is authorized to establish a 
grant program to provide assistance to eligible entities to develop and 
strengthen effective detection strategies, and early intervention or 
diversion resources, to stop acts of animal cruelty and rehabilitate 
offenders.
    (b) Use of Funds.--A grant awarded under this section may be used 
to provide personnel, training, technical assistance, data collection, 
and other resources for the apprehension, prosecution, adjudication, 
and mental and behavioral health treatment of persons committing acts 
of animal cruelty, for the rehabilitation of perpetrators and the 
prevention of future acts of animal cruelty or violence against humans, 
and specifically, for the purposes of--
            (1) training law enforcement officers, judges, other court 
        personnel, prosecutors, and mental health professionals to more 
        effectively identify and respond to acts of animal cruelty;
            (2) developing, training, or expanding units of law 
        enforcement officers, judges, other court personnel, 
        prosecutors, and mental health professionals specifically 
        addressing acts of animal cruelty;
            (3) developing and implementing more effective police, 
        court, prosecution, mental health, and early intervention 
        policies, protocols, orders, and services specifically devoted 
        to preventing, identifying, and responding to acts of animal 
        cruelty; and
            (4) developing, installing, or expanding data collection 
        and communication systems, including computerized systems, 
        linking police, prosecutors, and courts, or for the purpose of 
        identifying, classifying, and tracking arrests, protection 
        orders, violations of protection orders, prosecutions, and 
        convictions for acts of animal cruelty.

SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    There are authorized to be appropriated--
            (1) for the purposes of carrying out section 3, $2,000,000

        for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The population of racial and ethnic minorities is 
        expected to increase over the next few decades, yet racial and 
        ethnic minorities have the poorest health status and face 
        substantial cultural, social, and economic barriers to 
        obtaining high-quality health care.
            (2) Health disparities are a function of not only access to 
        health care, but also the social determinants of health--
        including the environment, the physical structure of 
        communities, nutrition and food options, educational 
        attainment, employment, race, ethnicity, sex, geography, 
        language preference, immigrant or citizenship status, sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, or 
        disability status--that directly and indirectly affect the 
        health, health care, and wellness of individuals and 
        communities.
            (3) Over the next few decades, the United States will face 
        a shortage of health care providers and allied health workers.
            (4) All efforts to reduce health disparities and barriers 
        to high-quality health services require better and more 
        consistent data, and better and more consistent collection of 
        and access to data.
            (5) A full range of culturally and linguistically 
        appropriate health care and public health services must be 
        available and accessible in every community.
            (6) Racial and ethnic minorities and underserved 
        populations must be included early and equitably in health 
        reform innovations.
            (7) Efforts to improve minority health have been limited by 
        inadequate resources in funding, staffing, stewardship, and 
        accountability. Targeted investments that are focused on 
        disparities elimination must be made in providing care and 
        services that are community-based, including prevention and 
        policies addressing social determinants of health.
            (8) In 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services 
        developed the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic 
        Health Disparities and the National Stakeholder Strategy for 
        Achieving Health Equity, which are 2 strategic plans that 
        represent the first coordinated roadmap in the United States to 
        reducing health disparities. These comprehensive plans, along 
        with the National Prevention Strategy issued by the National 
        Prevention Council of the Department of Health and Human 
        Services, Healthy People 2030, and the National Quality 
        Strategy of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, as 
        well as critical resources such as the 2012 National Healthcare 
        Quality and Disparities Reports, will work to increase the 
        number of people in the United States who are healthy at every 
        stage of life.
            (9) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has also 
        reviewed and advanced updated clinical guidelines and developed 
        other strategic planning documents to combat health disparities 
        with a high impact on minority populations and to provide high-
        quality family planning services. Such guidelines and documents 
        include the National HIV/AIDS Strategy, the Action Plan for the 
        Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis, and 
        recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention and the Office of Population Affairs.
            (10) The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
        Law 111-148), as amended by the Health Care and Education 
        Reconciliation Act (Public Law 111-152), represents the biggest 
        advancement for minority health in the 40 years immediately 
        preceding the enactment of this Act.
            (11) The Health Information Technology for Educational and 
        Clinical Health Act of 2009, part of the American Recovery and 
        Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), provides that the 
        nationwide health information exchange infrastructure be 
        developed and used to reduce health disparities, among other 
        purposes.

 TITLE II--CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE HEALTH AND HEALTH 
                                  CARE

SEC. 2001. DEFINITIONS; FINDINGS.

    (a) Definitions.--In this title, the definitions in section 3400 of 
the Public Health Service Act, as added by section 2004, shall apply.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Effective communication is essential to meaningful 
        access to quality physical and mental health care.
            (2) Research indicates that the lack of appropriate 
        language services creates language barriers that result in 
        increased risk of misdiagnosis, ineffective treatment plans, 
        and poor health outcomes for individuals with limited English 
        proficiency and individuals with communication disabilities 
        such as cognitive, hearing, vision, or print impairments.
            (3) The number of limited English speaking residents in the 
        United States who speak English less than very well and, 
        therefore, cannot effectively communicate with health and 
        social service providers continues to increase significantly.
            (4) The responsibility to fund language services in the 
        provision of health care and health care-related services to 
        individuals with limited English proficiency and individuals 
        with communication disabilities such as cognitive hearing, 
        vision, or print impairments is a societal one that cannot 
        fairly be placed solely upon the health care, public health, or 
        social services community.
            (5) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
        2000d et seq.) prohibits discrimination based on the grounds of 
        race, color, or national origin by any entity receiving Federal 
        financial assistance. In order to avoid discrimination on the 
        grounds of national origin, all programs or activities 
        administered by the Federal Government must take adequate steps 
        to ensure that their policies and procedures do not deny or 
        have the effect of denying individuals with limited English 
        proficiency with equal access to benefits and services for 
        which such persons qualify.
            (6) Both the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
        U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
        U.S.C. 701 et seq.) prohibit discrimination on the basis of 
        disability and require the provision of appropriate auxiliary 
        aids and services necessary to ensure effective communication 
        with individuals with disabilities. The type of auxiliary aid 
        or service necessary to ensure effective communication will 
        vary in accordance with the method of communication used by the 
        individual; the nature, length, and complexity of the 
        communication involved; and the context in which the 
        communication is taking place. A public accommodation should 
        consult with individuals with disabilities whenever possible to 
        determine what type of auxiliary aid is needed to ensure 
        effective communication. The public accommodation should use 
        the individual's preferred method of communication whenever 
        possible, unless it would be an undue burden to the public 
        accommodation and an alternative would provide an equally 
        effective means of communication. The ultimate decision as to 
        what measures to take rests with the public accommodation, 
        provided that the method chosen results in effective 
        communication.
            (7) Section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable 
        Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18116) builds on title VI of the Civil 
        Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and section 504 of 
        the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), prohibits 
        discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
        disability, sex, and age, requires the provision of language 
        services to ensure effective communication with individuals 
        with limited English proficiency, and requires the provision of 
        appropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to ensure 
        effective communication with individuals with disabilities.
            (8) Linguistic diversity in the health care and health 
        care-related services workforce is important for providing all 
        patients the environment most conducive to positive health 
        outcomes.
            (9) All members of the health care and health care-related 
        services community should continue to educate their staff and 
        constituents about limited English proficient and disability 
        communication issues and help them identify resources to 
        improve access to quality care for individuals with limited 
        English proficiency and individuals with communication 
        disabilities such as cognitive, hearing, vision, or print 
        impairments.
            (10) Access to English as a second language, foreign 
        language, and sign language interpreters, translated and 
        alternative format documents, readers, and other auxiliary aids 
        and services, are essential to ensure effective communication 
        and eliminate the language barriers that impede access to 
        health care.
            (11) Culturally competent language services in health care 
        settings should be available as a matter of course.

SEC. 2002. IMPROVING ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED 
              ENGLISH PROFICIENCY.

    (a) Purpose.--Consistent with the goals provided in Executive Order

        services consistent with, and without substantially burdening, 
        the fundamental mission of the agency;
            (3) to require each Federal agency to translate any English 
        language written material prepared for the general public 
        relating to a public health emergency, including vaccine 
        distribution and education, into the top 15 non-English 
        languages in the United States (according to the most recent 
        data from the American Community Survey or its replacement) not 
        later than 7 days after any such material is made available in 
        English;
            (4) to require each Federal agency to ensure that 
        recipients of Federal financial assistance provide culturally 
        competent services and meaningful access to applicants and 
        beneficiaries who are individuals with limited English 
        proficiency;
            (5) to ensure that recipients of Federal financial 
        assistance take reasonable steps, consistent with the 
        guidelines set forth in the ``Guidance to Federal Financial 
        Assistance Recipients Regarding Title VI Prohibition Against 
        National Origin Discrimination Affecting Limited English 
        Proficient Persons (67 Fed. Reg. 41455 (June 18, 2002))'', to 
        ensure culturally and linguistically appropriate access to 
        their programs and activities by individuals with limited 
        English proficiency; and
            (6) to ensure compliance with title VI of the Civil Rights 
        Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.) and section 1557 of the 
        Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (42 U.S.C. 18116) 
        (prohibiting health care providers and organizations from 
        discriminating in the provision of services).

            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, each Federal agency providing financial

        plan to improve culturally and linguistically appropriate 
        access to such program or activity with respect to individuals 
        with limited English proficiency. Not later than 1 year after

                        that the data is accurate and shows a greater 
                        number of individuals with limited English

                    (C) Limitation on amount.--The amount of a grant

        term in section 92.4 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, 
        as in effect on May 18, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg. 31466); and

        given such term in section 92.4 of title 45, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, as in effect on May 18, 2016 (81 Fed. Reg. 31466).
    (b) Requirements.--A covered entity, in order to ensure the right 
of individuals with limited English proficiency to receive access to 
high-quality health care through the covered program or activity, 
shall--
            (1) ensure that appropriate clinical and support staff 
        receive ongoing education and training in culturally and 
        linguistically appropriate service delivery at least annually;
            (2) offer and provide appropriate language assistance 
        services at no additional charge to each patient that is an 
        individual with limited English proficiency at all points of 
        contact, in a timely manner during all hours of operation;
            (3) notify patients of their right to receive language 
        services in their primary language; and
            (4) utilize only qualified interpreters for an individual 
        with limited English proficiency or qualified translators, 
        except as provided in subsection (c).
    (c) Exemptions.--The requirements of subsection (b)(4) shall not 
apply as follows:
            (1) When a patient requests the use of family, friends, or 
        other persons untrained in interpretation or translation if 
        each of the following conditions are met:
                    (A) The interpreter requested by the patient is 
                over the age of 18.
                    (B) The covered entity informs the patient in the 
                primary language of the patient that he or she has the 
                option of having the entity provide to the patient an 
                interpreter and translation services without charge.
                    (C) The covered entity informs the patient that the 
                entity may not require an individual with a limited 
                English proficiency to use a family member or friend as 
                an interpreter.
                    (D) The covered entity evaluates whether the person 
                the patient wishes to use as an interpreter is 
                competent. If the covered entity has reason to believe 
                that such person is not competent as an interpreter, 
                the entity provides its own interpreter to protect the 
                covered entity from liability if the patient's 
                interpreter is later found not competent.
                    (E) If the covered entity has reason to believe 
                that there is a conflict of interest between the 
                interpreter and patient, the covered entity may not use 
                the patient's interpreter.
                    (F) The covered entity has the patient sign a 
                waiver, witnessed by at least 1 individual not related 
                to the patient, that includes the information stated in 
                subparagraphs (A) through (E) and is translated into 
                the patient's primary language.
            (2) When a medical emergency exists and the delay directly 
        associated with obtaining competent interpreter or translation 
        services would jeopardize the health of the patient, but only 
        until a competent interpreter or translation service is 
        available.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Subsection (c)(2) shall not be construed 
to mean that emergency rooms or similar entities that regularly provide 
health care services in medical emergencies are exempt from legal or 
regulatory requirements related to competent interpreter services.

        between primary care and specialists, by 2032.
            (2) Primarily due to the growing and aging population, over 
        the next decade, physician demand is expected to grow up to 17 
        percent.
            (3) The United States Census Bureau estimates that the 
        United States population will grow from 321,000,000 in 2015 to 
        347,000,000 in 2025. Further, the number of Medicare 
        beneficiaries is estimated to increase from 47,800,000 in 2015 
        to approximately 66,000,000 in 2025.
            (4) Approximately 36 percent of practicing physicians are 
        over the age of 55 and are likely to retire within the next 
        decade.
            (5) A nationwide physician shortage will result in many 
        individuals in the United States waiting longer and traveling 
        farther for health care; seeking nonemergent care in emergency 
        departments; and delaying treatment until the health care needs 
        of such individuals become more serious, complex, and costly.
            (6) Changing demographics (such as an aging population), 
        new health care delivery models (such as medical homes), and 
        other factors (such as disaster preparedness) are contributing 
        to a shortage of both generalist and specialist physicians.
            (7) These shortages will have the most severe impact on 
        vulnerable and underserved populations, including racial and 
        ethnic minorities and the approximately 20 percent of people in 
        the United States who live in rural or inner-city locations 
        designated as health professional shortage areas.
            (8) The health care utilization equity model of the 
        Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that if 
        racial and ethnic minorities and individuals from rural areas 
        utilized health care in a similar way to their Caucasian 
        counterparts living in metropolitan areas, the physician 
        shortage would require an additional 96,000 physicians.
            (9) To address the physician shortage in rural and 
        medically underserved areas, medical education and training 
        need to be accessible to underrepresented minorities (including 
        individuals who are African American, Hispanic, Native 
        American, or Native Hawaiian), and need to increase pathway 
        programs for such underrepresented minorities who make up less 
        than 12 percent of individuals enrolled in graduate medical 
        education and for international students who make up 25 percent 
        of individuals enrolled in graduate medical education. 
        Immigration pathways like student, exchange-visitor, and 
        employment visas, and programs like the National Interest 
        Waiver and Conrad 30 J-1 Visa Waiver, help improve health 
        access across the United States.
            (10) United States medical school enrollment was expected 
        to grow by 30 percent from 2018 to 2019 to help reduce the 
        shortage of quality physicians in the United States.
            (11) An increase in United States medical school graduates 
        must be accompanied by an increase of 4,000 graduate medical 
        education training positions each year.
            (12) Graduate medical education programs and teaching 
        hospitals provide venues in which the next generation of 
        physicians learns to work collaboratively with other physicians 
        and health professionals, adopt more efficient care delivery 
        models (such as care coordination and medical homes), 
        incorporate health information technology and electronic health 
        records in every aspect of their work, apply new methods of 
        assuring quality and safety, and participate in groundbreaking 
        clinical and public health research.
            (13) The Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) (having more 
        beneficiaries than any other health care program), supports its 
        ``fair share'' of the costs associated with graduate medical 
        education.
            (14) In general, the level of support of graduate medical 
        education by the Medicare program has been capped since 1997 
        and has not been increased to support the expansion of graduate 
        medical education programs needed to avert the projected 
        physician shortage or to accommodate the increase in United 
        States medical school graduates.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
eliminating the limit of the number of residency positions that receive 
some level of Medicare support under section 1886(h) of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(h)), also referred to as the Medical 
graduate medical education cap, is critical to--
            (1) ensuring an appropriate supply of physicians to meet 
        the health care needs in the United States;
            (2) facilitating equitable access for all who seek health 
        care;
            (3) increasing the racial and ethnic diversity of 
        physicians in the United States; and
            (4) mitigating disparities in health and health care.

SEC. 3014. CAREER SUPPORT FOR SKILLED, INTERNATIONALLY EDUCATED HEALTH 
              PROFESSIONALS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to a 2018 study, the State and local public 
        health workforce has shrunk by more than 50,000 individuals 
        since the beginning of the 2008 Great Recession, and almost one 
        quarter of individuals comprising the governmental public 
        health workforce plan to leave or retire in the coming years.
            (2) Shortages are projected for other health professions, 
        including within the fields of nursing (500,000 by 2025), 
        dentistry (15,000 by 2025), pharmacy (38,000 by 2030), mental 
        and behavioral health (236,880 by 2025), and primary care 
        (46,000 by 2025).
            (3) A nationwide health workforce shortage will result in 
        serious health threats and more severe and costly health care 
        needs, due to, in part, a delayed response to food-borne 
        outbreaks, emerging infectious diseases, natural disasters, 
        fewer cancer screenings, and delayed treatment.
            (4) Vulnerable and underserved populations and health 
        professional shortage areas will be most severely impacted by 
        the health workforce shortage.
            (5) According to the Migration Policy Institute, more than 
        2,000,000 college-educated immigrants in the United States 
        today are unemployed or underemployed in low- or semi-skilled 
        jobs that fail to draw on their education and expertise.
            (6) Approximately 2 out of every 5 internationally educated 
        immigrants are unemployed or underemployed.
            (7) According to the Drexel University Center for Labor 
        Markets and Policy, underemployment for internationally 
        educated immigrant women is 28 percent higher than for their 
        male counterparts.
            (8) According to the Drexel University Center for Labor 
        Markets and Policy, the mean annual earnings of underemployed 
        immigrants were $32,000, or 43 percent less than United States 
        born college graduates employed in the college labor market.
            (9) According to Upwardly Global and the Welcome Back 
        Initiative, with proper guidance and support, underemployed 
        skilled immigrants typically increase their income by 215 
        percent to 900 percent.
            (10) According to the Brookings Institution and the 
        Partnership for a New American Economy, immigrants working in 
        the health workforce are, on average, better educated than 
        United States-born workers in the health workforce.

            (3) Violation of agreements.--Section 214(l)(3)(A) of such 
        Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(l)(3)(A)) is amended by inserting 
        ``substantial requirement of an'' before ``agreement entered

            (4) Physician employment in underserved areas.--Section 
        214(l) of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(l)), as amended by this 
        section, is further amended by adding at the end the following:

SEC. 3017. NATIONAL HISPANIC NURSES DAY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) A special group of nurses in the Nation are the 
        Hispanic nurses.
            (2) Hispanic nurses provide culturally and ethnically 
        competent care and are educated to be sensitive to regional and 
        community customs of persons needing care.
            (3) Hispanic nurses are well-positioned to provide 
        leadership to eliminate health care disparities that exist in 
        the Nation.
            (4) Since 1975, the National Association of Hispanic Nurses 
        (NAHN) has represented Hispanic nurses (RNs/LPNs) in the United 
        States and is the only nursing organization for Hispanic nurses 
        whose mission is to advance the health in Hispanic communities 
        and to lead, promote, and advocate for educational, 
        professional, and leadership opportunities for Hispanic nurses.
            (5) Since September is the month that has been set aside to 
        honor the contributions of Hispanics, it is only fitting that 
        Hispanic nurses be recognized and honored during this time for 
        their outstanding contributions to their community and country.
            (6) The designation of an observation day will help to 
        raise awareness of the accomplishments of Hispanic nurses and 
        pave the way for the important work that they must continue to 
        carry out.
            (7) Each February, the NAHN convenes nearly 100 nursing 
        leaders from academia, research, education, and practice in the 
        District of Columbia for a day on Capitol Hill promoting 
        legislation that improves the health of Hispanic communities.
            (8) Hispanic nurses are strong allies to Congress as they 
        help inform, educate, and work closely with legislators to 
        improve the education, retention, recruitment, and practice of 
        all nurses and, more importantly, the health and safety of the 
        patients they care for.
            (9) Hispanic nurses add needed diversity to the nursing 
        profession, and these nurses have engaged in numerous ways to 
        support communities and the needs of an overlooked, under 
        resourced, and underserved population being severely impacted 
        by COVID-19.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals, and the designation, of 
        National Hispanic Nurses Day, as proposed by the National 
        Association of Hispanic Nurses;
            (2) recognizes the significant contributions of Hispanic 
        nurses to the health care system of the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Hispanic Nurses Day with appropriate recognition, 
        ceremonies, activities, and programs to demonstrate the 
        importance of Hispanic nurses to the everyday lives of patients 
        and the communities they serve.

                    (B) Comparative performance target.--The Secretary 
                shall establish for the agency a comparative 
                performance target equal to the average total payments

                comparable individuals in the same geographic area that 
                are not determined to be within the scope of the pilot 
                project.
            (2) Incentive.--Subject to paragraph (3), the Secretary 
        shall pay to each participating home care agency an incentive 
        payment for each year under the pilot project equal to a 
        portion of the Medicare savings realized for such year relative 
        to the performance target under paragraph (1).
            (3) Limitation on expenditures.--The Secretary shall limit 
        incentive payments under this section in order to ensure that 
        the aggregate expenditures under title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) (including incentive 
        payments under this subsection) do not exceed the amount that 
        the Secretary estimates would have been expended if the pilot 
        projects under this section had not been implemented.
    (d) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary may waive such provisions of 
titles XI and XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.;

for the conduct of the pilot projects under this section.
    (e) Report to Congress.--Not later than 5 years after the date that 
the first pilot project under this section is implemented, the 
Secretary shall submit to Congress a report on the pilot projects. Such 
report shall contain a detailed description of issues related to the 
expansion of the projects under subsection (f) and recommendations for 
such legislation and administrative actions as the Secretary considers 
appropriate.
    (f) Expansion.--If the Secretary determines that any of the pilot 
projects under this section enhance health outcomes for Medicare 
beneficiaries and reduce expenditures under title XVIII of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.), the Secretary may initiate 
comparable projects in additional areas.
    (g) Incentive Payments Have No Effect on Other Medicare Payments to 
Agencies.--An incentive payment under this section--
            (1) shall be in addition to the payments that a home health 
        agency would otherwise receive under title XVIII of the Social 
        Security Act for the provision of home health services; and
            (2) shall have no effect on the amount of such payments.

                requirements established for charitable hospital 
                organizations under section 501(r) of the Internal 
                Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to community health

``SEC. 340G-2. ORAL HEALTH LITERACY AND AWARENESS.

Subtitle D--Advancing Health Equity Through Payment and Delivery Reform

SEC. 4301. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the sustainability of the health care system in the 
        United States hinges on restructuring how health care is paid 
        for, shifting away from paying for the volume of services 
        provided to the value the services provide;
            (2) high value care is care that provides higher quality 
        care more efficiently, achieving greater health improvement and 
        better health outcomes at lower cost (per patient and overall);
            (3) a high value health care system must deliver timely, 
        accessible, well-coordinated, high-quality, culturally 
        centered, and language-appropriate care to everyone;
            (4) eliminating health and health care disparities and 
        achieving health equity must be central to and required in 
        efforts to achieve a high value health care system;
            (5) eliminating such disparities and achieving such equity 
        will require tailored interventions and targeted investments to 
        address inequities in health and health care to make sure that 
        health care delivery and payment efforts are responsive to and 
        inclusive of the needs of communities of color and other 
        communities experiencing disparities; and
            (6) new models of value-based payment and care delivery 
        should prioritize primary care and consider the holistic needs 
        of and other factors with respect to the patient population, 
        including with respect to behavioral health, oral health, end-
        of-life care, history of adverse childhood experiences and 
        adverse community environments, social determinants of health, 
        social risk factors, unmet social needs, and the burden of 
        intergenerational racial and other inequities.

SEC. 4302. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES REPORTING AND 
              VALUE-BASED PROGRAMS.

    (a) Advancing Health Equity in Reporting and Value-Based Payment 
Programs.--
            (1) In general.--The Administrator of the Centers for 
        Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this section referred to as 
        the ``Administrator'') shall require that a clinician or other 
        professional participating in any pay-for-reporting or value-
        based payment program stratify clinical quality measures by 
        disparity variables, including race, ethnicity, sex, primary 
        language, disability status, sexual orientation, gender 
        identity, and socioeconomic status. A clinician or other 
        professional may use existing demographic data collection 
        fields in certified electronic health record technology (as 
        defined in section 1848(o)(4) of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1395w-4(o)(4))) to carry out such data stratification 
        under the preceding sentence. Such stratified data will assist 
        clinicians and other professionals in the identification of 
        disparities obscured in aggregated data and assist with the 
        provision of interventions that target reducing those 
        disparities.
            (2) Clinician.--In assessing performance in any value-based 
        payment program, the Administrator shall incorporate a 
        clinician or other professional's performance in reducing 
        disparities across race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, 
        disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and 
        socioeconomic status. Linking performance payments to the 
        reduction of health care disparities across such variables will 
        assist in holding clinicians and other professionals 
        accountable for providing quality care that can lead to 
        decreased health inequities.
            (3) Requirement of adoption of cert.--All entities, 
        clinicians, or other professionals participating in the Quality 
        Payment Program of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
        shall be required to adopt 2015 certified electronic health 
        record technology (as so defined) as a condition of 
        participating in such program.
    (b) Quality Improvement Activities.--The Administrator, upon yearly 
review of the Quality Payment Program, shall add quality improvement 
activities that implement the Culturally and Linguistically Accessible 
Standards (CLAS) as Improvement Activities under the Quality Payment 
Program.

SEC. 4303. DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF DISPARITY REDUCING DELIVERY AND 
              PAYMENT MODELS.

    (a) In General.--The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation 
established under section 1115A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1315a) (in this section referred to as the ``CMI'') shall establish a 
dedicated fund to identify, test, evaluate, and scale delivery and 
payment models under the applicable titles (as defined in subsection 
(a)(4)(B) of such section) that target health disparities among racial 
and ethnic minorities, including models that support high-value 
nonmedical services that address socially determined barriers to health 
in all stages of the life cycle through end-of-life, including English 
proficiency status, low health and health care literacy, lack of access 
to health care planning, including end-of-life care planning, case 
management, transportation, enrollment assistance needs, stable and 
affordable housing, utility assistance, employment and career 
development, and nutrition and food security which will help to reduce 
disparities and impact the overall cost of care.
    (b) Amendment to Social Security Act.--The second sentence of 
section 1115A(a)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a(a)(1)) 
is amended by inserting ``and improve health equity'' after 
``expenditures''.
    (c) Pilot Programs.--The CMI shall prioritize the testing of models 
under such section 1115A that include partnerships with entities, 
including community based organizations or other nonprofit entities, to 
help address socially determined barriers to health and health care.
    (d) Alternatives.--Any model tested by the CMI under such 1115A 
shall include measures to assess and track the impact of the model on 
health disparities, using existing measures such as the Healthcare 
Disparities and Cultural Competency Measures endorsed by the entity 
with a contract under section 1890(a) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395aaa(a)), and stratified by race, ethnicity, English 
proficiency, gender identity, sexual orientation, and disability 
status.

SEC. 4304. DIVERSITY IN CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID CONSULTATION.

    (a) In General.--In carrying out the duties under this section, the 
CMI shall consult representatives of relevant Federal agencies, and 
clinical and analytical experts with expertise in medicine and health 
care management, specifically such experts with expertise in--
            (1) the health care needs of minority, rural, and 
        underserved populations; and
            (2) the financial needs of safety net, community based, 
        rural, and critical access providers, including federally 
        qualified health centers.
    (b) Open Door Forums.--The CMI shall use open door forums or other 
mechanisms to seek external feedback from interested parties and 
incorporate that feedback into the development of models.

SEC. 4305. SUPPORTING SAFETY NET AND COMMUNITY-BASED PROVIDERS TO 
              COMPETE IN VALUE-BASED PAYMENT SYSTEMS.

    (a) In General.--Any pay-for-performance or alternative payment 
model that is developed and tested by the Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Innovation established under section 1115A of the Social 
Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a), or any other agency of the Department 
of Health and Human Services with respect to the programs under titles

               Subtitle F--Equitable Health Care For All

SEC. 4501. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said ``Of all the 
        forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most 
        shocking and inhuman because it often results in physical 
        death.''.
            (2) Inequity in health care remains a persistent and 
        devastating reality for many communities, and, in particular, 
        communities of color.
            (3) The provision of inequitable health care has complex 
        causes, many stemming from systemic inequality in access to 
        health care, housing, nutrition, economic opportunity, 
        education, and other factors.
            (4) Health care outcomes for Black communities in 
        particular lag far behind those of the population as a whole.
            (5) Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute 
        of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on April 7, 2020, the 
        coronavirus outbreak is ``shining a bright light'' on 
        ``unacceptable'' health disparities in the Black community.
            (6) A contributing factor in health disparities is explicit 
        and implicit bias in the delivery of health care, resulting in 
        inferior care and poorer outcomes for some patients on the 
        basis of factors that include race, national origin, sex 
        (including sexual orientation or gender identity), disability, 
        age, and religion.
            (7) The National Academy of Medicine (formerly known as the 
        ``Institute of Medicine'') issued a report in 2002 titled 
        ``Unequal Treatment'', finding that racial and ethnic 
        minorities receive lower-quality health care than Whites do, 
        even when insurance status, income, age, and severity of 
        condition is comparable.
            (8) Just as Congress has sought to eliminate bias, both 
        explicit and implicit, in employment, housing, and other parts 
        of our society, the elimination of bias and the legacy of 
        structural racism in health care is of paramount importance.

SEC. 4502. DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.

    (a) Required Reporting.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services, in consultation with the Director for Civil Rights

        Health, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & 
        Medicaid Services, the Director of the Agency for Healthcare 
        Research and Quality, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for 
        Minority Health, and the Director of the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention, shall by regulation require all health 
        care providers and facilities that are required under other 
        provisions of law to report data on specific health outcomes to 
        the Department of Health and Human Services in aggregate form, 
        to disaggregate such data by demographic characteristics, 
        including by race, national origin, sex (including sexual 
        orientation and gender identity), disability, and age, as well 
        as any other factor that the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services determines would be useful for determining a pattern 
        of provision of inequitable health care.
            (2) Proposed regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the 
        date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services shall issue proposed regulations to carry out 
        paragraph (1).
    (b) Repository.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--
            (1) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
        this Act, establish a repository of the disaggregated data 
        reported pursuant to subsection (a);
            (2) subject to paragraph (3), make the data in such 
        repository publicly available; and
            (3) ensure that such repository does not contain any data 
        that is individually identifiable.

2024, in expanding the number of measures under subclause (III), the 
Secretary shall adopt measures that relate to equitable health care 
furnished by hospitals in inpatient settings.
    ``(bb) In carrying out this subclause, the Secretary shall solicit 
input and recommendations from individuals and groups representing 
communities of color and other protected classes and ensure measures 
adopted pursuant to this subclause account for social determinants of 
health, as defined in section 7(e)(10) of the Equal Health Care for All 
Act.
    ``(cc) For purposes of this subclause, the term `equitable health 
care' refers to the principle that high-quality care should be provided 
to all individuals and health care treatment and services should not 
vary on account of the real or perceived race, national origin, sex 
(including sexual orientation and gender identity), disability, or age 
of an individual, as well as any other factor that the Secretary 
determines would be useful for determining a pattern of provision of 
inequitable health care.''.
    (b) Inclusion of Equitable Health Care Measures.--Section 
1886(o)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(o)(2)(B)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following new clause:
                            ``(iv) Inclusion of equitable health care 
                        measures.--Beginning in fiscal year 2024, 
                        measures selected under subparagraph (A) shall 
                        include the equitable health care measures 
                        described in subsection 
                        (b)(3)(B)(viii)(XIII).''.

SEC. 4504. PROVISION OF INEQUITABLE HEALTH CARE AS A BASIS FOR 
              PERMISSIVE EXCLUSION FROM MEDICARE AND STATE HEALTH CARE 
              PROGRAMS.

    Section 1128(b) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320a-7(b)) 
is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
            ``(18) Provision of inequitable health care.--
                    ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), any 
                health care provider that the Secretary determines has 
                engaged in a pattern of providing inequitable health 
                care (as defined in section 7(e)(7) of the Equal Health 
                Care for All Act) on the basis of race, national

                identity), disability, or age of an individual.
                    ``(B) Exception.--For purposes of carrying out 
                subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall not exclude any 
                health care provider from participation in the Medicare 
                program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act or 
                the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act if the 
                exclusion of such health care provider would result in 
                increased difficulty in access to health care services 
                for underserved or low-income communities.''.

                                within 180 days (unless it is 
                                impracticable to complete such 
                                investigation within 180 days) after 
                                the filing of the complaint.
                    (B) Investigations.--

                        investigating the complaint, the Director may 
                        seek records of care provided to patients other 
                        than the complainant if necessary to 
                        demonstrate or disprove an allegation of 
                        inequitable provision of health care or to 
                        determine whether there is a pattern or 
                        practice of such care.
                            (ii) Accounting for social determinants of 
                        health.--In investigating the complaint and 
                        reaching a determination on the validity of the 
                        complaint, the Director shall account for 
                        social determinants of health and the effect of 
                        such social determinants on health care 
                        outcomes.
                            (iii) Inability to complete 
                        investigation.--If the Director is unable to

                        complete) the investigation within 180 days 
                        after the filing of the complaint (or, if the 
                        Secretary takes further action under paragraph 
                        (6)(B) with respect to a complaint, within 180 
                        days after the commencement of such further 
                        action), the Director shall notify the 
                        complainant and respondent in writing of the 
                        reasons involved.

                        authorities.--On concluding each investigation 
                        under this subparagraph, the Director shall 
                        provide to the State licensing authorities that 
                        were notified under subparagraph (A), 
                        information specifying the results of the 
                        investigation.

                        investigation under this paragraph, the 
                        Director shall prepare a final investigative 
                        report.
                            (ii) Modification of report.--A final 
                        report under this subparagraph may be modified 
                        if additional evidence is later discovered.
            (3) Conciliation.--
                    (A) In general.--During the period beginning on the 
                date on which a complaint is filed under this 
                subsection and ending on the date of final disposition 
                of such complaint (including during an investigation 
                under paragraph (2)(B)), the Director shall, to the 
                extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to 
                such complaint.
                    (B) Conciliation agreement.--A conciliation 
                agreement arising out of such conciliation shall be an 
                agreement between the respondent and the complainant, 
                and shall be subject to approval by the Director.
                    (C) Rights protected.--The Director shall approve a 
                conciliation agreement only if the agreement protects 
                the rights of the complainant and other persons 
                similarly situated.
                    (D) Publicly available agreement.--
                            (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), 
                        the Secretary shall make available to the 
                        public a copy of a conciliation agreement 
                        entered into pursuant to this subsection unless 
                        the complainant and respondent otherwise agree, 
                        and the Secretary determines, that disclosure 
                        is not required to further the purposes of this 
                        subsection.
                            (ii) Limitation.--A conciliation agreement 
                        that is made available to the public pursuant 
                        to clause (i) may not disclose individually 
                        identifiable health information.
            (4) Failure to comply with conciliation agreement.--
        Whenever the Director has reasonable cause to believe that a 
        respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the Director 
        shall refer the matter to the Attorney General to consider 
        filing a civil action to enforce such agreement.
            (5) Written consent for disclosure of information.--Nothing 
        said or done in the course of conciliation under this 
        subsection may be made public, or used as evidence in a 
        subsequent proceeding under this subsection, without the 
        written consent of the parties to the conciliation.
            (6) Prompt judicial action.--
                    (A) In general.--If the Director determines at any 
                time following the filing of a complaint under this 
                subsection that prompt judicial action is necessary to 
                carry out the purposes of this subsection, the Director 
                may recommend that the Attorney General promptly 
                commence a civil action under subsection (d).
                    (B) Immediate suit.--If the Director determines at 
                any time following the filing of a complaint under this 
                subsection that the public interest would be served by 
                allowing the complainant to bring a civil action under 
                subsection (c) in a State or Federal court immediately, 
                the Director shall certify that the administrative 
                process has concluded and that the complainant may file 
                such a suit immediately.
            (7) Annual report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Director 
        shall make publicly available a report detailing the activities 
        of the Office for Civil Rights and Health Equity under this 
        subsection, including--

                which the complaints were filed;

                result of such complaints; and

                        alleged violation of subsection (a), or for 
                        breach of a conciliation agreement under 
                        subsection (b), in an appropriate district 
                        court of the United States or State court--
                                    (I) not sooner than the earliest 
                                of--

                                        conciliation agreement is 
                                        reached under subsection (b);
                                            (bb) the date of a final

                                            (cc) 180 days after the 
                                        first day of the alleged 
                                        violation; and
                                    (II) not later than 2 years after 
                                the final day of the alleged violation.
                            (ii) Statute of limitations.--The 
                        computation of such 2-year period shall not 
                        include any time during which an administrative 
                        proceeding (including investigation or 
                        conciliation) under subsection (b) was pending 
                        with respect to a complaint under such 
                        subsection.
                    (B) Barring suit.--If the Director has obtained a 
                conciliation agreement under subsection (b) regarding

                be filed under this paragraph by the complainant 
                involved with respect to the alleged violation except 
                for the purpose of enforcing the terms of such an 
                agreement.
            (2) Relief which may be granted.--
                    (A) In general.--In a civil action under paragraph 
                (1), if the court finds that a violation of subsection 
                (a) or breach of a conciliation agreement has occurred, 
                the court may award to the plaintiff actual and 
                punitive damages, and may grant as relief, as the court 
                determines to be appropriate, any permanent or 
                temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or 
                other order (including an order enjoining the defendant 
                from engaging in a practice violating subsection (a) or 
                ordering such affirmative action as may be 
                appropriate).
                    (B) Fees and costs.--In a civil action under 
                paragraph (1), the court, in its discretion, may allow 
                the prevailing party, other than the United States, a 
                reasonable attorney's fee and costs. The United States 
                shall be liable for such fees and costs to the same 
                extent as a private person.
            (3) Intervention by attorney general.--Upon timely 
        application, the Attorney General may intervene in a civil 
        action under paragraph (1), if the Attorney General certifies 
        that the case is of general public importance.
    (d) Enforcement by the Attorney General.--
            (1) Commencement of actions.--
                    (A) Pattern or practice cases.--The Attorney 
                General may commence a civil action in any appropriate 
                district court of the United States if the Attorney 
                General has reasonable cause to believe that any health 
                care provider covered by subsection (a)--
                            (i) is engaged in a pattern or practice 
                        that violates such subsection; or
                            (ii) is engaged in a violation of such 
                        subsection that raises an issue of significant 
                        public importance.
                    (B) Cases by referral.--The Director may determine, 
                based on a pattern of complaints, a pattern of 
                violations, a review of data reported by a health care 
                provider covered by subsection (a), or any other means, 
                that there is reasonable cause to believe a health care 
                provider is engaged in a pattern or practice that 
                violates subsection (a). If the Director makes such a 
                determination, the Director shall refer the related 
                findings to the Attorney General. If the Attorney 
                General finds that such reasonable cause exists, the 
                Attorney General may commence a civil action in any 
                appropriate district court of the United States.
            (2) Enforcement of subpoenas.--The Attorney General, on 
        behalf of the Director, or another party at whose request a 
        subpoena is issued under this subsection, may enforce such 
        subpoena in appropriate proceedings in the district court of 
        the United States for the district in which the person to whom 
        the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts 
        business.
            (3) Relief which may be granted in civil actions.--
                    (A) In general.--In a civil action under paragraph 
                (1), the court--
                            (i) may award such preventive relief, 
                        including a permanent or temporary injunction, 
                        temporary restraining order, or other order 
                        against the person responsible for a violation 
                        of subsection (a) as is necessary to assure the 
                        full enjoyment of the rights granted by this 
                        subsection;
                            (ii) may award such other relief as the 
                        court determines to be appropriate, including 
                        monetary damages, to aggrieved persons; and
                            (iii) may, to vindicate the public 
                        interest, assess punitive damages against the 
                        respondent--
                                    (I) in an amount not exceeding 
                                $500,000, for a first violation; and
                                    (II) in an amount not exceeding 
                                $1,000,000, for any subsequent 
                                violation.
                    (B) Fees and costs.--In a civil action under this 
                subsection, the court, in its discretion, may allow the 
                prevailing party, other than the United States, a 
                reasonable attorney's fee and costs. The United States

                        not have a maternal mortality review committee;
                            (vi) whether maternal mortality review 
                        committees include multidisciplinary and

                        review committees participate in trainings on 
                        bias, racism, or discrimination, and the 
                        quality of such trainings;
                            (viii) the extent to which States have 
                        implemented systematic processes of listening 
                        to the stories of pregnant and postpartum 
                        individuals and their family members, with a

                        review committees are considering social 
                        determinants of maternal health when examining 
                        the causes of pregnancy-associated and 
                        pregnancy-related deaths;
                            (x) the extent to which maternal mortality 
                        review committees are making actionable 
                        recommendations based on their reviews of 
                        adverse maternal health outcomes and the extent 
                        to which such recommendations are being

                        and reporting processes in separating 
                        pregnancy-associated deaths from pregnancy-
                        related deaths; and

                    (B) Whether the funding support referred to in 
                subparagraph (A)(xiii) is adequate for States to carry 
                out optimal data collection and dissemination processes 
                with respect to maternal health, maternal mortality, 
                and severe maternal morbidity.

                        for research purposes that could be tested, 
                        refined, and submitted for national 
                        endorsement;
                            (v) barriers preventing maternity care 
                        providers and insurers from implementing

                        measures established by the National Committee 
                        for Quality Assurance;

                        quality measures account for the unique 
                        experiences of pregnant and postpartum 
                        individuals from racial and ethnic minority 
                        groups (as such term is defined in section 
                        1707(g)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42

                        quality measures.
                    (D) Recommendations on authorizing additional funds 
                and providing additional technical assistance to 
                improve maternal mortality review committees and State 
                and Tribal maternal health data collection and 
                reporting processes.
                    (E) Recommendations for new authorities that may be 
                granted to maternal mortality review committees to be 
                able to--
                            (i) access records from other Federal and 
                        State agencies and departments that may be 
                        necessary to identify causes of pregnancy-
                        associated and pregnancy-related deaths that 
                        are unique to pregnant and postpartum 
                        individuals from specific populations, such as 
                        veterans and individuals who are incarcerated;

                        members of the maternal mortality review 
                        committee to assist in the review of pregnancy-
                        associated deaths of pregnant and postpartum 
                        individuals from specific populations, such as 
                        veterans and individuals who are incarcerated.
                    (F) Recommendations to improve and standardize 
                current quality measures for maternity care, with a 
                particular focus on racial and ethnic inequities in 
                maternal health outcomes.
                    (G) Recommendations to improve the coordination by 
                the Department of Health and Human Services of the 
                efforts undertaken by the agencies and organizations

               Subtitle E--Reproductive and Sexual Health

SEC. 5401. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON URGENT BARRIERS TO ABORTION 
              ACCESS AND VITAL SOLUTIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Affordable, comprehensive health insurance that 
        includes coverage for a full range of pregnancy-related care, 
        including abortion, is critical to the health of every person 
        regardless of actual or perceived race, color, national origin, 
        immigration status, sex (including sexual orientation, gender 
        identity, pregnancy, childbirth, a medical condition relating 
        to pregnancy or childbirth, or sex stereotyping), age, or 
        disability status.
            (2) Abortion services are essential to health care and 
        access to those services is central to people's ability to 
        participate equally in the economic and social life of the 
        United States. Abortion access allows people who are pregnant 
        to make their own decisions about their pregnancies, their 
        families, and their lives.
            (3) Reproductive justice seeks to address restrictions on 
        reproductive health, including abortion, that perpetuate 
        systems of oppression, lack of bodily autonomy, White 
        supremacy, and anti-Black racism. The violent legacy of these 
        systems of oppression has manifested in policies including 
        enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black people, forced 
        sterilizations, medical experimentation on low-income people's 
        reproductive systems, and the forcible removal of Indigenous 
        children. Access to equitable reproductive health care, 
        including abortion services, has always been deficient in the 
        United States for Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color 
        (BIPOC) and their families. Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-
        expansive individuals, and specifically those who are Black, 
        disabled, and at the intersections of multiple forms of 
        oppression, also experience inequitable access to abortion 
        services due to systemic violence. Centering abortion rights 
        and access as a ``women's health'' issue restricts access to 
        those with reproductive needs who do not identify as cisgender 
        women. In order to work towards reproductive justice for all 
        communities, transgender, nonbinary, and gender expansive must 
        be centered in conversations of abortion access. Improving 
        abortion access for this community requires a gender-neutral 
        approach to abortion care, rights, and justice policy.
            (4) The legacy of restrictions on reproductive health, 
        rights, and justice is not a dated vestige of a dark history. 
        Access to abortion services is obstructed across the United 
        States in various ways, including blockades of health care 
        facilities and associated violence, prohibitions of, and 
        restrictions on, insurance coverage, parental involvement laws 
        (notification and consent), restrictions that shame and 
        stigmatize people seeking abortion services, and medically 
        unnecessary regulations that neither confer any health benefit 
        nor further the safety of abortion services, but which harm 
        people by delaying, complicating access to, and reducing the 
        availability of, abortion services. As of December 2, 2021, 19 
        States have enacted 106 restrictions, including 12 new abortion 
        bans, making 2021 the year with the highest number of 
        restrictions passed since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. 
        Additionally, 21 States are poised to immediately ban or 
        significantly restrict access to abortion services if the 
        Supreme Court chooses to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade. These 
        unprecedented attacks on abortion rights and access fall 
        especially heavily on people with low incomes, BIPOC, 
        immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, those 
        living in rural and other medically underserved areas, and 
        transgender, nonbinary, and gender expansive individuals.
            (5) Since 1976, the Federal Government has withheld funds 
        for abortion coverage in most circumstances through the Hyde 
        amendment and similar coverage restrictions, affecting 
        individuals of reproductive age in the United States who are 
        insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals 
        who receive insurance or care through other Federal health 
        plans and programs. Of women aged 15 to 44 enrolled in Medicaid 
        in 2017, 55 percent lived in the 35 States and the District of 
        Columbia that do not cover abortion, except in limited 
        circumstances. This amounts to roughly 7,300,000 women of 
        reproductive age, including 3,100,000 women living below the 
        Federal poverty level. Women of color are disproportionately 
        likely to be insured by the Medicaid program, and nationwide, 
        32 percent of Black women and 27 percent of Hispanic women aged 
        15 to 44 were enrolled in Medicaid in 2017, compared with 16 
        percent of White women.
            (6) Abortion-specific restrictions are even more compounded 
        by the ongoing criminalization of people who are pregnant, 
        including those who are incarcerated, living with HIV, or with 
        substance-use disorders. These communities already experience 
        health inequities due to social, political, and environmental 
        inequities, and restrictions on abortion services exacerbate 
        these harms. Removing medically unjustified restrictions on 
        abortion services would constitute one important step on the 
        path toward realizing reproductive justice by ensuring that the 
        full range of reproductive health care is accessible to all who 
        need it.
            (7) Abortion-specific restrictions are a tool of gender 
        oppression, as they target health care services that are used 
        primarily by individuals with reproductive needs. These 
        paternalistic restrictions rely on and reinforce harmful 
        stereotypes about gender roles, people's decision making, and 
        people's need for protection instead of support, undermining 
        their ability to control their own lives and well-being. These 
        restrictions harm the basic autonomy, dignity, and equality of 
        individuals with reproductive health needs, and their ability 
        to participate in the social and economic life of the Nation.
            (8) Many abortion-specific restrictions do not confer any 
        health or safety benefits on the patient. Instead, these 
        restrictions have the purpose and effect of unduly burdening 
        people's personal and private medical decisions to end their 
        pregnancies by making access to abortion services more 
        difficult, invasive, and costly, often forcing people to travel 
        significant distances and make multiple unnecessary visits to 
        the provider, and in some cases, foreclosing the option 
        altogether.
            (9) Congress has used its authority in the past to protect 
        access to abortion services and health care providers' ability 
        to provide abortion services. In the early 1990s, protests and 
        blockades at health care facilities where abortion services 
        were provided, and associated violence, increased dramatically 
        and reached crisis level, requiring congressional action. 
        Congress passed the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act 
        (Public Law 103-259; 108 Stat. 694) to address that situation 
        and protect physical access to abortion services.
            (10) Congressional action is necessary to put an end to 
        harmful restrictions, to federally protect access to abortion 
        services for everyone regardless of where they live, and to 
        protect the ability of health care providers to provide these 
        services in a safe and accessible manner.
            (11) The Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health 
        Insurance Act of 2021 or the EACH Act of 2021 (H.R. 2234, S. 
        1021) introduced in the 117th Congress, would reverse the Hyde 
        amendment and related abortion coverage restrictions. It would 
        create an enforceable statutory right for people who receive 
        health coverage or care through enumerated Federal programs 
        (including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, 
        Medicare, the Indian Health Service, among others) and plans 
        (including government-sponsored health insurance due to a 
        current or former employment relationship) to receive abortion 
        coverage. It would require the Federal government to facilitate 
        abortion access for individuals eligible to receive health care 
        in Federal facilities or in facilitates with which it contracts 
        to provide health care, such as immigration detention centers. 
        It also prohibits the Federal Government from prohibiting, 
        restricting, or otherwise inhibiting State or local governments 
        or private health insurance issuers from providing abortion 
        coverage.
            (12) The Women's Health Protection Act of 2021 (H.R. 3755, 
        S. 1975) introduced in the 117th Congress, would establish an 
        enforceable statutory right for health care providers to 
        provide, and abortion patients to receive, abortions free from 
        medically unnecessary restrictions, limitations, and bans that 
        delay, and at times, completely obstruct, access to abortion.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that 
eliminating the Hyde amendment, enacting the Equal Access to Abortion 
Coverage in Health Insurance Act of 2021, and enacting the Women's 
Health Protection Act of 2021, are critical to--
            (1) promoting equitable abortion access, including 
        coverage, for all who seek care;
            (2) creating enforceable rights to receive, and receive 
        coverage for, such care;
            (3) advancing equitable access to comprehensive health 
        coverage, which cannot be achieved without abortion coverage; 
        and
            (4) alleviating urgent racial, gender, and other inequities 
        in health and health care and corresponding reproductive 
        injustices.

            (1) Despite the existence of effective treatments, 
        inequities lie in the availability, accessibility, and quality 
        of mental health services for racial and ethnic minorities and 
        people with disabilities.
            (2) These inequities have powerful significance for 
        minority groups and for society as a whole.
            (3) Racial and ethnic minorities bear a greater burden from 
        unmet mental health needs and thus suffer a greater loss to 
        their overall health and productivity.
            (4) Improving community conditions and one's home 
        environment, paired with high-quality, accessible, and 
        culturally and linguistically tailored mental health services, 
        can reduce the likelihood, frequency, and intensity of 
        challenges to one's mental health.
            (5) The presence of strong social connections and trust, 
        opportunities to experience and share cultural identity, safe 
        gathering places, and economic opportunity are community 
        factors that benefit mental health.
            (6) The social, physical, economic, and other conditions, 
        otherwise known as social determinants of health, in 
        communities can have tremendous influence on daily stressors 
        that shape mental health outcomes.
            (7) Significant barriers include the cost of and access to 
        quality care, societal stigma, mental health workforce 
        shortages, the fragmented organization of services and needed 
        social supports, and the history of racism and discrimination 
        in the mental health system.
            (8) People with severe and persistent mental illness who 
        are racial or ethnic minorities often have co-occurring health 
        and mental health conditions and experience direct inequities 
        in access to necessary supports, resources, and services which, 
        without proper accommodations and support, further stigmatize 
        them and limit their participation in society.
            (9) African-American, Latinx, Asian American, Pacific 
        Islander, Native, Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), and 
        other people of color communities are more likely to experience 
        systemic discrimination by health care and social service 
        providers and may be reluctant to seek mental health care and 
        other health interventions.
            (10) Mental health conditions and substance abuse disorders 
        retain considerable stigma in many communities of color and 
        seeking treatment is not always encouraged.
            (11) Addressing mental health stigma and increasing access 
        to culturally and linguistically appropriate treatments and 
        supports in communities will help to increase utilization of 
        mental health services for people who have functional 
        difficulties because of mental health challenges.
            (12) There is a link between a mental health diagnosis and 
        the likelihood of an individual committing suicide.
            (13) A comprehensive public health approach to behavioral 
        health is one that fosters and finances protective factors in 
        racial and ethnic communities that support mental health.
            (14) Approaches to mental health and trauma must keep in 
        mind the historical and present day and cultural trauma that 
        impacts many communities of color, including trauma and loss 
        caused by adverse weather events and structural violence.
            (15) Culturally and linguistically appropriate treatments 
        and supports must keep approaches of individual communities to 
        mental health in mind, including by considering--
                    (A) approaches to cultural healing practices; and
                    (B) the diverse mental health professionals needed 
                for such practices, such as peer support specialists.
            (16) Approaches to mental health and addressing trauma must 
        keep in mind the concept of intersectionality of individuals; 
        that individuals may experience many inequities that shape the 
        way they process and experience everyday life.

SEC. 6002. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that it is imperative that a 
comprehensive public health approach to addressing trauma and mental 
health care be focused on care delivery that is culturally and 
linguistically appropriate.

        on the impact of telehealth on health care access, utilization, 
        cost, and outcomes, broken down by race, ethnicity, sex, age, 
        disability status, and zip code. Such report shall--

                alignment among such policies to promote access to 
                telehealth across all States, State Medicaid plans 
                under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.

          TITLE VII--ADDRESSING HIGH IMPACT MINORITY DISEASES

                           Subtitle A--Cancer

SEC. 7001. LUNG CANCER MORTALITY REDUCTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for 
        both men and women, accounting for 25 percent of all cancer 
        deaths.
            (2) Since the National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-
        218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and comprehensive research has 
        raised the 5-year survival rates for breast cancer to 90 
        percent, for prostate cancer to 99 percent, and for colon 
        cancer to 64 percent.
            (3) The 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is still only 
        18 percent, and a similar coordinated and comprehensive 
        research effort is required to achieve increases in lung cancer 
        survivability rates.
            (4) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed in 
        nonsmokers or former smokers.
            (5) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are 
        women.
            (6) Certain minority populations, such as African-American 
        males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer 
        incidence and mortality, despite their smoking rate being 
        similar to other racial groups.
            (7) Members of the Baby Boomer Generation are entering 
        their 60s, the most common age at which people develop lung 
        cancer.
            (8) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer 
        carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and 
        battlefield emissions are serious problems among military 
        personnel and war veterans.
            (9) Significant and rapid improvements in lung cancer 
        mortality can be expected through greater use and access to 
        lung cancer screening tests for at-risk individuals.
            (10) Recent research has shown that screening with low-dose 
        computed tomography scan reduced lung cancer death mortality by 
        20 percent for those with a high risk of lung cancer through 
        early detection. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services 
        supports annual lung cancer screening for high-risk patients 
        with low-dose computed tomography.
            (11) Additional strategies are necessary to further enhance 
        the existing tests and therapies available to diagnose and 
        treat lung cancer in the future.
            (12) The August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress 
        Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that 
        funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels 
        characterized for other common malignancies and far out of 
        proportion to its massive health impact''.
            (13) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group 
        identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of 
        integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research 
        consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer rather 
        than around specific research disciplines.
            (14) The United States must enhance its response to the 
        issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review 
        Group, and this can be accomplished through the establishment 
        of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the lung cancer 
        mortality rate by 50 percent by 2020 and targeted funding to 
        support this coordinated effort.
    (b) Sense of Congress Concerning Investment in Lung Cancer 
Research.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a 
        national public health priority; and
            (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated 
        by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified and 
        necessary to adequately address and reduce lung cancer 
        mortality.
    (c) Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program.--
            (1) In general.--Subpart 1 of part C of title IV of the 
        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended by

SEC. 7002. EXPANDING PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH, OUTREACH, SCREENING, 
              TESTING, ACCESS, AND TREATMENT EFFECTIVENESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer 
        death among men.
            (2) In 2020, an estimated 191,930 individuals in the United 
        States will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and approximately 
        33,330 will die from the disease.
            (3) Roughly 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 people in the United 
        States are living with a diagnosis of prostate cancer and its 
        consequences.
            (4) Although prostate cancer generally affects older 
        individuals, younger men are also at risk for the disease, and 
        when prostate cancer appears in early middle age, it frequently 
        takes on a more aggressive form.
            (5) There are significant racial and ethnic disparities 
        that demand attention, for example, African Americans have 
        prostate cancer mortality rates that are more than double those 
        in the White population.
            (6) Underserved rural populations have higher rates of 
        mortality compared to their urban counterparts, and innovative 
        and cost-efficient methods to improve rural access to high-
        quality care should take advantage of advances in telehealth to 
        diagnose and treat prostate cancer when appropriate.
            (7) Certain populations of veterans may have nearly twice 
        the incidence of prostate cancer as the general population of 
        the United States.
            (8) Urologists may constitute the specialists who diagnose 
        and treat the vast majority of prostate cancer patients.
            (9) Although much basic and translational research has been 
        completed and much is currently known, there are still many 
        unanswered questions, such as the extent to which known 
        disparities are attributable to disease etiology, access to 
        care, or education and awareness in the community.
            (10) Causes of prostate cancer are not known. There is not 
        good information regarding how to differentiate accurately, 
        early on, between aggressive and indolent forms of the disease. 
        As a result, there is significant overtreatment in prostate 
        cancer. There are no treatments that can durably arrest growth 
        or cure prostate cancer once it has metastasized.
            (11) A significant proportion of cases may be clinically 
        indolent and ``overdiagnosed'', resulting in significant 
        overtreatment. More accurate tests will allow men and their 
        families to face less physical, psychological, financial, and 
        emotional trauma, and billions of dollars could be saved in 
        private and public health care systems.
            (12) Prostate cancer research and health care programs 
        across Federal agencies should be coordinated to improve 
        accountability and actively encourage the translation of 
        research into practice and to identify and implement best 
        practices in order to foster an integrated and consistent focus 
        on effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the 
        disease.
    (b) Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education.--
            (1) Interagency prostate cancer coordination and education 
        task force.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in 
        cooperation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
        Health and Human Services, shall establish an Interagency 
        Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force (in this 
        section referred to as the ``Prostate Cancer Task Force'').
            (2) Duties.--The Prostate Cancer Task Force shall--
                    (A) develop a summary of advances in prostate 
                cancer research supported or conducted by Federal 
                agencies relevant to the diagnosis, prevention, and 
                treatment of prostate cancer, including psychosocial 
                impairments related to prostate cancer treatment, and 
                compile a list of best practices that warrant broader 
                adoption in health care programs;
                    (B) consider establishing, and advocating for, a 
                guidance to enable physicians to allow screening of men 
                who are age 74 or older, on a case-by-case basis, 
                taking into account quality of life and family history 
                of prostate cancer;
                    (C) share and coordinate information on research 
                and health care program activities by the Federal 
                Government, including activities related to--
                            (i) determining how to improve research and 
                        health care programs, including psychosocial 
                        impairments related to prostate cancer 
                        treatment;
                            (ii) identifying any gaps in the overall

                            (iii) identifying opportunities to promote 
                        translation of research into practice; and
                            (iv) maximizing the effects of Federal 
                        Government efforts by identifying opportunities 
                        for collaboration and leveraging of resources 
                        in research and health care programs that serve 
                        individuals who are susceptible to or diagnosed 
                        with prostate cancer;
                    (D) develop a comprehensive interagency strategy

                multidisciplinary research and health care programs, 
                including proposals to evaluate factors that may be 
                related to the etiology of prostate cancer, that 
                would--
                            (i) result in innovative approaches to 
                        study emerging scientific opportunities or

SEC. 7003. PROSTATE RESEARCH, IMAGING, AND MEN'S EDUCATION (PRIME).

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Prostate cancer has reached epidemic proportions, 
        particularly among African-American men, and strikes and kills 
        men in numbers comparable to the number of women who lose their 
        lives from breast cancer.
            (2) Life-saving breakthroughs in screening, diagnosis, and 
        treatment of breast cancer resulted from the development of 
        advanced imaging technologies led by the Federal Government.
            (3) Men should have accurate and affordable prostate cancer 
        screening exams and minimally invasive treatment tools, similar 
        to what women have for breast cancer.
            (4) While it is important for men to take advantage of 
        current prostate cancer screening techniques, a recent NCI-
        funded study demonstrated that the most common available 
        methods of detecting prostate cancer (PSA blood test and 
        physical exams) are not foolproof, causing numerous false 
        alarms and false reassurances.
            (5) The absence of advanced imaging technologies for 
        prostate cancer causes the lack of accurate information 
        critical for clinical decisions, resulting in missed cancers 
        and lost lives, as well as unnecessary and costly medical 
        procedures, with related complications.
            (6) With prostate imaging tools, men and their families 
        would face less physical, psychological, financial, and 
        emotional trauma and billions of dollars could be saved in 
        private and public health care systems.

SEC. 7008. REDUCING CANCER DISPARITIES WITHIN MEDICARE.

    (a) Development of Measures of Disparities in Quality of Cancer 
Care.--
            (1) Development of measures.--The Secretary of Health and 
        Human Services (in this section referred to as the 
        ``Secretary'') shall enter into an agreement with an entity 
        that specializes in developing quality measures for cancer care 
        under which the entity shall develop a uniform set of measures 
        to evaluate disparities in the quality of cancer care and 
        annually update such set of measures.
            (2) Measures to be included.--Such set of measures shall 
        include, with respect to the treatment of cancer, measures of 
        patient outcomes, the process for delivering medical care 
        related to such treatment, patient counseling and engagement in 
        decision-making, patient experience of care, resource use, and 
        practice capabilities, such as care coordination.
    (b) Establishment of Reporting Process.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a reporting 
        process that requires and provides for a method for health care 
        providers specified under paragraph (2) to submit to the 
        Secretary and make public data on the performance of such 
        providers during each reporting period through use of the 
        measures developed pursuant to subsection (a). Such data shall 
        be submitted in a form and manner and at a time specified by 
        the Secretary.
            (2) Specification of providers to report on measures.--The 
        Secretary shall specify the classes of Medicare providers of 
        services and suppliers, including hospitals, cancer centers, 
        physicians, primary care providers, and specialty providers, 
        that will be required under such process to publicly report on 
        the measures specified under subsection (a).
            (3) Assessment of changes.--Under such reporting process, 
        the Secretary shall establish a format that assesses changes in 
        both the absolute and relative disparities in cancer care over 
        time. These measures shall be presented in an easily 
        comprehensible format, such as those presented in the final 
        publications relating to Healthy People 2010 or the National 
        Healthcare Disparities Report.
            (4) Initial implementation.--The Secretary shall implement 
        the reporting process under this subsection for reporting 
        periods beginning not later than 6 months after the date that 
        measures are first established under subsection (a).

  Subtitle B--Viral Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention

SEC. 7051. VIRAL HEPATITIS AND LIVER CANCER CONTROL AND PREVENTION.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Viral 
Hepatitis and Liver Cancer Control and Prevention Act of 2022''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) In the United States, nearly 5,000,000 persons are 
        living with the hepatitis B virus (referred to in this section 
        as ``HBV'') or the hepatitis C virus (referred to in this 
        section as ``HCV'').
            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        (referred to in this section as the ``CDC''), has recognized 
        HCV as the Nation's most common chronic bloodborne virus 
        infection and HBV as the deadliest vaccine-preventable disease.
            (3) HBV is transmitted through contact with infectious 
        blood, semen, or other bodily fluids and is 100 times more 
        infectious than HIV. HCV is transmitted by contact with 
        infectious blood, particularly through percutaneous exposures 
        (such as puncture through the skin).
            (4) In the United States, chronic HBV and HCV are the most 
        common causes of liver cancer, the second deadliest and fastest 
        growing cancer in this country. These viruses are the most 
        common cause of chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and the 
        most common indications for liver transplantation. In 2019, 
        nearly 16,000 deaths per year in the United States were 
        attributed to chronic HBV and HCV. Chronic HCV is also a 
        leading cause of death in Americans living with HIV/AIDS, many 
        of those living with HIV/AIDS are coinfected with chronic HBV, 
        chronic HCV, or both.
            (5) The CDC estimates that in 2019, 57,500 people in the 
        United States were newly infected with HCV and 20,700 people in 
        the United States were newly infected with HBV. These estimates 
        could be much higher due to many reasons, including lack of 
        screening education and awareness, and perceived 
        marginalization of the populations at risk.
            (6) The CDC reported a 374 percent increase in hepatitis C 
        cases from 2010 to 2017, stemming from the opioid, heroin, and 
        overdose epidemics affecting communities nationwide. From 2014 
        to 2015, the number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B 
        infection in the United States rose for the first time since 
        2006, increasing by 20.7 percent, which is also largely 
        attributable to the opioid epidemic.
            (7) HBV and HCV disproportionately affect certain 
        populations in the United States. Although representing only 
        about 6 percent of the population, Asian Americans and Pacific 
        Islanders account for half of all chronic HBV cases in the 
        United States. Baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965) 
        account for approximately 75 percent of domestic chronic HCV 
        cases. In addition, African Americans, Latinos, and American 
        Indian and Native Alaskans are among the groups which have 
        disproportionately high rates of HBV or HCV infections in the 
        United States.
            (8) Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death among 
        the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. Asian and 
        Pacific Islander men and women are more than twice as likely to 
        develop liver cancer compared to the non-Hispanic White 
        population. The higher incidence rate of liver cancer is 
        partially explained by higher incidence rates of hepatitis B 
        and diabetes, which are comorbidities shown to increase an 
        individual's risk of developing liver cancer.
            (9) Chronic HBV and chronic HCV usually do not cause 
        symptoms early in the course of the disease, but after many 
        years of a clinically ``silent'' phase, CDC estimates show more 
        than 33 percent of infected individuals will develop cirrhosis, 
        end-stage liver disease, or liver cancer. Since most 
        individuals with chronic HBV, HCV, or both are unaware of their 
        infection, they do not know to take precautions to prevent the 
        spread of their infection and can unknowingly exacerbate their 
        own disease progression. For those chronically infected with 
        HBV or HCV, regular monitoring can lead to the early detection 
        of liver cancer at a stage where a treatment is still possible.
            (10) For both chronic HBV and chronic HCV, behavioral 
        changes and appropriate medical care can slow disease 
        progression if diagnosis is made early. Early diagnosis, which 
        is determined through simple blood tests, can reduce the risk 
        of transmission and disease progression through education and 
        vaccination of household members and other susceptible persons 
        at risk.
            (11) Treatment for chronic HCV can eradicate the disease in 
        approximately 90 percent of those currently treated. While 
        there is no cure for chronic HBV, available treatments can 
        effectively suppress viral replication in the overwhelming 
        majority of those treated, thereby reducing the risk of 
        transmission and progression to liver scarring or liver cancer.
            (12) The annual health care costs attributable to HBV and 
        HCV in the United States are significant. For HBV, it is 
        estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per 
        infected person). In 2000, the lifetime cost of HBV, before the 
        availability of most current therapies, was approximately 
        $80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling more than 
        $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical costs for patients are 
        expected to increase from $30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over 
        $85,000,000,000 in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and 
        diagnosing individuals earlier, and connecting them to 
        appropriate treatment and care, will save lives and critical 
        health care dollars. Currently, without a comprehensive 
        screening, testing, and diagnosis program, most patients are 
        diagnosed too late when they need a liver transplant costing at 
        least $314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have liver 
        cancer or end-stage liver disease which costs $30,980 to 
        $110,576 per hospital admission. As health care costs continue 
        to grow, it is critical that the Federal Government invests in 
        effective mechanisms to avoid documented cost drivers.
            (13) In 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services 
        released its ``Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan: A 
        Roadmap for Elimination for the United States, 2021-2025'' 
        (referred to in this section as the ``HHS Strategic Plan''). In 
        March 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, 
        and Medicine released a report entitled, ``A National Strategy 
        for the Elimination of Hepatitis B and C: Phase Two Report'' 
        (referred to in this section as the ``NAS report''), 
        recommending specific actions to eliminate viral hepatitis as 
        public health problems in the United States by 2030.
            (14) According to the NAS report, chronic HBV and HCV 
        infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality despite 
        being preventable and treatable. Deficiencies in the 
        implementation of established guidelines for the prevention, 
        diagnosis, and medical management of chronic HBV and HCV 
        infections perpetuate personal and economic burdens. Existing 
        grants are not sufficient for the scale of the health burden 
        presented by HBV and HCV.
            (15) Screening and testing for HBV and HCV is aligned with 
        the goals of Healthy People 2030 to increase immunization 
        rates, reduce rates of infectious diseases, and improve health 
        for people with chronic infections. Awareness of disease and 
        access to prevention and treatment remain essential components 
        for reducing infectious disease transmission.
            (16) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and 
        awareness of HBV and HCV and to assist State and local 
        prevention and control efforts in reducing the morbidity and 
        mortality of these epidemics.
            (17) The Secretary of Health and Human Services has the 
        discretion to carry out this section (including the amendments 
        made by this section) directly and through whichever of the 
        agencies of the Public Health Service the Secretary determines 
        to be appropriate, which may (in the Secretary's discretion) 
        include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
        Health Resources and Services Administration, the Substance 
        Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the National 
        Institutes of Health (including the National Institute on 
        Minority Health and Health Disparities), and other agencies of 
        such Service.

Prevention, Education, Research, and Medical Management Plan.--Title 
III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is further 
amended--
            (1) by striking section 317N (42 U.S.C. 247b-15); and

           Subtitle C--Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Diseases

SEC. 7101. ACQUIRED BONE MARROW FAILURE DISEASES.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Bone Marrow 
Failure Disease Research and Treatment Act of 2020''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Between 20,000 and 30,000 people in the United States 
        are diagnosed each year with myelodysplastic syndromes, 
        aplastic anemia, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, and other 
        acquired bone marrow failure diseases.
            (2) Acquired bone marrow failure diseases have a 
        debilitating and often fatal impact on those diagnosed with 
        these diseases.
            (3) While some treatments for acquired bone marrow failure 
        diseases can prolong and improve the quality of patients' 
        lives, there is no single cure for these diseases.
            (4) The prevalence of acquired bone marrow failure diseases 
        in the United States will continue to grow as the general 
        public ages.
            (5) Evidence exists suggesting that acquired bone marrow 
        failure diseases occur more often in minority populations, 
        particularly in Asian-American and Latino or Hispanic 
        populations.
            (6) The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the 
        National Cancer Institute have conducted important research 
        into the causes of and treatments for acquired bone marrow 
        failure diseases.
            (7) The National Marrow Donor Program Registry has made 
        significant contributions to the fight against bone marrow 
        failure diseases by connecting millions of potential marrow 
        donors with individuals and families suffering from these 
        conditions.
            (8) Despite these advances, a more comprehensive Federal 
        strategic effort among numerous Federal agencies is needed to 
        discover a cure for acquired bone marrow failure disorders.
            (9) Greater Federal surveillance of acquired bone marrow 
        failure diseases is needed to gain a better understanding of 
        the causes of acquired bone marrow failure diseases.
            (10) The Federal Government should increase its research 
        support for and engage with public and private organizations in 
        developing a comprehensive approach to combat and cure acquired 
        bone marrow failure diseases.
    (c) National Acquired Bone Marrow Failure Disease Registry.--Title 
III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended 
by inserting after section 317U (42 U.S.C. 247b-23) the following:

                                as nutrition, physical activity, 
                                epidemiology, communications, and 
                                policy implementation, and 
                                collaboration between public health 
                                officials and community-based

                          Subtitle E--HIV/AIDS

SEC. 7201. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to achieve an AIDS-free 
generation, and to--
            (1) expand access to lifesaving antiretroviral therapy for 
        people living with HIV and immediately link people to 
        continuous and coordinated high-quality care when they learn 
        they are living with HIV;
            (2) expand targeted efforts to prevent HIV infection using 
        a combination of effective, evidence-based approaches, 
        including routine HIV screening, and universal access to HIV 
        prevention tools, including preexposure prophylaxis, in 
        communities disproportionately impacted by HIV, particularly 
        communities of color;
            (3) ensure laws, policies, and regulations do not impede 
        access to prevention, treatment, and care for people living 
        with HIV or disproportionately impacted by HIV;
            (4) accelerate research for more efficacious HIV prevention 
        and treatments tools, a cure, and a vaccine; and
            (5) respect the human rights and dignity of persons living 
        with HIV.

SEC. 7202. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Over 1,100,000 people are estimated to be living with 
        HIV in the United States according to the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention, 14 percent of whom are unaware they are 
        living with HIV.
            (2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
        estimates that, in 2019, there were approximately 34,800 people 
        newly diagnosed with HIV. New HIV infections declined 8 percent 
        from 37,800 in 2015, after a period of general stability. From 
        2015 to 2019, new infections among young gay and bisexual men 
        (ages 13 to 24) dropped 33 percent overall, with declines in 
        young men of all races, but African Americans, Hispanics, and 
        Latinos continue to be severely and disproportionately 
        affected.
            (3) HIV disproportionately affects certain populations in 
        the United States. Though Blacks/African Americans represent 
        approximately 13 percent of the population, they account for 
        almost half (44 percent) of all people living with HIV in the 
        United States. Black/African-American men who have sex with men 
        account for 26 percent of all new HIV infections and have 
        remained stable from 2010 to 2019.
            (4) Disparities continue to exist among Latinos and 
        Hispanics; in 2019, Latinos and Hispanics made up 18 percent of 
        the United States population and 30 percent of new infections.
            (5) Though the rate of new infections among American 
        Indians and Alaska Natives (referred to in this section as 
        ``AI/AN'') is proportional to their population size, from 2015 
        to 2019, the annual number of HIV diagnoses increased among 
        American Indians and Alaska Natives.
            (6) Asian Americans account for about 2 percent of new HIV 
        infections, but in 2013, 22 percent were undiagnosed, the 
        highest rate of undiagnosed HIV among any race or ethnicity. 
        Between 2010 and 2016, the number of Asian Americans receiving 
        an HIV diagnosis increased by 42 percent.
            (7) The latest data from the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention indicates that new infections among women 
        remained stable for women in 2019.
            (8) The history of HIV shows that culturally relevant and 
        gender-responsive supportive services, including psychosocial 
        support, treatment literacy, case management, and 
        transportation are necessary strategies to reach and engage 
        women and girls in medical care.
            (9) From 2015 through 2019 in the United States and 6 
        dependent areas, the number of diagnoses of HIV infection for 
        transgender adults and adolescents increased. In 2019, among 
        transgender adults and adolescents, the largest percentage (93 
        percent) of diagnoses of HIV infections was for transgender 
        male-to-female (MTF) people. By age, in 2019, the largest 
        percentage (24 percent) of diagnoses of HIV infection among 
        transgender persons was for transgender MTF adults and 
        adolescents aged 20 to 24 years, followed by transgender MTF 
        adults and adolescents aged 25 to 29 years (23 percent).
            (10) Stigma and discrimination contribute to such 
        disparities.
            (11) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
        determined that increasing the proportion of people who know 
        their HIV status is an essential component of comprehensive HIV 
        treatment and prevention efforts and that early diagnosis is 
        critical in order for people with HIV to receive life-extending 
        therapy. Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention recommend routine HIV screening in health care 
        settings for all patients aged 13 to 64, regardless of risk.
            (12) In 1998, Congress created the National Minority AIDS 
        Initiative to provide technical assistance, build capacity, and 
        strengthen outreach efforts among local institutions and 
        community-based organizations that serve racial and ethnic 
        minorities living with or vulnerable to HIV.
            (13) To combat the HIV epidemic in the United States, the 
        National HIV/AIDS Strategy (referred to in this section as 
        ``NHAS'') provides a framework of increasing access to care, 
        reducing new infections, and eliminating HIV-related health 
        disparities. The vision of NHAS is ``The United States will be 
        a place where new HIV infections are prevented, every person 
        knows their status, and every person with HIV has high-quality 
        care and treatment, lives free from stigma and discrimination, 
        and can achieve their full potential for health and well-being 
        across the lifespan. This vision includes all people, 
        regardless of age, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, 
        race, ethnicity, religion, disability, geographic location, or 
        socioeconomic circumstance.''.
            (14) In January 2019, the Department of Health and Human 
        Services began implementing the initiative ``Ending the HIV 
        Epidemic: A Plan for America''. The initiative seeks to reduce 
        the number of new HIV infections in the United States by 75 
        percent by 2025, and then by at least 90 percent by 2030, for 
        an estimated 250,000 total HIV infection averted.
            (15) At present, many States and United States territories 
        have criminal statutes based on ``exposure'' to HIV. Most of 
        these laws were adopted before the availability of effective 
        antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS.
            (16) Research shows that stable housing leads to better 
        health outcomes for those living with HIV. Inadequate or 
        unstable housing is not only a barrier to effective treatment, 
        but also increases the likelihood of engaging in risky 
        behaviors leading to HIV infection. Insecure housing puts 
        people with HIV/AIDS at risk of premature death from exposure 
        to other diseases, poor nutrition, and lack of medical care.
            (17) Due to advances in treatment, many people living with 
        HIV today are living healthy lives and have the ability and 
        desire to fully participate in all aspects of community life, 
        including employment. Research associates being employed with 
        tremendous economic, social, and health benefits for many 
        people living with HIV.
            (18) Despite the tremendous progress made in the treatment 
        and prevention of HIV/AIDS, discriminatory policies stemming 
        from continued stigmatization of HIV/AIDS and the LGBTQ+ 
        community continue to plague the scientific community. This 
        includes blood donation guidance updated by Food and Drug 
        Administration in 2020 that recommends a 3-month deferral 
        policy for gay and bisexual men before they are eligible to 
        donate blood. Health agencies in the United States must 
        implement blood donation policies that are grounded in science 
        and that do not unfairly single out any group of individuals.
            (19) The common benefits associated with employment include 
        income, autonomy, productivity, and status within society, 
        daily structure, making a contribution to one's community, and 
        increased skills and self-esteem. Research also indicates that 
        many people with disabilities, including people living with 
        HIV, report perceiving themselves as being less disabled or not 
        disabled at all, when working. Furthermore, some studies link 
        working with better physical and mental health outcomes for 
        people living with HIV when compared to those who are not 
        working. Preliminary data also suggest that transitioning to 
        employment is associated with reduced HIV-related health risk 
        behavior for many people.
            (20) In July 2012, the Food and Drug Administration 
        approved the first drug to be used as pre-exposure prophylaxis 
        (PrEP). PrEP reduces the risk of HIV infection in HIV-negative 
        individuals. Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV 
        transmission from sex by about 99 percent when taken 
        consistently. Despite increases in PrEP uptake, PrEP use 
        remains low among gay and bisexual men of color. The Centers 
        for Disease Control and Prevention found that uptake was lower 
        among African-American (26 percent) and Latino (30 percent) men 
        compared with White men (42 percent). Similarly, PrEP awareness 
        was lower among African-American (86 percent) and Latino (87 
        percent) men compared with White men (95 percent). While 
        clinical research on transgender populations and PrEP is 
        currently limited, the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention recommends PrEP use in transgender populations. In 
        September 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved the 
        second drug to be used as PrEP.
            (21) Syringe service programs have been associated with 
        lowered HIV infections, lower hepatitis C infections, and 
        increased linkage to substance use treatment.
            (22) There is now conclusive scientific evidence that a 
        person living with HIV who is on antiretroviral therapy and is 
        durably virally suppressed (defined as having a consistent 
        viral load of less than 200 copies/ml) does not sexually 
        transmit HIV. The conclusive evidence about the highly 
        effective preventative benefits of antiretroviral therapy 
        provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve the lives of 
        people living with HIV, improve treatment uptake and adherence, 
        and advocate for expanded access to treatment and care.

SEC. 7203. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR AIDS DRUG ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
              TREATMENTS.

    Section 2623 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300ff-31b) 
is amended by adding at the end the following:

appropriated for carrying out this subpart, there are authorized to be 
appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out sections 
2612(b)(3)(B) and 2616 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2026.''.

SEC. 7204. ENHANCING THE NATIONAL HIV SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.

    (a) Grants.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting 
through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
shall make grants to States to support integration of public health 
surveillance systems into all electronic health records in order to 
allow rapid communications between the clinical setting and health 
departments, by means that include--
            (1) providing technical assistance and policy guidance to 
        State and local health departments, clinical providers, and 
        other agencies serving individuals with HIV to improve the 
        interoperability of data systems relevant to monitoring HIV 
        care and supportive services;
            (2) capturing longitudinal data pertaining to the 
        initiation and ongoing prescription or dispensing of 
        antiretroviral therapy for individuals diagnosed with HIV (such 
        as through pharmacy-based reporting);

            (3) to urge members of their communities to reduce risk 
        factors, practice safe sex and other preventive measures, be 
        tested for HIV, and seek care when appropriate.

SEC. 7215. REVIEW OF ALL FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS, POLICIES, AND 
              REGULATIONS REGARDING THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF 
              INDIVIDUALS FOR HIV-RELATED OFFENSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) At present, 32 States and 2 United States territories 
        have criminal statutes based on perceived exposure to HIV, 
        rather than behaviors motivated by an intent to harm, 
        presenting a significant risk of transmission and resulting in 
        actual transmission of HIV to another. 11 States have HIV-
        specific laws that make spitting or biting a felony, even 
        though it is not possible to transmit HIV via saliva. 24 States 
        require persons who are aware that they have HIV to disclose 
        their status to sexual partners, regardless of whether they are 
        noninfectious. 14 of these 24 States also require disclosure to 
        needle-sharing partners. 25 States criminalize 1 or more 
        behaviors that pose a low or negligible risk for HIV 
        transmission.
            (2) HIV-specific criminal laws are classified as felonies 
        in 28 States. In 3 States, a person's exposure to another to 
        HIV does not subject the person to criminal prosecution for 
        that act alone but may result in a sentence enhancement. 18 
        States impose sentences of up to 10 years per violation, 7 
        States impose sentences between 11 and 20 years, and 5 States 
        impose sentences of greater than 20 years.
            (3) When members of the Armed Forces acquire HIV, they are 
        issued orders that require them to disclose and use a condom 
        under all circumstances including when the known risk of 
        transmission is 0. Failure to disclose can result in 
        prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).
            (4) The number of prosecutions, arrests, and instances 
        where HIV-based charges are used to induce plea agreements is 
        unknown. Because State-level prosecution and arrest data are 
        not readily available in any national legal database, the 
        societal impact of these laws may be underestimated and most 
        cases that go to trial are not reduced to written, published 
        opinions.
            (5) State and Federal criminal law does not currently 
        reflect the 4 decades of medical advances and discoveries made 
        with regard to transmission and treatment of HIV/AIDS.
            (6) According to the CDC, correct and consistent male or 
        female condom use, or adherence to a preexposure prophylaxis 
        (PrEP) regimen that results in viral suppression, are very 
        effective in preventing HIV transmission. However, most State 
        HIV-specific laws and prosecutions do not treat the use of a 
        condom during sexual intercourse or adherence to PrEP as a 
        mitigating factor or evidence that the defendant did not intend 
        to transmit HIV.
            (7) Criminal laws and prosecutions do not take into account 
        the benefits of effective antiretroviral medications, which 
        suppress the virus to extremely low levels and further reduce 
        the already low risk of transmitting HIV to near 0.
            (8) In addition to HIV-specific criminal laws, general 
        criminal laws are often misused to prosecute people based on 
        their HIV status. Although HIV, and even AIDS, currently is 
        viewed as a treatable, chronic, medical condition, people 
        living with HIV have been charged under aggravated assault, 
        attempted murder, and even bioterrorism statutes because 
        prosecutors, courts, and legislators continue to view and 
        characterize the blood, semen, and saliva of people living with 
        HIV as a ``deadly weapon''.
            (9) Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that HIV-
        specific laws do not reduce risk-taking behavior or increase 
        disclosure by people living with or at risk of HIV, and there 
        is increasing evidence that these laws reduce the willingness 
        to get tested. Furthermore, placing legal responsibility for 
        preventing the transmission of HIV and other pathogens that can 
        be sexually transmitted exclusively on people diagnosed with a 
        sexually transmitted infection undermines the public health 
        message that all people are responsible for practicing 
        behaviors that protect themselves from HIV and other sexually 
        transmitted infections. Unfortunately, some State laws create 
        an expectation of disclosure work against public health 
        communication and discourage risk-reduction measures that could 
        prevent transmission as a result of those who are acutely 
        infected and unaware of their status.
            (10) The identity of an individual subject to an HIV-based 
        prosecution is broadcast through media reports, potentially 
        destroying employment opportunities and relationships and 
        violating the person's right to privacy.
            (11) Individuals who are convicted after an HIV-based 
        prosecution often must register as sex offenders even in cases 
        involving consensual sexual activity. Their employability is 
        destroyed, and their family relationships are fractured.
            (12) The United Nations, including the Joint United Nations 
        Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), urges governments to ``limit 
        criminalization to cases of intentional transmission''. This 
        requirement would limit prosecutions to situations ``where a 
        person knows his or her HIV-positive status, acts with the 
        intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it''. 
        UNAIDS also recommends that criminal law should not be applied 
        to cases where there is no significant risk of transmission.
            (13) In 2010, the Federal Government released the first 
        ever National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), which addressed HIV-
        specific criminal laws, stating: ``While we understand the 
        intent behind these laws, they may not have the desired effect 
        and they may make people less willing to disclose their status 
        by making people feel at even greater risk of discrimination. 
        In some cases, it may be appropriate for legislators to 
        reconsider whether existing laws continue to further the public 
        interest and public health. In many instances, the continued 
        existence and enforcement of these types of laws run counter to 
        scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may 
        undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening 
        and treatment.''. The NHAS also states that State legislatures 
        should consider reviewing HIV-specific criminal statutes to 
        ensure that they are consistent with current knowledge of HIV 
        transmission and support public health approaches to preventing 
        and treating HIV.
            (14) The Global Commission on HIV and the Law was launched 
        in June 2010 to examine laws and practices that criminalize 
        people living with and vulnerable to HIV and to develop 
        evidence-based recommendations for effective HIV responses. The 
        Commission calls for ``governments, civil society and 
        international bodies to repeal punitive laws and enact laws 
        that facilitate and enable effective responses to HIV 
        prevention, care and treatment services for all who need 
        them''. The Commission recommends against the enactment of 
        ``laws that explicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure 
        or non-disclosure of HIV status, which are counterproductive''.
            (15) In February 2019, the Department of Health and Human 
        Services (HHS) launched ``Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for 
        America'', a new initiative with an ambitious goal to end the 
        domestic HIV epidemic in 10 years by reducing new cases of HIV 
        by 75 percent by 2025 and by 90 percent by 2030. In this plan, 
        HHS notes that stigma ``can be a debilitating barrier 
        preventing people living with, or at risk for, HIV from 
        receiving the health care, services, and respect they need and 
        deserve''. Many of the States and jurisdictions identified as a 
        priority for the first 5 years of the plan have stigma-based 
        criminal statutes for perceived exposure to HIV. These statutes 
        run counter to the goals of this new initiative and stand in 
        the way of ending the domestic HIV epidemic.
    (b) Sense of Congress Regarding Laws or Regulations Directed at 
People Living With HIV.--It is the sense of Congress that Federal and 
State laws, policies, and regulations regarding people living with 
HIV--
            (1) should not place unique or additional burdens on such 
        individuals solely as a result of their HIV status; and
            (2) should instead demonstrate a public health-oriented, 
        evidence-based, medically accurate, and contemporary 
        understanding of--
                    (A) the multiple factors that lead to HIV 
                transmission;
                    (B) the relative risk of demonstrated HIV 
                transmission routes;
                    (C) the current health implications of living with 
                HIV;
                    (D) the associated benefits of treatment and 
                support services for people living with HIV; and
                    (E) the impact of punitive HIV-specific laws, 
                policies, regulations, and judicial precedents and 
                decisions on public health, on people living with or 
                affected by HIV, and on their families and communities.
    (c) Review of Federal and State Laws.--

                and the Secretary of Defense acting jointly (in this 
                section referred to as the ``designated officials'') 
                shall initiate a national review of Federal and State 
                laws, policies, regulations, and judicial precedents

                        clause (i) through (vii).
                    (C) Relation to other reviews.--In carrying out the 
                review under subparagraph (A), the designated officials 
                may utilize other existing reviews of criminal and 
                related civil commitment cases involving people living 
                with HIV, including any such review conducted by any 
                Federal or State agency or any public health, legal 
                advocacy, or trade organization or association if the 
                designated officials determines that such reviews were 
                conducted in accordance with the principles set forth 
                in subsection (b).
            (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after initiating the

        following:
                    (A) For each State and for the UCMJ, a summary of 
                the relevant laws, policies, regulations, and judicial 
                precedents and decisions regarding criminal cases 
                involving people living with HIV, including the 
                following:
                            (i) A determination of whether such laws, 
                        policies, regulations, and judicial precedents 
                        and decisions place any unique or additional 
                        burdens upon people living with HIV.
                            (ii) A determination of whether such laws, 
                        policies, regulations, and judicial precedents 
                        and decisions demonstrate a public health-
                        oriented, evidence-based, medically accurate, 
                        and contemporary understanding of--
                                    (I) the multiple factors that lead 
                                to HIV transmission;

                                transmission routes, including that a 
                                person that has an undetectable viral 
                                load cannot transmit the disease;
                                    (III) the current health 
                                implications of living with HIV,

                                engage in survival sex work against 
                                whom condom possession has been used as 
                                evidence to intent to commit a crime;
                                    (V) States that have the

                                specific laws and policies on public 
                                health, on people living with or 
                                affected by HIV, and on their families 
                                and communities, including people who 
                                are in abusive, dependent, violent, and 
                                nonconsensual relationships and are 
                                unable to both negotiate the use of 
                                condoms and status disclosure.
                            (iii) An analysis of the public health and 
                        legal implications of such laws, policies, 
                        regulations, and judicial precedents and 
                        decisions, including an analysis of the 
                        consequences of having a similar penal scheme 
                        applied to comparable situations involving 
                        other communicable diseases.
                            (iv) An analysis of the proportionality of 
                        punishments imposed under HIV-specific laws, 
                        policies, regulations, and judicial precedents, 
                        taking into consideration penalties attached to 
                        violation of State laws against similar degrees 
                        of endangerment or harm, such as driving while 
                        intoxicated or transmission of other 
                        communicable diseases, or more serious harms, 
                        such as vehicular manslaughter offenses.
                    (B) An analysis of common elements shared between 
                State laws, policies, regulations, and judicial 
                precedents.
                    (C) A set of best practice recommendations directed 
                to State governments, including State attorneys 
                general, public health officials, and judicial 
                officers, in order to ensure that laws, policies, 
                regulations, and judicial precedents regarding people 
                living with HIV are in accordance with the principles 
                set forth in subsection (b).
                    (D) Recommendations for adjustments to the UCMJ, 
                including discontinuing the use of a service member's 
                HIV diagnosis as the basis for prosecution, enhanced 
                penalties, or discharge from military service, in order 
                to ensure that laws, policies, regulations, and 
                judicial precedents regarding people living with HIV 
                are in accordance with the principles set forth in 
                subsection (b). Such recommendations should include any 
                necessary and appropriate changes to ``Orders to Follow 
                Preventative Medicine Requirements''.
            (3) Guidance.--Within 90 days of the release of the report 
        required by paragraph (2), the Attorney General and the 
        Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting jointly, shall 
        develop and publicly release updated guidance for States based 
        on the set of best practice recommendations required by 
        paragraph (2)(C) in order to assist States dealing with 
        criminal and related civil commitment cases regarding people

                            (III) treatment; and

                scientifically accurate information in a clear and 
                understandable manner.
            (4) HIV testing upon request.--
                    (A) Health care personnel shall allow inmates to 
                obtain HIV tests upon request once per year or whenever

                orally and in writing, inform inmates, during

                of their right to obtain HIV tests.
                    (B) Health care personnel shall encourage inmates

                tattoo, or if the inmate is concerned that the inmate 
                may have been exposed to HIV.
                    (C) An inmate's request for an HIV test shall not 
                be considered an indication that the inmate has put

                violation of prison rules.
            (5) HIV testing of pregnant woman.--

                the importance of adherence to antiretroviral therapy, 
                and the side effects of medications with inmates 
                receiving treatment.
                    (C) Health care personnel and pharmacy personnel 
                shall ensure that the facility formulary contains all

                pharmacy personnel shall develop and implement 
                distribution procedures to ensure timely and 
                confidential access to medications.

                training on the implementation of these procedures. 
                Penalties for violations of inmate confidentiality by 
                health care personnel or correctional staff shall be 
                specified and strictly enforced.
                    (B) HIV testing, counseling, and treatment shall be 
                provided in a confidential setting where other routine 
                health services are provided and in a manner that 
                allows the inmate to request and obtain these services 
                as routine medical services.
            (8) Testing, counseling, and referral prior to reentry.--

                Inmates who are already known to be infected need not 
                be tested again. This requirement may be waived if an 
                inmate's release occurs without sufficient notice to 
                the Director to allow health care personnel to perform 
                a routine HIV test and notify the inmate of the 
                results.
                    (B) All HIV tests under this paragraph shall comply 
                with the opt-out provision.
                    (C) To all inmates who test positive for HIV and 
                all inmates who already are known to have HIV, health 
                care personnel shall provide--

                        managing their medical condition in the 
                        community, accessing appropriate treatment and 
                        services in the community, and preventing the 
                        transmission of their condition to family 
                        members and other persons in the community;

                        providers and social service agencies in the 
                        community that meet the inmate's individual 
                        needs, including voluntary partner notification 
                        services and prevention counseling services for

                        necessary medications the inmate is currently 
                        receiving.
            (9) Opt-out provision.--Inmates shall have the right to 
        refuse routine HIV testing. Inmates shall be informed both

        disclosure of this right may be included with other general 
        health information and counseling provided to inmates by health 
        care personnel. If an inmate refuses a routine test for HIV, 
        health care personnel shall make a note of the inmate's refusal 
        in the inmate's confidential medical records. However, the 
        inmate's refusal shall not be considered a violation of prison 
        rules or result in disciplinary action. Any reference in this 
        section to the ``opt-out provision'' shall be deemed a 
        reference to the requirement of this paragraph.

        from the definition of routine hiv testing.--HIV testing of an 
        inmate under section 4014(b) of title 18, United States Code, 
        is not routine HIV testing for the purposes of the opt-out 
        provision. Health care personnel shall document the reason for 
        testing under section 4014(b) of title 18, United States Code, 
        in the inmate's confidential medical records.
            (11) Timely notification of test results.--Health care

                to be at risk for infection with such virus in 
                accordance with the guidelines issued by the Bureau of 
                Prisons relating to infectious disease management'' and 
                inserting ``unless the individual declines. The 
                Attorney General shall also cause such individual to be 
                so tested before release unless the individual 
                declines.''.
            (2) Inadmissibility of hiv test results in civil and 
        criminal proceedings.--Section 4014(d) of title 18, United 
        States Code, is amended by inserting ``or under the Stop HIV in 
        Prison Act'' after ``under this section''.
            (3) Screening as part of routine screening.--Section 
        4014(e) of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding 
        at the end the following: ``Such rules shall also provide that

SEC. 7301. NATIONAL ASTHMA BURDEN.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980 and 
        affects more than 26,000,000 people in the United States.
            (2) Significant disparities in asthma morbidity and 
        mortality exist for both adults and children particularly for 
        low-income and minority populations, particularly African 
        Americans and Puerto Ricans.
            (3) African-American children are twice as likely to have 
        asthma as White children.
            (4) In 2016, almost 4,500,000 non-Hispanic African 
        Americans reported having asthma. African Americans with asthma 
        are 3 times as likely to visit the emergency department and 
        twice as likely to get hospitalized as White patients with 
        asthma.
            (5) Puerto Ricans are 3.4 times as likely to die from 
        asthma compared with all other Hispanic or Latino groups. 
        Overall Hispanic Americans are 30 percent more likely to be 
        hospitalized for asthma than non-Hispanic Whites.
            (6) The majority of adults with asthma are women.

SEC. 7303. INFLUENZA AND PNEUMONIA VACCINATION CAMPAIGN.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--
            (1) enhance the annual campaign by the Department of Health 
        and Human Services to increase the number of people vaccinated

SEC. 7304. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (referred to in 
        this subsection as ``COPD'') refers to chronic bronchitis and 
        emphysema, incurable diseases that make it difficult to exhale 
        all the air from one's lungs, and that can cause persistent 
        coughing, shortness of breath, and sputum.
            (2) COPD exacerbations--episodes of acute difficulty 
        breathing and moderate to severe fatigue--are dangerous, and 
        their treatment often requires hospitalization.
            (3) While smoking is the primary risk factor for COPD, 
        other risk factors include air pollution, occupational 
        exposures, heredity, a history of childhood respiratory 
        infections, and socioeconomic status.
            (4) It is estimated that over 16,000,000 adults in the 
        United States have COPD.
            (5) COPD is a leading cause of death in the United States, 
        claiming over 156,000 lives in 2019.
            (6) Since 2000, deaths for women with COPD have exceeded 
        deaths in men.
            (7) Although African Americans have a lower prevalence of 
        COPD in the United States, researchers have shown that African 
        Americans may be underdiagnosed. Furthermore, research has 
        shown that African Americans develop COPD with less cumulative 
        smoke exposure and at a younger age.
    (b) In General.--The Director of the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention shall conduct, support, and expand public health 
strategies, prevention, diagnosis, surveillance, and public and 
professional awareness activities regarding chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.
    (c) Chronic Disease Prevention Programs.--The Director of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute shall carry out the 
following:
            (1) Conduct public education and awareness activities with 
        patient and professional organizations to stimulate earlier 
        diagnosis and improve patient outcomes from treatment of 
        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To the extent known and 
        relevant, such public education and awareness activities shall 
        reflect differences in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by 
        cause (tobacco, environmental, occupational, biological, and 
        genetic) and include a focus on outreach to undiagnosed and, as 
        appropriate, minority populations.
            (2) Supplement and expand upon the activities of the 
        National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute by making grants to 
        nonprofit organizations, State and local jurisdictions, and 
        Indian Tribes for the purpose of reducing the burden of chronic 
        obstructive pulmonary disease, especially in disproportionately 
        impacted communities, through public health interventions and 
        related activities.
            (3) Coordinate with the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, the Indian Health Service, the Health Resources and 
        Services Administration, and the Department of Veterans Affairs 
        to develop pilot programs to demonstrate best practices for the 
        diagnosis and management of chronic obstructive pulmonary 
        disease.
            (4) Develop improved techniques and identify best 
        practices, in coordination with the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs, for assisting chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
        patients to successfully stop smoking, including identification 
        of subpopulations with different needs. Initiatives under this 
        paragraph may include research to determine whether successful 
        smoking cessation strategies are different for chronic 
        obstructive pulmonary disease patients compared to such 
        strategies for patients with other chronic diseases.
    (d) Environmental and Occupational Health Programs.--The Director 
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall--
            (1) support research into the environmental and 
        occupational causes and biological mechanisms that contribute 
        to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and
            (2) develop and disseminate public health interventions 
        that will lessen the impact of environmental and occupational 
        causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
    (e) Data Collection.--Not later than 180 days after the enactment 
of this Act, the Director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood 
Institute and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, acting jointly, shall assess the depth and quality of 
information on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is collected 
in surveys and population studies conducted by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, including whether there are additional 
opportunities for information to be collected in the National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey, the National Health Interview Survey, 
and the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System surveys.
    (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary 
for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027.

                        Subtitle H--Tuberculosis

SEC. 7351. ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF TUBERCULOSIS.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``End 
Tuberculosis Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the United States, 7,174 people were diagnosed with 
        tuberculosis (referred to in this section as ``TB'') in 2020.
            (2) Disparities in TB exist and significantly impact 
        minority communities in the United States. The Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention (referred to in this section as 
        ``CDC'') finds that 89 percent of people diagnosed with TB 
        disease in 2020 self-identified as racial and ethnic 
        minorities.
            (3) African Americans comprised 19.6 percent of people 
        diagnosed with TB disease during 2020. The population-adjusted 
        rate of TB among African Americans is 1.5 times higher than the 
        national total, and 8.0 times higher than among Whites.
            (4) Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific 
        Islanders comprised 37.4 percent of people diagnosed with TB 
        disease during 2020. The population-adjusted rate of TB among 
        Asian Americans is 6 times higher than the national total, and 
        33.25 times higher than among Whites. The population-adjusted 
        rate of TB among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders 
        is 8.5 times higher than the national total, and 46.75 times 
        higher than among Whites.
            (5) Hispanics and Latinos comprised 29.7 percent of people 
        diagnosed with TB disease during 2020. The population-adjusted 
        rate of TB among Hispanics and Latinos is 1.6 times higher than 
        the national total, and 8.75 times higher than among Whites.
            (6) TB is both preventable and curable, but the current 
        rate of decline of TB in the United States remains too slow to 
        achieve TB elimination in this century.
            (7) TB is transmitted through the air when a person who has 
        TB disease in their lungs coughs or sneezes. People who are in 
        close proximity to the person with TB can breathe in the TB 
        bacteria, and the bacteria will initially settle in their 
        lungs. Living conditions related to poverty, such as crowded 
        housing and poor ventilation, can greatly increase the risk of 
        transmission. Without proper and timely diagnosis and access to 
        treatment, the TB bacteria may grow and spread to other parts 
        of their body.
            (8) As many as 13,000,000 people in the United States may 
        have latent TB infection (referred to in this section as 
        ``LTBI''). People with LTBI have TB bacteria in their bodies, 
        but their immune system is containing the bacteria, and they 
        are not sick, nor do they have any current risk of spreading TB 
        to others. LTBI can activate into infectious, life-threatening 
        TB if not treated. Modeling has shown that eliminating TB is 
        not possible without addressing LTBI.
            (9) Comorbidities associated with TB include cancer, 
        diabetes mellitus, and HIV. People with these medical 
        conditions and compromised immune systems are more likely to 
        develop active TB disease and to have worse outcomes from TB. 
        Many of the communities placed at highest risk of other adverse 
        health outcomes and injustices are also disproportionately 
        impacted by TB, and these include people experiencing 
        homelessness and housing instability, people in congregate 
        living and carceral settings, and people born outside of the 
        United States.
            (10) Forms of active TB that do not show drug resistance 
        are classified as drug-susceptible TB (referred to in this 
        section as ``DS-TB''). Drug-resistant TB (referred to in this 
        section as ``DR-TB'') is a rising threat to the public health 
        of the United States. DR-TB that exhibits resistance to two or 
        more first-line drugs is referred to as multi-drug resistant TB 
        (referred to in this section as ``MDR-TB''). MDR-TB that also 
        is resistant to at least one fluoroquinolone, and at least one 
        additional group A second-line medicine is classified as 
        extensively drug-resistant TB (referred to in this section as 
        ``XDR-TB'').
            (11) Approximately 56 people in the United States were 
        diagnosed with MDR-TB in 2020. One person was diagnosed with 
        XDR-TB in the same year.
            (12) In the United States, $503,000,000 was spent in 2020 
        to treat TB; direct treatment costs average $20,211 to treat a 
        patient with DS-TB, $182,186 to treat a patient with MDR-TB, 
        and $567,708 to treat a patient with XDR-TB. When factoring in 
        productivity losses during treatment, DS-TB averages $24,661, 
        MDR-TB averages $347,324, and XDR-TB averages $729,039. 
        Treatment is often difficult, with daily complex multi-pill 
        regimens, with side-effects ranging from hearing and vision 
        loss to mental health issues.
            (13) Recognizing the public health, economic, and societal 
        costs to the threat of MDR-TB, the National Action Plan to 
        Combat MDR-TB was developed by the White House to provide the 
        United States with a comprehensive three-pronged strategy to 
        address MDR-TB by strengthening domestic capacity to combat 
        MDR-TB; improve international capacity and cooperation to 
        combat MDR-TB; and accelerate basic and applied research and 
        development for new therapies, diagnostics, and prevention 
        strategies to combat MDR-TB.
            (14) Additional Federal support is necessary to expand TB 
        control efforts in case finding and treatment to address LTBI 
        in a national prevention initiative. Key policy and research 
        breakthroughs increase the success of a TB prevention 
        initiative: the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force 
        recommendation's ``B'' rating, screening for LTBI among high-
        risk adults as a covered service increases the likelihood that 
        impacted racial and ethnic minority groups can get tested for 
        TB; a new, shorter course treatment regimen reduces the length 
        of treatment for LTBI from every day for 6 to 9 months to one 
        dose per week for 12 weeks, increasing the likelihood of 
        treatment completion; and the use of blood-based diagnostic 
        tests, Interferon-gamma release assays or IGRAs, increases the 
        ability to detect LTBI among patients in affected communities.
            (15) The right to health, and the right to science as a 
        necessary human right to help achieve the right to health, is 
        enshrined in Articles 25 and 27 of the Universal Declaration of 
        Human Rights. These fundamental human rights cannot be achieved 
        when anyone lacks access to TB prevention or treatment, and 
        when the benefits of scientific innovation are not extended to 
        people with all forms of TB.

        Subtitle I--Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases

SEC. 7401. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Eighty percent of African-American women and nearly 74 
        percent of Hispanic men are either overweight or obese, 
        speeding the onset and progression of knee arthritis.
            (2) Arthritis affects 58,500,000 people in the United 
        States, and that number will rise to 78,000,000 by the year 
        2040.
            (3) 32,500,000 people in the United States suffer from 
        osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, making it 
        the leading cause of disability in the United States. 
        Osteoarthritis is sometimes referred to as degenerative joint 
        disease.
            (4) Obesity accelerates the onset of arthritis: 70 percent 
        of obese adults with mild osteoarthritis of the knee at age 60 
        will develop advanced end-stage disease by age 80. In contrast, 
        just 43 percent of non-obese adults will have end-stage disease 
        over the same time period.
            (5) Arthritis affects 1 in 4 people in the United States 
        and is the single greatest cause of chronic pain and disability 
        in the United States.
            (6) Women, Black Americans, and Hispanics have more severe 
        arthritis and functional limitations. These same individuals 
        are more likely to be obese and diabetic, and have a higher 
        incidence of heart diseases.
            (7) Arthritis costs $304,000,000,000 a year, including 
        $140,000,000,000 in direct costs (medical) and $164,000,000,000 
        in indirect costs (lost earnings).
            (8) Obesity and other chronic health conditions exacerbate 
        the debilitating impact of arthritis, leading to inactivity, 
        loss of independence, and a perpetual cycle of comorbid chronic 
        conditions.
            (9) Sixty-one percent of arthritis sufferers are women, and 
        women represent 64 percent of an estimated 43,000,000 annual 
        visits to physicians' offices and outpatient clinics where 
        arthritis was the primary diagnosis. Women also represented 60 
        percent of approximately 1,000,000 hospitalizations that 
        occurred in 2003 for which arthritis was the primary diagnosis.
            (10) Women ages 65 and older have up to 2\1/2\ times more 
        disabilities than men of the same age. Higher rates of obesity 
        and arthritis among this group explained up to 48 percent of 
        the gender gap in disability, above all other common chronic 
        health conditions.
            (11) The primary indication for total knee arthroplasty 
        (referred to in this section as ``TKA''), also known as knee 
        replacement, is relief of significant, disabling pain caused by 
        severe arthritis.
            (12) Knee replacement is surgery for people with severe 
        knee damage. Knee replacement can relieve pain and allow an 
        individual to be more active. The process for a total knee 
        replacement involves the surgeon removing damaged cartilage and 
        bone from the surface of the knee joint and replacing the 
        cartilage and bone with a man-made surface of metal and 
        plastic. In a partial knee replacement, the surgeon only 
        replaces part of the knee joint.
            (13) Total hip replacement, also called total hip 
        arthroplasty (referred to in this section as ``THA''), is used 
        if hip pain interferes with daily activities and more 
        conservative treatments have not helped. Arthritis damage is 
        the most common reason to need hip replacement.
            (14) The odds of a family practice physician recommending 
        TKA to a male patient with moderate arthritis are twice that of 
        a female patient, while the odds of an orthopedic surgeon 
        recommending TKA to a male patient with moderate arthritis are 
        22 times that of a female patient.
            (15) Black Americans with doctor-diagnosed arthritis have a 
        higher prevalence of severe pain attributable to arthritis, 
        compared with White Americans (34.0 percent versus 22.6 
        percent). Black Americans, compared to White Americans, report 
        a higher proportion of work limitations (39.5 percent versus 
        28.0 percent) and a higher prevalence of arthritis-attributable 
        work limitation (6.6 percent versus 4.6 percent).
            (16) Hispanics are 50 percent more likely than non-Hispanic 
        Whites to report needing assistance with at least one 
        instrumental activity of daily living and to have difficulty 
        walking.
            (17) Black Americans and Hispanics were 1.3 times more 
        likely to have activity limitation, 1.6 times more likely to 
        have work limitations, and 1.9 times more likely to have severe 
        joint pain than Whites.
            (18) In 2003, the National Academy of Medicine reported 
        that the rates of TKA and THA among Black American and Hispanic 
        patients are significantly lower than for Whites--even for 
        those with equitable health care coverage such as through 
        Medicare or the Department of Veterans Affairs.
            (19) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, in 2000, Black American Medicare enrollees were 37 
        percent less likely than White Medicare enrollees to undergo 
        total knee replacements. In 2006, the disparity increased to 39 
        percent.
            (20) Even after adjusting for insurance and health access, 
        Hispanics and Black Americans are almost 50 percent less likely 
        to undergo total knee replacement than Whites.

            Subtitle J--Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders

SEC. 7451. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This subtitle may be cited as the ``Sleep and 
Circadian Rhythm Disorders Health Disparities Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Decrements in sleep health such as sleep apnea, 
        insufficient sleep time, and insomnia, affect 50,000,000 to 
        70,000,000 adults in the United States. An estimated 25,000,000 
        adults in the United States have sleep apnea, a chronic 
        disorder characterized by one or more pauses in breathing which 
        can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times 
        or more an hour, disrupting sleep and resulting in excessive 
        daytime sleepiness and loss in productivity.
            (2) Seventy percent of high school students are not getting 
        enough sleep on school nights, while 35 percent of people in 
        the United States get fewer than 7 hours of sleep per night, 
        and roughly 1,550 fatal motor vehicle crashes are caused by 
        drowsy drivers.
            (3) Insufficient sleep and insomnia are more prevalent in 
        women. Women who are pregnant and have sleep apnea are at an 
        increased risk of cardiovascular complications during 
        pregnancy. The impact of disparities in sleep health is 
        associated with a growing number of health problems, including 
        the following:
                    (A) Hypertension.
                    (B) Cancer.
                    (C) Stroke.
                    (D) Cardiac arrhythmia.
                    (E) Chronic heart failure and heart disease.
                    (F) Diabetes.
                    (G) Cognitive functioning and behavior.
                    (H) Depression and bipolar disorder.
                    (I) Substance abuse.
            (4) A sleep disparity exists in that poor sleep quality is 
        strongly associated with poverty, race, and social determinants 
        of health. Factors such as employment, education, and health 
        status, amongst others, significantly mediated this effect only 
        in poor subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to 
        these factors in poor relative to nonpoor individuals in the 
        context of sleep quality.
            (5) Black Americans sleep worse than White Americans. Black 
        Americans take longer to fall asleep, report poorer sleep 
        quality, have more light and less deep sleep, and nap more 
        often and longer.
            (6) Black Americans and individuals in lower socioeconomic 
        status groups may be at an increased risk for sleep 
        disturbances and associated health consequences.
            (7) Among young Black Americans, the likelihood of having 
        sleep disordered breathing and exhibiting risk factors for poor 
        sleep is twice that in young White Americans. Frequent snoring 
        is more common among Black American and Hispanic women and 
        Hispanic men compared to non-Hispanic White Americans, 
        independent of other factors including obesity.
            (8) Black Americans with sleep-disordered breathing develop 
        symptoms at a younger age than Caucasians but appear less 
        likely to be diagnosed and treated in a timely manner. This 
        delay may at least in part be due to reduced access to care.
            (9) Sleep loss contributes to increased risk for chronic 
        conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all of 
        which have increased prevalence in underserved, 
        underrepresented minorities. Racial and ethnic disparities 
        related to obesity may also contribute to disparities in health 
        outcomes related to sleep-disordered breathing.
            (10) Underrepresented minorities in the United States 
        report an insomnia rate of 12.9 percent compared to only 6.6 
        percent for White Americans.
            (11) Black women have a higher incidence of insomnia than 
        Black men, perhaps related in part to higher risk for chronic 
        persisting symptoms.

            (4) develop study designs, data sampling and collection 
        tools, and analytical approaches to optimize understanding of 
        mediating and moderating factors, and feedback mechanisms 
        coupling sleep to cardiovascular and metabolic health 
        disparities;
            (5) advance research to understand cultural and linguistic 
        barriers (on the person, provider, or system level) to access 
        to care, medical diagnosis, and treatment of sleep disorders in 
        diverse population groups;
            (6) develop and test multilevel interventions (including 
        sleep health education in diverse communities) to reduce 
        disparities in sleep health that will impact ability to improve 
        disparities in cardiovascular and metabolic risk or disease;
            (7) create opportunities to integrate sleep and health 
        disparity science by strategically utilizing resources 
        (existing or anticipated cohorts), exchanging scientific data 
        and ideas (cross-over into scientific meetings), and develop

  Subtitle K--Kidney Disease Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and 
                               Treatment

SEC. 7501. KIDNEY DISEASE, RESEARCH, SURVEILLANCE, PREVENTION, AND 
              TREATMENT.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Kidney Disease 
Research, Surveillance, Prevention and Treatment Improvement Act of 
2022''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Kidney diseases impact 37,000,000 individuals in the 
        United States.
            (2) Black Americans comprise just 13 percent of the United 
        States population, but 33 percent of the United States dialysis 
        patient population. Compared to White Americans, kidney failure 
        prevalence is about 3.7 times greater in Black Americans, 1.4 
        times greater in Native Americans, and 1.5 times greater in 
        Asian Americans.
            (3) Peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis use is 40-50 
        percent lower among Black Americans and Hispanics.
            (4) Every racial and ethnic minority group in the United 
        States is significantly less likely to be treated with home 
        dialysis than Whites, and demographic and clinical 
        characteristics are insufficient to explain this differential 
        use.
            (5) Black Americans on dialysis, irrespective of dialysis 
        modality, and Hispanics undergoing PD or in-center HD, are 
        significantly less likely than their White counterparts to 
        receive a kidney transplant.
            (6) Black Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans are 
        less likely to receive living donor kidney transplants than 
        Whites. Efforts to reduce disparities in live donor kidney 
        transplantation for Black American, Hispanic, and Asian 
        patients with kidney failure have been largely unsuccessful.
            (7) Medicare and Medicaid patients are less likely to 
        receive a preemptive transplant from a deceased donor compared 
        to private insurance patients (5 percent and 11 percent versus 
        24 percent), and Black and Hispanic patients are less likely to 
        receive a preemptive transplant from a deceased donor compared 
        with White patients even after changes to the kidney allocation 
        system (5 percent of Black patients and 5 percent of Hispanic 
        patients compared with 18 percent of White patients).
            (8) Low-income populations are significantly more likely to 
        progress to kidney failure.
            (9) Low socioeconomic status is associated with increased 
        incidence of chronic kidney disease, progression to kidney 
        failure, inadequate dialysis treatment, and reduced access to 
        kidney transplantation.
            (10) The 3 goals of Executive Order 13879 of July 10, 2019 
        (84 Fed. Reg. 33817; relating to Advancing American Kidney 
        Health), recognize the need for more transplants, better 
        prevention and education, and improved access to treatment 
        modalities.

        an individual to promote the participation in an approved 
        clinical trial, as defined in subsection (d) of the first 
        section 2709 of the Public Health Service Act, that is 
        registered with the database of clinical trials maintained by 
        the National Library of Medicine (or any successor database), 
        so long as such remuneration facilitates equitable inclusion of 
        patients from all relevant demographic and socioeconomic 
        populations and is related to patient participation in the 
        approved clinical trial)'' after ``promotes access to care''.
            (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) 
        shall apply to remuneration provided on or after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act.

SEC. 9005. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING FULL FUNDING OF ACTIVITIES TO 
              ELIMINATE RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The health status of the population of the United 
        States is declining, and the United States currently ranks 
        below most industrialized nations in health status measured by 
        longevity, sickness, and mortality.
            (2) Racial and ethnic minority populations tend to have the 
        poorest health status and face substantial cultural, social, 
        political, and economic barriers to obtaining high-quality 
        health care.
            (3) Racial and ethnic minority populations experience and 
        suffer from the extreme and egregious health disparities and 
        inequities that are caused by racism, discrimination, and 
        implicit racial and ethnic bias in and throughout the health 
        care system.
            (4) Communities of color with intersecting identities and 
        backgrounds, including children, older adults, women, people 
        with disabilities, people with limited English proficiency, 
        immigrants, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 
        questioning populations, and people with lower incomes 
        experience significant personal and structural barriers to 
        obtaining affordable, high-quality health care.
            (5) Efforts to reduce and eliminate racial and ethnic 
        health disparities and inequities, and improve minority health, 
        have been limited by inadequate resources (funding, staffing, 
        and stewardship), a lack of prioritization, and a lack of 
        accountability from the Federal Government, particularly due to 
        stagnant or declining appropriations that are not in line with 
        the dire need faced by communities that are impacted.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) health disparities negatively impact outcomes for 
        health and human security of the Nation;
            (2) reducing racial, ethnic, age, sexual, and gender 
        disparities in prevention and treatment are unique civil and 
        human rights challenges and, as such, Federal agencies and 
        health care entities and systems receiving Federal funds should 
        be accountable for their role in causing disparities and 
        inequity;
            (3) funding for the National Institute on Minority Health 
        and Health Disparities, the Office of Civil Rights in the 
        Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute 
        of Nursing Research, and the Office of Minority Health should 
        be doubled by fiscal year 2023, to effectively address racial 
        and ethnic disparities elimination in health and health care as 
        a matter of health and national security;
            (4) adequate funding by fiscal year 2023, and subsequent 
        funding increases, should be provided for health and human 
        service professions training programs, the Racial and Ethnic 
        Approaches to Community Health Initiative at the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention, the Minority HIV/AIDS 
        Initiative, the Excellence Centers to Eliminate Ethnic/Racial 
        Disparities Program at the Agency for Healthcare Research and 
        Quality, and the National Health Service Corps Scholarship 
        Program initiatives, programs, policies, projects, and 
        activities that are the backbone of the Nation's agenda to 
        eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities and inequities;
            (5) adequate funding for fiscal year 2023 and increased 
        funding for future years should be provided for the Racial and 
        Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Initiative's United 
        States Risk Factor Survey to ensure adequate data collection to 
        track health disparities, and there should be appropriate 
        avenues provided to disseminate findings to the general public;
            (6) current and newly created health disparity elimination 
        incentives, programs, agencies, and departments under this Act 
        (and the amendments made by this Act) should receive adequate 
        staffing and funding by fiscal year 2023; and
            (7) stewardship and accountability should be provided to 
        the Congress and the President for measurable and sustainable 
        progress toward health disparity elimination under programs 
        under this Act, including increased data collection and 
        reporting, capacity building for impacted communities, 
        technical assistance, training programs, and avenues to 
        disseminate program details and successes to the public and to 
        policymakers.

                        subsection that raises an issue of significant 
                        public importance.
                    (B) Cases by referral.--The Director may determine, 
                based on a pattern of complaints, a pattern of 
                violations, a review of data reported by a health care 
                provider covered by subsection (a), or any other means, 
                that there is reasonable cause to believe a health care 
                provider is engaged in a pattern or practice that 
                violates subsection (a). If the Director makes such a 
                determination, the Director shall refer the related 
                findings to the Attorney General. If the Attorney 
                General finds that such reasonable cause exists, the 
                Attorney General may commence a civil action in any 
                appropriate district court of the United States.
            (2) Enforcement of subpoenas.--The Attorney General, on 
        behalf of the Director, or another party at whose request a 
        subpoena is issued under this subsection, may enforce such 
        subpoena in appropriate proceedings in the district court of 
        the United States for the district in which the person to whom 
        the subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts 
        business.
            (3) Relief which may be granted in civil actions.--
                    (A) In general.--In a civil action under paragraph 
                (1), the court--
                            (i) may award such preventive relief, 
                        including a permanent or temporary injunction, 
                        temporary restraining order, or other order 
                        against the person responsible for a violation 
                        of subsection (a) as is necessary to assure the 
                        full enjoyment of the rights granted by this 
                        subsection;
                            (ii) may award such other relief as the 
                        court determines to be appropriate, including 
                        monetary damages, to aggrieved persons; and
                            (iii) may, to vindicate the public 
                        interest, assess punitive damages against the 
                        respondent--
                                    (I) in an amount not exceeding 
                                $500,000, for a first violation; and
                                    (II) in an amount not exceeding 
                                $1,000,000, for any subsequent 
                                violation.
                    (B) Fees and costs.--In a civil action under this

                prevailing party, other than the United States, a

        social characteristics of a community or enhance quality of 
        human life, including--
                    (A) homes, schools, and places of work and worship;
                    (B) parks, recreation areas, and greenways;
                    (C) transportation systems;
                    (D) business, industry, and agriculture; and
                    (E) land-use plans, projects, and policies that 
                impact the physical or social characteristics of a 
                community, including access to services and amenities.
            (4) Determinants of health.--The term ``determinants of 
        health''--
                    (A) means the range of nonclinical factors 
                inclusive of personal, social, economic, and 
                environmental factors that directly influence health 
                status; and
                    (B) includes social determinants of health (which 
                are sometimes referred to as ``social and economic 
                determinants of health'', ``socioeconomic determinants 
                of health'', ``environmental determinants of health'', 
                ``social drivers of inequality'', or ``personal 
                determinants of health'').
            (5) Economic determinants of health.--The term ``economic 
        determinants of health'' means income and social status.
            (6) Environmental determinants of health.--The term 
        ``environmental determinants of health'' means the broad 
        physical (including manmade and natural), psychological, 
        social, spiritual, cultural, and aesthetic environment.
            (7) Personal determinants of health.--The term ``personal 
        determinants of health'' means an individual's behavior, 
        biology, and genetics.
            (8) Social determinants of health.--The term ``social 
        determinants of health'' means a subset of determinants of the 
        health of individuals and environments (such as communities, 
        neighborhoods, and societies) that describe an individual's or 
        group of people's social identity, describe the social and 
        economic resources to which such individual or group has 
        access, and describe the conditions in which an individual or 
        group of people works, lives, and plays.

SEC. 10002. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Social determinants of health are the greatest 
        predictors of health outcomes.
            (2) Social determinants of health, including health-related 
        behaviors, social and economic factors, and physical 
        environment factors account for 80 percent of health outcomes, 
        whereas clinical care accounts for 20 percent of improved 
        health outcomes. Yet, in 2017, public health spending 
        represented only 2.5 percent of all health spending in the 
        United States.
            (3) There are more opportunities to improve health for 
        everyone when we understand that health starts, first, not in a 
        medical setting, but in our families, in our schools and 
        workplaces, in our neighborhoods, in the air we breathe, and in 
        the water we drink.
            (4)(A) Healthy People 2030 identifies health and health 
        care quality as a function of not only access to health care, 
        but also the social determinants of health, categorized into 
        the following: neighborhoods and the built environment; social 
        and community context; education; and economic stability.
            (B) The following examples illustrate the nexus between the 
        unequal distribution of the social determinants of health and 
        health inequities:
                    (i) The built environment influences residents' 
                level of physical activity. Neighborhoods with high 
                levels of poverty are significantly less likely to have 
                places where children can be physically active, such as 
                parks, green spaces, and bike paths and lanes. 
                Neighborhoods and communities can provide opportunities 
                for physical activity and support active lifestyles 
                through accessible and safe parks and open spaces and 
                through land use policy, zoning, and healthy community 
                design.
                    (ii) Emotional and physical health and well-being 
                are directly impacted by perceived levels of safety, 
                such as unlit streets at night. Community members have 
                expressed that safety is not only a barrier to 
                accessing programs and services that increase quality 
                of life, but also a barrier to accessing physical 
                activity in their community through the built 
                environment.
                    (iii) Historical and institutional racism in the 
                United States has shaped the way in which social and 
                economic resources and exposure to health promoting 
                environments are distributed. Income, education, 
                occupation, neighborhood conditions, schools, 
                workplaces, the use of health and social services, and 
                experiences with the criminal justice system are all 
                highly patterned by race, with people of color 
                experiencing more that is health harming. Finding ways 
                to uncouple the link between race and access to 
                resources and healthy environments is a principal means 
                of reducing health inequities. Additionally, the 
                anticipation of racism itself causes higher 
                psychological and cardiovascular stress levels that are 
                linked to poor health outcomes. Remedying 
                discriminatory practices at the individual and systemic 
                levels will likely reduce health inequities caused by 
                this unequal distribution of stress.
                    (iv) Poor health among Native Americans has largely 
                been driven by post-colonial oppression and historical 
                trauma. The expropriation of native lands and 
                territories to the American state had severe 
                consequences on Native American health. This resulted 
                in the deprivation of traditional food sources--and 
                nutrients--for Native Americans and also the 
                destruction of traditional economies and community 
                organization. Today, Native Americans have twice the 
                rate of diabetes of non-Hispanic Whites. Recognition of 
                the origins of diabetes as having a social and 
                community context, rather than just individual 
                responsibility and genetic predisposition, will shape 
                better policy to provide food security.
                    (v) In the context of prisons, overcrowding has led 
                to the deterioration of the physical and mental health 
                of individuals after they leave prison. In particular, 
                the mass incarceration of African-American males as a 
                result of inequities within and treatment in the 
                criminal justice system has contributed to an 
                overburdening of certain infectious diseases within the 
                African-American community. As a social institution, 
                incarceration amplifies existing adverse health 
                conditions by concentrating diseases and harmful health 
                behaviors such as tobacco use, drug use, and violence.
                    (vi) Educational attainment is the strongest 
                predictor of adult mortality. It is a basic component 
                of socioeconomic status that shapes earning potential 
                to access resources that promote health. People with 
                more education are less likely to report that they are 
                in poor health, and are also less likely to have 
                diabetes and other chronic diseases.
                    (vii) Individuals with lower levels of educational 
                attainment are much more likely to report to be current 
                smokers. In 2017, smoking prevalence was 36.8 percent 
                among adults with a GED diploma, 23.1 percent with less 
                than a high school diploma, and 18.7 percent with a 
                high school diploma, while dropping significantly to 
                7.1 percent among adults with an undergraduate college 
                degree and 4.1 percent with a postgraduate college 
                degree.
                    (viii) Income inequality differences account for a 
                large part of health inequities. For example, children 
                living in poverty experience poorer housing conditions, 
                increased exposure to indoor allergens and toxins (such 
                as pesticides, lead, mercury, radon, air pollution, and 
                carcinogens), increased food insecurity, and more 
                psychological stress. These experiences culminate in 
                worse adult health as compared with children with 
                higher socioeconomic status. Specifically, children 
                living in lower socioeconomic neighborhoods have higher 
                rates of asthma due to higher rates of psychological 
                stress resulting from higher rates of violence. Food 
                insecurity is associated with obesity and racial and 
                ethnic minorities have higher rates of food insecurity.
                    (ix) Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or 
                questioning, intersex, and asexual or allied (referred 
                to in this section as ``LGBTQIA+'') individuals face 
                health inequities linked to societal stigma, 
                discrimination, and denial of their civil and human 
                rights. Discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals has 
                been associated with high rates of psychiatric 
                disorders, substance abuse, and suicide. Experiences of 
                violence and victimization are frequent for LGBTQIA+ 
                individuals, and have long-lasting effects on the 
                individual and the community. Personal, family, and 
                social acceptance of sexual orientation and gender 
                identity affects the mental health and personal safety 
                of LGBTQIA+ individuals.
                    (x) Individuals in older and cheaper housing are at 
                higher risks to be exposed to lead, particularly in 
                housing built prior to 1960. The threat of lead 
                poisoning disproportionally affects vulnerable 
                populations, with children living in poverty (5.6 
                percent) and Black children (5.6) experiencing the 
                highest rates. According to the Department of Housing 
                and Urban Development, about 3,600,000 homes nationwide 
                that house young children have lead hazards such as 
                contaminated drinking water, peeling paint, 
                contaminated dust, or toxic soil. The combined cost of 
                medical treatment and special education for lead 
                poisoned children averages about $5,600 per child per 
                year, and lead poisoning costs the United States an 
                estimated $50,000,000,000 annually.
                    (xi) According to the report Healthy People 2030, 
                individuals with disabilities, as a group, experience 
                health inequities in routine public health arenas such 
                as health behaviors, clinical preventive services, and 
                chronic conditions. Compared with individuals without 
                disabilities, individuals with disabilities are--
                            (I) less likely to receive recommended 
                        preventive health care services, such as 
                        routine teeth cleanings and cancer screenings;
                            (II) at a high risk for poor health 
                        outcomes such as obesity, hypertension, falls-
                        related injuries, and mood disorders such as 
                        depression; and
                            (III) more likely to engage in unhealthy 
                        behaviors that put their health at risk, such 
                        as cigarette smoking and inadequate physical 
                        activity.
            (5) Laws and regulations that improve opportunities to live 
        in safe neighborhoods with more social cohesion, attain higher 
        education, sustain stable employment, and bridge class 
        differences help foster the health and safety of individuals.
            (6) The global public health community has reached 
        consensus through the Rio Political Declaration of Social 
        Determinants of Health adopted by the World Health Organization 
        in October 2011 that ``[c]ollaboration in coordinated and 
        intersectoral policy actions has proven to be effective. Health 
        in All Policies, an initiative of the American Public Health 
        Association, together with intersectoral cooperation and 
        action, is one promising approach to enhance accountability in 
        other sectors of health, as well as the promotion of health 
        equity and more inclusive and productive societies.''.

SEC. 10003. HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Health impact assessment is a tool to help planners, 
        health officials, decision makers, and the public make more 
        informed decisions about the potential health effects of 
        proposed plans, policies, programs, and projects in order to 
        maximize health benefits and minimize harms.
            (2) Health impact assessments foster community leadership, 
        ownership, and participation in decision-making processes.
            (3) Health impact assessments can build community support 
        and reduce opposition to a project or policy, thereby 
        facilitating economic growth by aiding the development of 
        consensus regarding new development proposals.
            (4) Health impact assessments facilitate collaboration 
        across sectors.
    (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to--
            (1) provide more information about the potential human 
        health effects of policy decisions and the distribution of 
        those effects;
            (2) improve how health is considered in planning and 
        decision-making processes; and
            (3) build stronger, healthier communities through the use 
        of health impact assessments.
    (c) Health Impact Assessments.--Part P of title III of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280g et seq.), as amended by section 7254 
of this Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 399V-11. HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENTS.

    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:

        Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
            ``(2) Director.--The term `Director' means the Director of 
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
            ``(3) Health impact assessment.--The term `health impact 
        assessment' means a systematic process that uses an array of 
        data sources and analytic methods and considers input from 
        stakeholders to determine the potential effects of a proposed 
        policy, plan, program, or project on the health of a population 
        and the distribution of those effects within the population. 
        Such term includes identifying and recommending appropriate 
        actions on monitoring and maximizing potential benefits and 
        minimizing potential harms.
            ``(4) Health inequity.--The term `health inequity' means a 
        particular type of health difference that is closely linked 
        with social, economic, or environmental disadvantage and that 
        adversely affects groups of people who have systematically 
        experienced greater obstacles to health based on their racial 
        or ethnic group; religion; socioeconomic status; gender; age; 
        mental health; cognitive, sensory, or physical disability; 
        sexual orientation or gender identity; geographic location;

    (a) Findings; Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) There is a significant body of evidence showing 
                that economic and social conditions have a powerful 
                impact on individual and population health outcomes and 
                well-being, as well as medical costs.
                    (B) State, local, and Tribal governments and the 
                service delivery partners of such governments face 
                significant challenges in coordinating benefits and 
                services delivered through the Medicaid program and 
                other social services programs because of the 
                fragmented and complex nature of Federal and State 
                funding and administrative requirements.
                    (C) The Federal Government should prioritize and 
                proactively assist State and local governments to 
                strengthen the capacity of State and local governments 
                to improve health and social outcomes for individuals, 
                thereby improving cost-effectiveness and return on 
                investment.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are as follows:
                    (A) To establish effective, coordinated Federal 
                technical assistance to help State and local 
                governments to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness 
                of, and return on investment from, health and social 
                services programs.
                    (B) To build a pipeline of State and locally 
                designed, cross-sector interventions and strategies 
                that generate rigorous evidence about how to improve 
                health and social outcomes, and increase the cost-
                effectiveness of, and return on investment from, 
                Federal, State, local, and Tribal health and social 
                services programs.
                    (C) To enlist State and local governments and the 
                service providers of such governments as partners in 
                identifying Federal statutory, regulatory, and 
                administrative challenges in improving the health and 
                social outcomes of, cost-effectiveness of, and return 
                on investment from, Federal spending on individuals 
                enrolled in Medicaid.
                    (D) To develop strategies to improve health and 
                social outcomes without denying services to, or 
                restricting the eligibility of, vulnerable populations.

SEC. 10011. INVESTING IN COMMUNITY HEALING.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, African 
        Americans are more likely to have face-to-face contact with law 
        enforcement and are 2.5 times more likely to experience a 
        threat or use of nonfatal force by police.
            (2) Research shows that young men who have experienced 
        these law enforcement practices display higher levels of 
        stress, anxiety, and trauma associated with the interaction.
            (3) Witnessing or experiencing invasive encounters with law 
        enforcement can also be an everyday stressor for racial and 
        ethnic minorities, leading to physiological and psychological 
        strain.
            (4) Racial and ethnic minorities face inequities in 
        accessing mental health services.
            (5) Addressing the stigma in some communities of color 
        associated with receiving mental health services and informing 
        individuals about available treatment can encourage better 
        utilization of these services.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that it is 
imperative that a comprehensive public health approach to addressing 
trauma and mental health care be focused on care delivery that is 
culturally sensitive and competent.
    (c) Research on Adverse Health Effects Associated With Interactions 
With Law Enforcement.--
            (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services 
        (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting 
        through the Director of the Office of Minority Health of the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (established 
        pursuant to section 1707A of the Public Health Service Act (42 
        U.S.C. 300u-6a)), shall conduct research on the adverse health 
        effects associated with interactions with law enforcement.
            (2) Effects among racial and ethnic minorities.--The 
        research under paragraph (1) shall include research on--
                    (A) the health consequences, both individual and 
                community-wide, of trauma related to violence committed 
                by law enforcement among racial and ethnic minorities; 
                and
                    (B) the disproportionate burden of morbidity and 
                mortality associated with such trauma.
            (3) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall--
                    (A) complete the research under this subsection; 
                and
                    (B) submit to the Congress a report on the

                minorities who face obstacles to using more traditional 
                services and resources (such as obstacles in geographic 
                access to providers, insurance coverage, and access to

SEC. 10012. ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE MAPPING AND DATA COLLECTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) environmental hazards causing adverse health outcomes 
        have disproportionately affected environmental justice 
        communities as a result of systemic injustices relating to 
        factors that include race and income;
            (2) environmental justice communities have increased 
        vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change and need 
        significant investment to face current and future environmental 
        hazards;
            (3) the Federal Government has lacked a cohesive and 
        consistent strategy to carry out the responsibilities of 
        Federal agencies described in Executive Order 12898 (42 U.S.C. 
        4321 note; relating to Federal actions to address environmental 
        justice in minority populations and low-income populations);
            (4) it is necessary that the Federal Government 
        meaningfully engage environmental justice communities in the 
        process of developing a robust strategy to address 
        environmental justice, including high levels of review, input, 
        and consent;
            (5) there is a lack of nationwide high-quality data 
        relating to environmental justice concerns, such as 
        socioeconomic factors, air pollution, water pollution, soil 
        pollution, and public health, and a failure to update the 
        existing data with adequate frequency;
            (6) there is no nationally consistent method to identify 
        environmental justice communities based on the cumulative 
        effects of socioeconomic factors, pollution burden, and public 
        health;
            (7) a method described in paragraph (6) is needed to 
        correct for racist and unjust practices leading to historical 
        and current environmental injustices through the targeted 
        investment in environmental justice communities of at least 40 
        percent of the funds provided for a clean energy transition and 
        other related investments, including transportation 
        infrastructure, housing infrastructure, and water quality 
        infrastructure;
            (8) funds targeted for environmental justice communities 
        should include set-asides for technical assistance and capacity 
        building for environmental justice communities to access the 
        funds;
            (9) particular oversight and care are necessary when 
        investing in environmental justice communities to ensure that 
        existing issues are not exacerbated and new issues are not 
        created, particularly issues relating to pollution burden and 
        the displacement of residents;
            (10) several States, academic institutions, and nonprofit 
        organizations have engaged in cumulative impact environmental 
        justice mapping efforts that can serve as references for a 
        Federal mapping effort;
            (11) many environmental justice communities, such as 
        communities in ``Cancer Alley'' in the State of Louisiana, have 
        been clearly affected by extreme environmental hazards such 
        that the communities--
                    (A) are identifiable before the establishment of 
                the tool under paragraph (2) of subsection (d) and the 
                completion of the data gap audit under paragraph (4) of 
                that subsection; and
                    (B) should be eligible for programs targeted toward 
                environmental justice communities that have faced 
                extreme environmental hazards before the establishment 
                of that tool and the completion of that audit;
            (12) in addition to investment in environmental justice 
        communities, pollution reduction is essential to achieving 
        equitable access to a healthy and clean environment and an 
        equitable energy system; and
            (13) specific policy and permitting decisions and 
        investments may rely on different combinations of data sets and 
        indicators relating to environmental justice, and race alone 
        may be considered a criterion when assessing the susceptibility 
        of a community to environmental injustice.

                        are--
                                    (I) as small as practicable to 
                                identify communities; and
                                    (II) not larger than a census 
                                tract;
                            (vi) ensure that the tool is capable of 
                        providing maps of environmental justice 
                        communities based on environmental justice 
                        scores described in clause (v);
                            (vii) ensure that users of the tool are 
                        able to map available layers together or 
                        independently as desired;
                            (viii) implement a method for users of the 
                        tool to generate a map and environmental 
                        justice score based on a subset of indicators, 
                        particularly for the purpose of using the tool 
                        in addressing various policy needs, permitting 
                        processes, and investment goals;

                        specific policy needs, permitting processes, 
                        and investment goals;
                            (x) account for conditions that are not 
                        captured by the quantitative data used to 
                        develop the 1 or more maps and environmental 
                        justice scores comprising the tool, by--
                                    (I) developing and executing a plan 
                                to perform outreach to relevant 
                                communities; and
                                    (II) establishing a mechanism by 
                                which communities can self-identify as 
                                environmental justice communities to be 
                                included in the tool, which may include 
                                citing qualitative data on conditions 
                                for which quantitative data are 
                                lacking, such as cultural loss in 
                                Tribal communities;
                            (xi) consider that the tool--
                                    (I) will be used across the Federal 
                                Government in screening Federal 
                                policies, permitting processes, and 
                                investments for environmental and 
                                climate justice impacts; and
                                    (II) may be used to assess 
                                communities for pollution reduction 
                                programs; and
                            (xii) carry out such other activities as

SEC. 10013. ANTIRACISM IN PUBLIC HEALTH.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For centuries, structural racism, defined by the 
        National Museum of African American History and Culture as an 
        ``overarching system of racial bias across institutions and 
        society,'' in the United States has negatively affected 
        communities of color, especially Black, Latinx, Asian American, 
        Pacific Islander, and American Indian and Alaska Native people, 
        to expand and reinforce White supremacy.
            (2) Structural racism determines the conditions in which 
        people are born, grow, work, live, and age and determine 
        people's access to quality housing, education, food, 
        transportation, and political power, and other social 
        determinants of health.
            (3) Structural racism serves as a major barrier to 
        achieving health equity and eliminating racial and ethnic 
        inequities in health outcomes that exist at alarming rates and 
        are determined by a wider set of forces and systems.
            (4) Due to structural racism in the United States, people 
        of color are more likely to suffer from chronic health 
        conditions (such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma, hepatitis, 
        and hypertension) and infectious diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, 
        and COVID-19) compared to their White counterparts.
            (5) Due to structural racism in maternal health care in the 
        United States, Black and American Indian and Alaska Native 
        infants are more than twice as likely to die than White 
        infants, Black women are 3 to 4 times more likely to die from 
        pregnancy-related causes than White women, and American Indian 
        and Alaska Native women are 5 times more likely to die from 
        pregnancy-related causes than White women. This trend persists 
        even when adjusting for income and education.
            (6) Due to structural racism in the United States, Non-
        Hispanic Black women have the highest rates for 22 of 25 severe 
        morbidity indicators used by the Center for Disease Control and 
        Prevention (CDC).
            (7) Due to structural racism in the United States, people 
        of color comprise a disproportionate percentage of persons with 
        disabilities in the United States.
            (8) Due to structural racism in the United States, Black 
        men are up to three and a half times as likely to be killed by 
        police as White men, and 1 in every 1,000 Black men will die as 
        a result of police violence. Policing has adverse effects on 
        mental health in Black communities.
            (9) Due to the confluence of structural racism and factors 
        such as gender, class, and sexual orientation or gender 
        identity, commonly referred to as intersectionality, Black and 
        Latinx transgender women are more likely to die due to violence 
        and homicide than their White counterparts.
            (10) Due to structural racism, inequitable access to 
        quality health care and long-term services and supports also 
        disproportionately burdens communities of color; people of 
        color and immigrants are less likely to be insured and are more 
        likely to live in medically underserved areas.
            (11) Due to structural racism, older adults of color are 
        also more likely to be admitted to nursing homes and assisted 
        living facilities and to reside in those of poor quality, and 
        when older adults of color do receive home and community based 
        services, Medicaid spends less money on their services and they 
        are more likely to be hospitalized than older White adults.
            (12) In addition, the Federal Government's failure to honor 
        the unique political status of American Indian and Alaska 
        Native people, to respect the inherent sovereignty of Tribal 
        Nations, and to uphold its trust and treaty obligations to 
        Tribal Nations and American Indian and Alaska Native people, is 
        an ongoing and unjust manifestation of centuries of oppression, 
        with the consequence of adverse health outcomes for Native 
        peoples.
            (13) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the devastating 
        impact of structural racism on the United States ability to 
        ensure equitable health outcomes for people of color, and made 
        these communities more likely to suffer from severe outcomes 
        due to the coronavirus infection.
            (14) Racial and ethnic inequity in public health is a 
        result of systematic, personally mediated, and internalized 
        racism and racist public and private policies and practices, 
        and dismantling structural racism is integral to addressing 
        public health.

                interventions to reduce or eliminate uses of force by 
                law enforcement, including police brutality and 
                violence;
                    (E) coordinate with the Department of Justice, and 
                other Federal, State, and local agencies on the 
                standardization of data collection, storage, and 
                retrieval necessary to collect, evaluate, analyze, and 
                disseminate information about the extent and nature of 
                uses of force by law enforcement, including police 
                brutality and violence, as well as options for the 
                eradication of such practices;
                    (F) submit an annual report to Congress on research 
                findings with recommendations to improve data 
                collection and standardization and to disrupt processes 
                in policing that preserve and reinforce racism and 
                racial disparities in public health;
                    (G) conduct primary research and explore uses of 
                force by law enforcement, including police brutality 
                and violence, and options for its control; and
                    (H) study alternatives to law enforcement response 
                as a method of reducing police violence.

    (a) Findings; Purposes.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
                    (A) There is a significant body of evidence showing 
                that economic and social conditions have a powerful 
                impact on individual and population health outcomes and 
                well-being, as well as medical costs.
                    (B) State, local, and Tribal governments and the 
                service delivery partners of such governments face 
                significant challenges in coordinating benefits and 
                services delivered through the Medicaid program and 
                other social services programs because of the 
                fragmented and complex nature of Federal and State 
                funding and administrative requirements.
                    (C) The Federal Government should prioritize and 
                proactively assist State and local governments to 
                strengthen the capacity of State and local governments 
                to improve health and social outcomes for individuals, 
                thereby improving cost-effectiveness and return on 
                investment.
            (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are as follows:
                    (A) To establish effective, coordinated Federal 
                technical assistance to help State and local 
                governments to improve outcomes and cost-effectiveness 
                of, and return on investment from, health and social 
                services programs.
                    (B) To build a pipeline of State and locally 
                designed, cross-sector interventions and strategies 
                that generate rigorous evidence about how to improve 
                health and social outcomes, and increase the cost-
                effectiveness of, and return on investment from, 
                Federal, State, local, and Tribal health and social 
                services programs.
                    (C) To enlist State and local governments and the 
                service providers of such governments as partners in 
                identifying Federal statutory, regulatory, and 
                administrative challenges in improving the health and 
                social outcomes of, cost-effectiveness of, and return 
                on investment from, Federal spending on individuals 
                enrolled in Medicaid.
                    (D) To develop strategies to improve health and

SEC. 10016. IMPROVING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Healthy People 2030 defines social determinants of 
        health as conditions in the environments where people are born, 
        live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide 
        range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and 
        risks.
            (2) One of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2030 is 
        to ``create social, physical, and economic environments that 
        promote attaining the full potential for health and well-being 
        for all''.
            (3) Healthy People 2030 developed a ``place-based'' 
        organizing framework, reflecting five key areas of social 
        determinants of health namely--
                    (A) economic stability;
                    (B) education access and quality;
                    (C) social and community context;
                    (D) health care access and quality; and
                    (E) neighborhood and built environment.
            (4) It is estimated that medical care accounts for only 10 
        to 20 percent of the modifiable contributors to healthy 
        outcomes for a population.
            (5) The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has 
        indicated the importance of the social determinants in its work 
        stating that, ``As we seek to foster innovation, rethink rural 
        health, find solutions to the opioid epidemic, and continue to 
        put patients first, we need to take into account social 
        determinants of health and recognize their importance.''.
            (6) The Department of Health and Human Services' Public 
        Health 3.0 initiative recognizes the role of public health in 
        working across sectors on social determinants of health, as 
        well as the role of public health as chief health strategist in 
        communities.
            (7) Through its Health Impact in 5 Years initiative, the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has highlighted 
        nonclinical, community-wide approaches that show positive 
        health impacts, results within five years, and cost-
        effectiveness or cost-savings over the lifetime of the 
        population or earlier.
            (8) Health departments and the Centers for Disease Control 
        and Prevention are not funded for such cross-cutting work.
    (b) Social Determinants of Health Program.--
            (1) Program.--To the extent and in the amounts made

                activities of the Centers for Disease Control and 
                Prevention related to social determinants of health 
                with activities of other Federal agencies related to 
                social determinants of health, including such 
                activities of agencies in the Department of Health and 
                Human Services such as the Centers for Medicare & 
                Medicaid Services.
                    (E) Collecting and analyzing data related to the

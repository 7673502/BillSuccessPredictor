                                 A BILL


 
    To index the maximum value of Federal Pell Grants to inflation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pell Grant Sustainability Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 2009 through 2018, the maximum discretionary 
        Federal Pell Grants under section 401 of the Higher Education 
        Act of 1965 stayed flat while inflation was 17 percent.
            (2) The value of Federal Pell Grants must keep pace with 
        students' costs in order to fulfill their mission of enabling 
        lower-income students to attend college.

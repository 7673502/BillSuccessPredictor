                a process that enables an eligible out-of-State 
                provider to enroll as a provider in the State plan 
                without the imposition of additional screening 
                requirements by the State. An eligible out-of-State 
                provider that enrolls in the State plan through such 
                process shall be so enrolled for a 5-year period and 
                may revalidate such enrollment through such process for 
                subsequent 5-year periods.

                ``Enrollment,'' after ``Screening,''; and
                    (B) in paragraph (9), by striking ``Nothing'' and

            (3) Section 2107(e)(1)(G) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
        1397gg(e)(1)(G)) is amended by inserting ``enrollment,'' after

    (c) Effective Date.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), the 
        amendments made by this section take effect on January 1, 2022.
            (2) Exception for state legislation.--In the case of a 
        State plan under title XIX of the Social Security Act (42 
        U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) or a State child health plan under title 
        XXI of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.) which the Secretary 
        of Health and Human Services determines requires State 
        legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) in 
        order for the plan to meet the additional requirements imposed 
        by the amendments made by this section, such State plan or 
        State child health plan shall not be regarded as failing to 
        comply with the requirements of such title XIX or title XXI, 
        respectively, solely on the basis of its failure to meet these 
        additional requirements before the first day of the first 
        calendar quarter beginning after the close of the first regular 
        session of the State legislature that begins after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the previous 
        sentence, in the case of a State that has a 2-year legislative 
        session, each year of such session shall be deemed to be a 
        separate regular session of the State legislature.

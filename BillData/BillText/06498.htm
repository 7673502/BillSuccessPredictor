                                 A BILL


 
    To authorize music-related exchange programs facilitated by the 
 Department of State and relevant private sector partnerships, and for 
                            other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Peace, Education, And 
Cultural Exchange through Music Diplomacy Act'' or the ``PEACE through 
Music Diplomacy Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) music is an important conveyer of culture and can be 
        used to communicate values and build understanding between 
        communities;
            (2) music artists play a valuable role in cross-cultural 
        exchange, and their works and performances can promote 
        peacebuilding and conflict resolution efforts;
            (3) the music industry in the United States has made 
        important contributions to American society and culture, and 
        musicians and industry professionals in the United States can 
        offer valuable expertise to young music artists around the 
        world; and
            (4) the United States Government should promote exchange 
        programs, especially programs that leverage the expertise and 
        resources of the private sector, that give young music artists 
        from around the world the chance to improve their skills, share 
        ideas, learn about American culture, and develop the necessary 
        skills to support conflict resolution and peacebuilding efforts 
        in their communities and broader societies.

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF MUSIC-RELATED EXCHANGE PROGRAMS.

    The Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (commonly 
referred to as the Fulbright-Hays Act) is amended--
            (1) in section 102(a)(2) (22 U.S.C. 2452(a)(2))--
                    (A) in clause (iii), by striking ``assemblies;'' 
                and inserting ``assemblies; and''; and
                    (B) in clause (iv)--
                            (i) by inserting ``, including in 
                        coordination and consultation with the private 
                        sector,'' before ``similar''; and
                            (ii) by striking ``national interest.'' and 
                        inserting ``national interest; and''; and
            (2) in section 112(a) (22 U.S.C. 2460(a))--
                    (A) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' after the 
                semicolon at the end;
                    (B) in paragraph (9), by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``; and''; and
                    (C) by adding at the end the following new 
                paragraph:
            ``(10) exchange programs, including in coordination and 
        consultation with the private sector, focused on music and the 
        performing arts that provide opportunities for foreign 
        nationals and Americans to build cross-cultural understanding 
        and advance peace abroad.''.

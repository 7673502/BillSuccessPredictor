            ``(1) used by a service provider to provide fixed 
        terrestrial broadband service for which the service provider 
        receives universal service support under section 254 of the 
        Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 254), if--
                    ``(A) the broadband service satisfies the current 
                speed benchmark for fixed services established by the 
                Federal Communications Commission under section 706 of 
                the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. 1302); or
                    ``(B) the service provider is in compliance with 
                buildout obligations in the relevant area to provide 
                retail fixed terrestrial broadband service that will 
                comply with the applicable broadband speed standard 
                described in subparagraph (A); or
            ``(2) that--

                Secretary under this Act or any other program carried 
                out by the Secretary for the costs of the construction, 
                improvement, or acquisition of facilities or equipment 
                for the purpose of providing fixed terrestrial 
                telecommunications or broadband service; and
                    ``(B)(i) is used to provide fixed terrestrial 
                broadband service, if--
                            ``(I) the broadband service satisfies any 
                        applicable broadband speed standards 
                        established by the Secretary; or
                            ``(II) the service provider is in 
                        compliance with buildout obligations in the 
                        relevant area to provide retail fixed 
                        terrestrial broadband service that will comply 
                        with the applicable broadband speed standards 
                        described in subclause (I); or

                any other program carried out by the Secretary that 
                remains outstanding for the purpose of providing fixed 
                terrestrial telecommunications or broadband service.
    ``(b) Restriction on Use of Assistance.--A loan, grant, or other 
assistance awarded under this Act, or by the rural development mission 
area under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 
1921 et seq.), may not be used to coordinate, approve, or finance the 
deployment of broadband-capable infrastructure by a service provider to 
provide retail fixed broadband service that would overbuild or 
otherwise duplicate qualifying broadband-capable infrastructure that 
another service provider is using to provide retail fixed terrestrial 
broadband service in the same geographic area.
    ``(c) Use of Assistance in Unserved Areas.--A loan, grant, or other 
assistance provided by the Secretary hereunder, acting through the 
Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, to coordinate, approve, 
or finance the deployment of broadband-capable infrastructure by a 
service provider may be used to provide retail fixed broadband service 
only in a geographic area in which there is no qualifying broadband-
capable infrastructure owned or operated by another service 
provider.''.

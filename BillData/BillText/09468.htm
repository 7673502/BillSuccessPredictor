                1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973;
                    (C) to supersede, restrict, or limit the 
                application of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 
                1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; or
                    (D) to limit the authority of Federal agencies to 
                issue regulations pursuant to the Americans with 
                Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act of

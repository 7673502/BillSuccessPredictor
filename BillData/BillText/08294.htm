    (c) The authority under subsection (a) may be exercised only for 
those projects or activities that have obligated less than 10 percent 
of the amount made available for obligation as of October 1 of the 
current fiscal year, and shall be applied to projects within the same 
general geographic area within 25 miles for which the funding was 
designated, except that a State or territory may apply such authority 
to unexpended balances of funds from projects or activities the State 
or territory certifies have been closed and for which payments have 
been made under a final voucher.
    (d) The Secretary shall submit consolidated reports of the 
information provided by the States and territories annually to the

                project-based assistance budget authority.
            (2) The transferring project shall, as determined by the 
        Secretary, be either physically obsolete or economically 
        nonviable, or be reasonably expected to become economically 
        nonviable when complying with state or Federal requirements for 
        community integration and reduced concentration of individuals 
        with disabilities.
            (3) The receiving project or projects shall meet or exceed 
        applicable physical standards established by the Secretary.
            (4) The owner or mortgagor of the transferring project

        transferring project and provide a certification of approval by 
        all appropriate local governmental officials.
            (5) The tenants of the transferring project who remain 
        eligible for assistance to be provided by the receiving project 
        or projects shall not be required to vacate their units in the 
        transferring project or projects until new units in the 
        receiving project are available for occupancy.
            (6) The Secretary determines that this transfer is in the 
        best interest of the tenants.
            (7) If either the transferring project or the receiving 
        project or projects meets the condition specified in subsection 
        (d)(2)(A), any lien on the receiving project resulting from 
        additional financing obtained by the owner shall be subordinate 
        to any FHA-insured mortgage lien transferred to, or placed on, 
        such project by the Secretary, except that the Secretary may 
        waive this requirement upon determination that such a waiver is 
        necessary to facilitate the financing of acquisition, 
        construction, and/or rehabilitation of the receiving project or 
        projects.
            (8) If the transferring project meets the requirements of 
        subsection (d)(2), the owner or mortgagor of the receiving 
        project or projects shall execute and record either a 
        continuation of the existing use agreement or a new use 
        agreement for the project where, in either case, any use 
        restrictions in such agreement are of no lesser duration than 
        the existing use restrictions.
            (9) The transfer does not increase the cost (as defined in 
        section 502 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
        661a)) of any FHA-insured mortgage, except to the extent that

    Sec. 211.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in fiscal 
year 2023, in managing and disposing of any multifamily property that 
is owned or has a mortgage held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban

a contract for rental assistance payments under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or any other Federal 
programs, the Secretary shall maintain any rental assistance payments 
under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 and other 
programs that are attached to any dwelling units in the property. To 
the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the tenants 
and the local government that such a multifamily property owned or 
having a mortgage held by the Secretary is not feasible for continued 
rental assistance payments under such section 8 or other programs, 
based on consideration of (1) the costs of rehabilitating and operating 
the property and all available Federal, State, and local resources, 
including rent adjustments under section 524 of the Multifamily 
Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 (in this section 
``MAHRAA'') (42 U.S.C. 1437f note), and (2) environmental conditions 
that cannot be remedied in a cost-effective fashion, the Secretary may, 
in consultation with the tenants of that property, contract for 
project-based rental assistance payments with an owner or owners of 
other existing housing properties, or provide other rental assistance. 
The Secretary shall also take appropriate steps to ensure that project-
based contracts remain in effect prior to foreclosure, subject to the 
exercise of contractual abatement remedies to assist relocation of 
tenants for imminent major threats to health and safety after written 
notice to and informed consent of the affected tenants and use of other 
available remedies, such as partial abatements or receivership. After 
disposition of any multifamily property described in this section, the 
contract and allowable rent levels on such properties shall be subject 
to the requirements under section 524 of MAHRAA.
    Sec. 212.  Public housing agencies that own and operate 400 or 
fewer public housing units may elect to be exempt from any asset 
management requirement imposed by the Secretary in connection with the 
operating fund rule:  Provided, That an agency seeking a discontinuance

and in future Acts for the operation, capital improvement, and 
management of public housing as authorized by sections 9(d) and 9(e) of 
the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g(d),(e)), the 
Secretary shall not impose any requirement or guideline relating to 
asset management that restricts or limits in any way the use of capital 
funds for central office costs pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of 
section 9(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 
1437g(g)(1), (2)):  Provided, That a public housing agency may not use 
capital funds authorized under section 9(d) for activities that are 
eligible under section 9(e) for assistance with amounts from the 
operating fund in excess of the amounts permitted under paragraph (1) 
or (2) of section 9(g).
    Sec. 214.  No official or employee of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development shall be designated as an allotment holder unless the 
Office of the Chief Financial Officer has determined that such 
allotment holder has implemented an adequate system of funds control 
and has received training in funds control procedures and directives. 
The Chief Financial Officer shall ensure that there is a trained 
allotment holder for each HUD appropriation under the accounts 
``Executive Offices'', ``Administrative Support Offices'', ``Program 
Offices'', ``Government National Mortgage Association--Guarantees of 
Mortgage-Backed Securities Loan Guarantee Program Account'', and 
``Office of Inspector General'' within the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.
    Sec. 215.  The Secretary shall, for fiscal year 2023, notify the 
public through the Federal Register and other means, as determined 
appropriate, of the issuance of a notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) 
for any program or discretionary fund administered by the Secretary 
that is to be competitively awarded. Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, for fiscal year 2023, the Secretary may make the NOFO 
available only on the Internet at the appropriate Government website or 
through other electronic media, as determined by the Secretary.
    Sec. 216.  Payment of attorney fees in program-related litigation 
shall be paid from the individual program office and Office of General 
Counsel salaries and expenses appropriations.
    Sec. 217.  The Secretary is authorized to transfer up to 10 percent 
or $5,000,000, whichever is less, of funds appropriated for any office 
under the headings ``Administrative Support Offices'' or ``Program 
Offices'' to any other such office under such headings:  Provided, That 
no appropriation for any such office under such headings shall be 
increased or decreased by more than 10 percent or $5,000,000, whichever 
is less, without prior written approval of the House and Senate 
Committees on Appropriations:  Provided further, That the Secretary 
shall provide notification to such Committees 3 business days in 
advance of any such transfers under this section up to 10 percent or 
$5,000,000, whichever is less.
    Sec. 218. (a) Any entity receiving housing assistance payments 
shall maintain decent, safe, and sanitary conditions, as determined by 
the Secretary, and comply with any standards under applicable State or 
local laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations relating to the physical 
condition of any property covered under a housing assistance payment 
contract.
    (b) The Secretary shall take action under subsection (c) when a 
multifamily housing project with a contract under section 8 of the 
United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) or a contract for 
similar project-based assistance--
            (1) receives a Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS) 
        score of 59 or less; or
            (2) fails to certify in writing to the Secretary within 3 
        days that all Exigent Health and Safety deficiencies identified 
        by the inspector at the project have been corrected.
    Such requirements shall apply to insured and noninsured projects 
with assistance attached to the units under section 8 of the United 
States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), but shall not apply to 
such units assisted under section 8(o)(13) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 
1437f(o)(13)) or to public housing units assisted with capital or 
operating funds under section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 
1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437g).
    (c)(1) Within 15 days of the issuance of the Real Estate Assessment

results in a UPCS score of 60 or above, the Secretary may withdraw the 
Notice of Default.
    (2) At the end of the time period for correcting all deficiencies 
specified in the Notice of Default, if the owner fails to fully correct 
such deficiencies, the Secretary shall take one or more of the 
following actions, and provide additional notice of those actions to 
the owner and the parties specified above--
            (A) require immediate replacement of project management 
        with a management agent approved by the Secretary;
            (B) impose civil money penalties, which shall be used 
        solely for the purpose of supporting safe and sanitary 
        conditions at applicable properties, as designated by the 
        Secretary, with priority given to the tenants of the property 
        affected by the penalty;
            (C) abate the section 8 contract, including partial 
        abatement, as determined by the Secretary, until all 
        deficiencies have been corrected;
            (D) pursue transfer of the project to an owner, approved by

            (H) work with the owner, lender, or other related party to 
        stabilize the property in an attempt to preserve the property

        capital provided by a third-party that requires time to 
        effectuate; or
            (I) take any other regulatory or contractual remedies 
        available as deemed necessary and appropriate by the Secretary.
    (d) The Secretary shall take appropriate steps to ensure that 
project-based contracts remain in effect, subject to the exercise of

major threats to health and safety after written notice to and informed 
consent of the affected tenants and use of other remedies set forth 
above. To the extent the Secretary determines, in consultation with the 
tenants and the local government, that the property is not feasible for 
continued rental assistance payments under such section 8 or other

        and all available Federal, State, and local resources,

        actions being taken to address such conditions, including

award is announced by the Department or its offices:  Provided, That 
such notification shall list each grant award by State and 
congressional district.
    Sec. 221.  None of the funds made available in this Act shall be

condemnation or seizure, by a State, municipality, or any other 
political subdivision of a State.

the Continuum of Care (CoC) program as authorized under subtitle C of

to the availability of funds for such rent adjustments, to rent levels 
that are equal to the lesser of budget-based rents or comparable market 
rents for the market area at the request of an owner or purchaser who 
demonstrates that such rent adjustment is needed to address project 
health and safety deficiencies and that--

year 2017 are to remain available until expended for the liquidation of 
valid obligations incurred in fiscal years 2013 through 2017.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in the case of any 
grantee of funds referred to in subsection (a) of this section that 
provides assistance that duplicates benefits available to a person for 
the same purpose from another source, the grantee itself shall--
            (1) be subject to remedies for noncompliance; or
            (2) bear responsibility for absorbing such cost of 
        duplicative benefits and returning an amount equal to any 
        duplicative benefits paid to the grantee's funds available for 
        use under such heading, unless the Secretary, upon the request 
        of a grantee issues a public determination by publication in 
        the Federal Register that it is not in the best interest of the 
        Federal Government to pursue such remedies.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any grantee of 
funds referred to in subsection (a) of this section may request a 
waiver from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of any 
recoupment by the Secretary of such funds for amounts owed by persons 
who have received such assistance from such funds and who have been 
defrauded, or after receiving assistance, have filed for bankruptcy, 
gone through a foreclosure procedure on property that received such 
assistance, or are deceased. If the grantee self-certifies to the 
Secretary in such request that it has verified that the individual 
conditions of each person it is requesting a waiver for meets one of 
the conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the Secretary may 
grant such waivers on the basis of grantee self-certification, issue a 
public determination by publication in the Federal Register that it is 
not in the best interest of the Federal Government to pursue such 
recoupment, and may conduct oversight to verify grantee self-
certification and subject the grantee to remedies for noncompliance for 
any amounts that have not met such requirements.
    (d) Amounts repurposed pursuant to this section that were 
previously designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement 
pursuant to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 
1985 or a concurrent resolution on the budget are designated as an 
emergency requirement pursuant to section 4001(a)(1) of S. Con. Res. 14

Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6241), upon a determination by the 
President in this fiscal year that a regional supply shortage of

likely result from such shortage, and that a draw down and sale of 
refined petroleum product would assist directly and significantly in 
reducing the adverse impact of such shortage, the Secretary of Energy 
may draw down and sell refined petroleum product from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. Proceeds from a sale under this section shall be 
deposited into the SPR Petroleum Account established in section 167 of

demonstrations, exchanges, grants, incentives, leases, procurements, 
sales, other transaction authority, or other arrangements, to support 
the project or to obtain goods or services from the project:  Provided 
further, That the preceding proviso shall not be interpreted as 
precluding the use of the loan guarantee authority provided by this 
section for commitments to guarantee loans for: (1) projects as a 
result of such projects benefitting from otherwise allowable Federal 
income tax benefits; (2) projects as a result of such projects 
benefitting from being located on Federal land pursuant to a lease or 
right-of-way agreement for which all consideration for all uses is: (A) 
paid exclusively in cash; (B) deposited in the Treasury as offsetting 
receipts; and (C) equal to the fair market value as determined by the

initial award in fiscal year 2022 or later.
    (b) Upon vesting unconditional title pursuant to subsection (a) in 
an award recipient, subrecipient, or successor in interest other than 
the United States, the United States shall have no liabilities or 
obligations to the property.
    (c) For purposes of this section, the term ``property interest'' 
does not include any interest in intellectual property developed using 
funding provided under a project.
    Sec. 311.  None of the funds made available in this title may be 
used to support a grant allocation award, discretionary grant award, or 
cooperative agreement that exceeds $100,000,000 in Federal funding

_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Secretary of the Navy to close the Red Hill Bulk Fuel 
          Storage Facility in Hawaii, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Red Hill Watershed and Aquifer 
Initiative Act'' or the ``Red Hill WAI Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Red Hill Underground Fuel Storage Facility (in this 
        section referred to as the ``Red Hill facility'' ) was 
        constructed in September 1943.
            (2) The Red Hill facility was constructed underground in 
        hollowed-out volcanic rock to allow for maximum protection of 
        the fuel supply.
            (3) The Red Hill facility's 20 steel tanks are encased by 
        2.5 to 4 feet of concrete and surrounded by basalt bedrock.
            (4) The Red Hill facility is the largest single Department 
        of Defense fuel storage facility in the Pacific theater.
            (5) The Red Hill facility can store approximately 
        250,000,000 gallons of fuel. The fuels stored are marine 
        diesel, F-76, and two types of jet fuel: JP-5 and JP-8.
            (6) The Red Hill facility is located approximately 100 feet 
        above the basal groundwater table and sits directly above the 
        island of Oahu's federally designated sole-source groundwater 
        aquifer, the Southern Oahu Basal Aquifer, which provides 
        approximately 77 percent of Oahu's drinking water.
            (7) Historic records compiled by the Navy in a 2008 
        groundwater protection plan indicate that the Red Hill facility 
        has had dozens of fuel leaks dating back to 1947.
            (8) The Red Hill facility's fuel leaks pose an existential 
        threat to Oahu's federally designated sole-source groundwater 
        aquifer.
            (9) The Navy and the Defense Logistics Agency are 
        responsible for protecting the public from unscheduled fuel 
        leaks that may pose a risk to the drinking water.
            (10) Until the mid-1980s most underground storage tanks (in 
        this section referred to as ``USTs'') were made of bare steel, 
        which is likely to corrode over time and allow UST contents to 
        leak into the environment. The greatest potential hazard from a 
        leaking UST is that its contents (petroleum or other hazardous 
        substances) can seep into the soil and contaminate groundwater, 
        the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans.
            (11) To address a nationwide problem of leaking USTs, 
        Congress passed a series of laws to protect human health and 
        the environment, including the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the 
        Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act, the Energy Policy Act 
        of 2005, and the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act of 2009 
        (commonly referred to as the ``Recovery Act'').
            (12) The State of Hawaii obtained Environmental Protection 
        Agency State Program approval, effective on September 2, 2002, 
        for Hawaii's UST program to operate in lieu of the 
        Environmental Protection Agency UST program.
            (13) In January 2014, The Red Hill facility leaked 
        approximately 27,000 gallons of fuel.
            (14) In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 
        State of Hawaii Department of Health negotiated an enforceable 
        agreement, an Administrative Order on Consent, with the Navy 
        and the Defense Logistics Agency (EPA DKT NO. RCRA 7003-R9-
        2015-01/DOH DKT NO. 15-UST-EA-01).
            (15) The 2015 Administrative Order on Consent includes a 
        Statement of Work that lays out the specific tasks the Navy and 
        the Defense Logistics Agency must implement. The Statement of 
        Work consists of 8 sections on overall project management, as 
        follows:
                    (A) Tank inspection.
                    (B) Repair and maintenance.
                    (C) Tank upgrade alternatives.
                    (D) Release detection and tank tightness testing.
                    (E) Corrosion and metal fatigue practices.
                    (F) Investigation and remediation of releases.
                    (G) Groundwater protection and evaluation.
                    (H) Risk and vulnerability assessment.
            (16) On May 6, 2021, a burst pipeline in Red Hill spilled 
        fuel into the facility's lower access tunnel and the Navy 
        failed to recover the entirety of the leaked fuel. While the 
        Navy initially estimated that 1,618 gallons of fuel spilled, 
        with all but 38 gallons recovered, several months later, the 
        Navy's estimated amount of fuel spilled increased to 19,000 
        gallons, with most of the spilled fuel not recovered.
            (17) On November 20, 2021, the Navy announced a spill of 
        14,000 gallons of a water and fuel mixture from a fire 
        suppression drain line located 0.25 miles downhill of the fuel 
        tanks at Red Hill due to operator error.
            (18) On November 22, 2021, the Navy announced that the 
        water and fuel mixture was removed from the tunnel and put into 
        a storage tank above ground and that there were no signs that 
        the fuel had escaped into the environment. The Navy 
        communicated that the water was safe to drink.
            (19) On November 28, 2021, military families and civilians 
        living in the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam military housing 
        installation began reporting contaminated tap water.
            (20) Impacted families shared personal experiences of the 
        immediate and ongoing health impacts of exposure to the 
        contaminated water in their homes including chemical burns, 
        stomach and head pain, dizziness and nauseousness, rashes and 
        more.
            (21) Families reported noxious odors in impacted homes that 
        continued to make this housing unsuitable for many families.
            (22) After it was definitively confirmed that the Red Hill 
        well was contaminated with petroleum, the State of Hawaii 
        Department of Health issued an emergency order on December 6, 
        2021, to the United States Navy to suspend operations and 
        defuel the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. That emergency 
        order was contested by the Navy in late December, and on 
        January 3, 2022, it was reaffirmed by the State of Hawaii, 
        Department of Health in its final decision and order.
            (23) The December 6, 2021, emergency order has had broad 
        support from the communities of Oahu, the Governor, the 
        Department of Health, State Commission on Water Resource 
        Management, the City and County Board of Water Supply, city 
        council members, and State legislators. In short, the whole-of-
        government in Hawaii believes that the Navy should comply with 
        the emergency order.
            (24) On December 7, 2021 the Navy announced that they will 
        contest the State of Hawaii's order to drain the fuel tanks.
            (25) On December 10, 2021, the Navy confirmed samples taken 
        from the Navy Red Hill Shaft contained fuel levels 350 times 
        more than the State of Hawaii's safe drinking limit.
            (26) On February 2, 2022, the Department of Justice filed 
        an appeal in both Federal and State court over the State of 
        Hawaii's order to defuel Red Hill.

                                 A BILL


 
    To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Kyle H. Rittenhouse, who 
  protected the community of Kenosha, Wisconsin, during a Black Lives 
                 Matter (BLM) riot on August 25, 2020.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Kyle H. Rittenhouse Congressional 
Gold Medal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) Throughout the summer of 2020, local governments across 
        various cities and States failed to adequately protect 
        residents and their property from violent riots that included 
        arson, looting, and murder.
            (2) On August 25, 2020, a violent BLM riot broke out in 
        Kenosha, Wisconsin, putting tens of thousands of lives at risk 
        and leaving property vulnerable to destruction.
            (3) The courageous actions taken in response to the threat 
        to his community by Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from the 
        greater Kenosha area, went beyond the civilian call of duty.
            (4) Kyle Rittenhouse traveled to the site of the riot with 
        a medical kit to provide aid to those injured by the rioters; 
        he also carried a fire extinguisher to help put out fires at 
        various properties started by arsonists.
            (5) Kyle Rittenhouse disarmed a pistol-wielding individual 
        with a lengthy criminal record, including driving while 
        intoxicated and carrying a firearm while intoxicated.
            (6) Corporate media outlets including CNN, MSNBC, and the 
        Washington Post, and certain Members of Congress, unjustly 
        attacked Kyle Rittenhouse's character before his eventual 
        acquittal, a direct contradiction to the legal principle that a 
        person is presumed innocent until proven guilty.
            (7) On November 19, 2021, Kyle Rittenhouse was found ``not 
        guilty'' on all charges by a jury of his peers, rendering the 
        slanderous and libelous content of the aforementioned corporate 
        media and certain Members of Congress against him susceptible 
        to charges of defamation.

SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS.

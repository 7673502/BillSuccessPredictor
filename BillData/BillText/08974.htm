  To amend the Expedited Funds Availability Act to require that funds 
   deposited be available for withdrawal in real-time, and for other 
                               purposes.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Payments Modernization Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Families in the United States spend billions of dollars 
        in overdraft fees in part because they are waiting for checks 
        to clear over a weekend or holiday.
            (2) The inefficient payment system in the United States 
        drives families, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, 
        to use high-cost financial services to access funds more 
        rapidly.
            (3) A faster payment system would provide people of the 
        United States immediate access to funds and relief for those 
        who overdraw their accounts because their deposits are not 
        available in real-time, helping families potentially save 
        billions of dollars each year.
            (4) The United States lags behind other countries in the 
        speed and efficiency of its payment system.
            (5) Central banks around the world have already implemented 
        real-time payment systems, including in the United Kingdom, 
        Australia, Mexico, Poland, Japan, and South Africa.
            (6) The Federal Reserve System was created by Congress on 
        December 24, 1913, in response to the financial panic of 1907.
            (7) Since its beginning, the Federal Reserve System has 
        played a crucial role in the payment system of the United 
        States.
            (8) The role of the Federal Reserve System in providing 
        payment services is--
                    (A) to promote the integrity and efficiency of the 
                payment mechanism; and
                    (B) to ensure the provision of payment services to 
                all depository institutions on an equitable basis and 
                in an atmosphere of competitive fairness.
            (9) The Monetary Control Act of 1980 (title I of Public Law 
        96-221; 94 Stat. 132) provided the Board of Governors of the 
        Federal Reserve System with the authority to oversee the 
        payment system in the United States.
            (10) The Expedited Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4001 
        et seq.), enacted on August 10, 1987, provided the Board of 
        Governors of the Federal Reserve System with full authority to 
        regulate all aspects of the payment system, including the 
        receipt, payment, collection, clearing of checks, and related 
        functions of the payment system pertaining to checks.
            (11) In a July 2018 report on financial technology, the 
        Department of the Treasury acknowledged the important role of 
        the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in 
        bringing real-time payment settlement services to the United 
        States when the Department recommended the Board of Governors 
        work to facilitate a faster retail payment system, in 
        particular, for smaller financial institutions such as 
        community banks and credit unions, noting that such 
        institutions should also have the ability to access the most 
        innovative technologies and payment services.
            (12) The authorities described in paragraphs (9) and (10) 
        are more critical than ever given how the financial services 
        sector has been defined as a vital component of critical 
        infrastructure in the United States.
            (13) The role of the Board of Governors of the Federal 
        Reserve System in the financial services sector will ensure the 
        resiliency of the payment system in the United States.
            (14) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
        should develop a real-time interbank payment system to ensure 
        that--
                    (A) consumers are prioritized;
                    (B) consumers and small businesses are protected 
                from fraud and errors, including with respect to a 
                payment initiated by a consumer or small business;
                    (C) the payment system is open to increased 
                competition; and
                    (D) outsized entities do not monopolize the 
                financial infrastructure of the United States.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to ensure that the United States has a safe, fast, 
        efficient, equitable, and fair payment system;
            (2) to clarify that the Board of Governors of the Federal 
        Reserve System has the existing authority to build a real-time 
        payment system; and
            (3) to make certain that the Board of Governors of the 
        Federal Reserve System follows through on implementing the 
        system described in paragraph (2).

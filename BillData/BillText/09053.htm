                                 A BILL


 
To establish the Office for the Equitable, Transparent, and Accountable 
          Puerto Rico Reconstruction, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Community Driven Recovery for Puerto 
Rico Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Recovery from the devastation caused by natural 
        disasters should be agile, effective, and promote resiliency 
        for future disasters. Other priorities include promoting 
        accountability and transparency in the use of Federal funds 
        that will be spent in these efforts and implementing mechanisms 
        to ensure those ends.
            (2) The current systems of the agencies in charge of 
        recovery in Puerto Rico are over-centralized and do not serve 
        the purpose of agile and effective planning and implementation 
        or of effective monitoring and accounting.
            (3) The centralized system of Federal recovery spending for 
        Puerto Rico excludes most communities from program design and 
        program implementation prioritization, does not take advantage 
        of the local historical and institutional knowledge on the use 
        of Federal recovery funds, and is not as flexible and 
        responsive as the local implementation network.
            (4) An Office for Equitable, Transparent, and Accountable 
        Puerto Rico Reconstruction should be established so that 
        diverse civil society leaders in Puerto Rico are in positions 
        to help ensure equitable, effective, transparent, and 
        accountable recovery and development of Puerto Rico.
            (5) The work of the Office for Equitable, Transparent, and 
        Accountable Puerto Rico Reconstruction should be guided by the 
        following principles:
                    (A) Equitable and resilient recovery and 
                development that is responsive to under-served 
                populations and vulnerable groups as well as applies 
                innovative and sustainable investments.
                    (B) An empowered civil society in Puerto Rico that 
                does not substitute State or local government, but that 
                is protected from abuse and that can participate in the 
                decision making processes through effective 
                participation mechanisms, as through their local 
                organizations and government representatives.
                    (C) Effective and agile spending of Federal funds 
                for the recovery and long-term resiliency of families, 
                communities, municipalities, and local Puerto Rican 
                businesses and organizations.
                    (D) Accountability of those executing and 
                implementing plans and programs, and transparency 
                before the Federal Government and the people from 
                Puerto Rico.
                    (E) Recovery efforts that feed on local knowledge 
                and visions on how to rebuild the island.
                    (F) A regional approach to mitigation and 
                adaptation through the coordination of Federal, State, 
                local, and community efforts.

                the Task Force, who will be the leader and spokesperson

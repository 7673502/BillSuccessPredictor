 To establish the Cesar E. Chavez and the Farmworker Movement National 
Historical Park in the States of California and Arizona, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Cesar E. Chavez and the Farmworker 
Movement National Historical Park Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Cesar E. Chavez National Monument was established 
        by Presidential Proclamation 8884 on October 8, 2012, for the 
        purposes of protecting and interpreting the nationally 
        significant resources associated with the property in Keene, 
        California, known as ``Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz''.
            (2) Nuestra Senora Reina de la Paz--
                    (A) served as the national headquarters of the 
                United Farm Workers; and
                    (B) was the home and workplace of Cesar E. Chavez, 
                the family of Cesar E. Chavez, union members, and 
                supporters of Cesar E. Chavez.
            (3) While the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument marks the 
        extraordinary achievements and contributions to the history of 
        the United States by Cesar Chavez and the farmworker movement, 
        there are other significant sites in the States that are 
        important to the story of the farmworker movement.
            (4) In the study conducted by the National Park Service 
        entitled ``Cesar Chavez Special Resource Study and 
        Environmental Assessment'' and submitted to Congress on October 
        24, 2013, the National Park Service--
                    (A)(i) found that several sites associated with 
                Cesar E. Chavez and the farmworker movement--
                            (I) are suitable for inclusion in the 
                        National Park System; and
                            (II) depict a distinct and important aspect 
                        of the history of the United States not 
                        otherwise adequately represented at existing 
                        units of the National Park System; and
                    (ii) recommended that Congress establish a national 
                historical park to honor the role that Cesar E. Chavez 
                played in lifting up the lives of farmworkers; and
                    (B)(i) found that the route of the 1966 march from 
                Delano to Sacramento, California--
                            (I) is eligible for National Historic 
                        Landmark status; and
                            (II) meets the criteria for designation as 
                        a national historic trail; and
                    (ii) recommended that the National Park Service 
                work with partner organizations and agencies to provide 
                for interpretation programs along the route of the 1966 
                march from Delano to Sacramento, California.
    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to establish the Cesar E. 
Chavez and the Farmworker Movement National Historical Park--
            (1) to help preserve, protect, and interpret the nationally 
        significant resources associated with Cesar Chavez and the 
        farmworker movement;
            (2) to interpret and provide for a broader understanding of 
        the extraordinary achievements and contributions to the history 
        of the United States made by Cesar Chavez and the farmworker 
        movement; and
            (3) to support and enhance the network of sites and 
        resources associated with Cesar Chavez and the farmworker 
        movement.

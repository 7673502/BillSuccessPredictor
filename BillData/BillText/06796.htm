                date of the enactment of this Act) by 5 percent or

            (14) Hosting service.--The term ``hosting service'' means 
        an interactive computer service that--
                    (A) stores information provided by, and at the

                        this subparagraph shall apply, or cease to 
                        apply, beginning on the date that is 4 months 
                        after the publication of the designation on, or 
                        the removal of the designation from, the list

                appropriate.
            (3) Considerations.--In issuing regulations under paragraph

        requirements--
                    (A) take into consideration the rights and 
                interests of providers and users of hosting services, 
                including the protection of personal information, the 
                protection of confidential information, and maintaining 
                the security of such services;
                    (B) specify how providers of hosting services 
                should count and communicate their methods for counting 
                content moderation actions, including in the case that 
                content spans multiple reasons for removal or repeated 
                notifications related to the same user or content;
                    (C) specify when and how posts moderated by 
                volunteer moderators in a hosted community should be 
                reported;
                    (D) take into consideration relevant standards 
                issued by international standards-setting 
                organizations; and
                    (E) require the reports to be machine-readable and 
                formatted to allow access by users with disabilities.
            (4) Frequency.--In issuing regulations under paragraph (1), 
        the Commission shall specify the frequency with which a 
        provider of a hosting service is required to issue the 
        transparency reports required by such regulations and may vary 
        such frequency under subsection (e) based on the size and scope 
        of the service or the provider. The Commission shall require 
        such reports to be issued at least annually for hosting 
        services and at least quarterly for large covered platforms.
    (c) Level of Detail of Required Disclosures.--In issuing 
regulations under this section, the Commission shall consider the level 
of detail needed to inform users of hosting services while not impeding 
the ability of hosting services to mitigate systemic risks, including 
the systemic risks described in section 4(a)(3).
    (d) Language of Required Disclosures.--In issuing regulations under 
this section, the Commission shall require a provider of a hosting 
service to make available the information required to be included in 
the community standards of the provider under subsection (a) and the

different requirements for different services such as social media 
services, online marketplaces, augmented reality and virtual reality 
services, digital advertising placement services, and cloud and web 
hosting services.
    (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
to require a provider of a hosting service to collect personal 
information that the provider would not otherwise collect.

            (5) Frequency.--In issuing regulations under paragraph (1), 
        the Commission shall specify the frequency with which a 
        provider of a large covered platform is required to conduct the

SEC. 8. GUIDANCE ON BEST PRACTICES.

    (a) In General.--The Commission shall, on an ongoing basis, issue a 
series of evidence-based nonbinding guidance on best practices for 
providers of large covered platforms to address the systemic risks 
described in section 4(a)(3). The guidance shall focus on product 
design features and content moderation processes that aim to be content 
neutral.
    (b) Registry.--The Commission shall maintain, and make publicly 
available on the website of the Commission, a registry of all large 
covered platforms with a list of the guidance issued under this section 
that each platform follows, according to the independent audits 
conducted under section 7(c) or other information provided to the 
Commission under this Act.
    (c) Advisory Committees.--The Commission may create advisory 
committees (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Advisory Committee 
Act (5 U.S.C. App.)) to solicit views regarding the guidance under this 
section from stakeholders, including communities most impacted by the 
systemic risks described in section 4(a)(3) and content moderators and 
employees (current or former) at covered platforms focused on 
mitigating such risks.

SEC. 9. RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue regulations under 
section 553 of title 5, United States Code, that require a provider of 
a large covered platform that uses a recommender system to do the 
following:
            (1) To specify in the terms and conditions of the provider, 
        in a clear, accessible, and easily comprehensible manner--
                    (A) the most salient features, inputs, or 
                parameters used by the recommender system;
                    (B) how any personal information used by the 
                recommender system is collected or inferred about a 
                user of the platform, and the categories of such 
                information (including demographic, behavioral, and any 
                other categories defined by the Commission); and
                    (C) any options that the provider makes available 
                for a user of the platform to modify the profile of the 
                user or to influence the features, inputs, or 
                parameters used by the recommender system.
            (2) To provide an option that does not rely on any of the 
        user's personal information (either collected or inferred) to 
        determine the order of information presented to the user. The 
        Commission may determine reasonable exceptions to ensure 
        product functionality, such as the user's language preference 
        or recognized place. Such option shall be set as a default or 
        presented prominently within the main interface containing the 
        results of the recommender system. The provider shall present 
        the options in good faith, and avoid misleading or harassing 
        consumers into making different choices, failing to maintain 
        parity of unrelated features, or other measures as determined 
        by the Commission.
    (b) Opt-In for Certain Personal Information.--In issuing 
regulations under subsection (a), the Commission may determine that 
certain personal information may not be used to customize a recommender 
system without specific opt-in consent from users. In the case of such 
a determination, a provider of a large covered platform shall 
independently obtain opt-in consent for separate categories of personal 
information (as categorized and according to standards set by the 
Commission) rather than obtaining a global opt-in consent for all 
personal information or multiple categories of personal information 
simultaneously.
    (c) Considerations for Rulemaking.--In issuing regulations under 
subsection (a), the Commission shall consider--
            (1) the ways recommender systems may be used to help 
        providers of large covered platforms mitigate systemic risks 
        described in section 4(a)(3);
            (2) the frequency with which recommendation algorithms are 
        trained; and
            (3) the technical feasibility of disabling or modifying use 
        of features, inputs, or parameters for each user.
    (d) Variation Based on Size and Scope of Platform and Type of 
Recommender System.--In issuing regulations under subsection (a), the 
Commission shall vary the requirements based on the size and scope of 
the large covered platform, including by having different requirements 
and for different types of recommender systems.

SEC. 10. INDEPENDENT RESEARCH FACILITATION.

    (a) Office of Independent Research Facilitation.--In establishing 
the Bureau under section 3(a), the Commission shall establish within 
the Bureau an office to be known as the ``Office of Independent 
Research Facilitation'', which shall carry out such duties of the 
Commission under this section, and such other duties relating to 
facilitation of independent research on covered platforms, as the 
Commission considers appropriate.
    (b) Researcher Certification Process.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue 
        regulations under section 553 of title 5, United States Code, 
        to establish a process by which--
                    (A) an organization may, upon application to the 
                Commission, be qualified as a host organization; and
                    (B) an individual who is affiliated with a host 
                organization may, upon application to the Commission, 
                be certified in order to obtain access to information 
                under this section for the purposes described in 
                paragraph (2).
            (2) Purposes of access to information.--The purposes 
        described in this paragraph are to gain understanding and 
        measure the impacts of the content moderation, product design 
        decisions, and algorithms of covered platforms on society, 
        politics, the spread of hate, harassment, and extremism, 
        security, privacy, and physical and mental health.

        organization.--
                    (A) In general.--In order to be qualified as a host

                articles and video clips), including the demographic 
                breakdown of users that interact with content (to the 
                extent such breakdown is known or inferred) and the 
                source of exposure (such as organic search or

                platforms and certified researchers.
                    (B) Consortium required.--A Federally Funded 
                Research and Development Center sponsored by the 
                Commission under subparagraph (A) shall be comprised of

                    (C) Mission.--The mission of a Federally Funded 
                Research and Development Center sponsored by the 
                Commission under subparagraph (A) may include the 
                following:
                            (i) Enabling certified researchers to 
                        perform studies requiring information from 
                        multiple covered platforms.
                            (ii) Serving as a means to provide 
                        certified researchers access to information as

        marketplaces, augmented reality and virtual reality services, 
        and digital advertising placement services. In the case of a 
        large covered platform, the regulations issued under paragraph

            (9) Safe harbor for providers.--If a provider of a covered 
        platform provides a certified researcher with access to 
        information in accordance with the regulations required by 
        paragraph (1) (regardless of whether such access is optional or

                        carried out for the purposes described in 
                        subsection (b)(2), if--

                                creation and use of the account or 
                                accounts; and
                                    (II) the creation and use of the 
                                account or accounts does not materially 
                                burden the technical operation of the 
                                covered platform.

                provider of a covered platform may not condition, 
                degrade, or otherwise discriminate in the provision of 
                a service or product to a certified researcher because

        may be meaningful to a certified researcher, including the 
        meaning, relationship to other information, origin, and format 
        of the information; and
            (2) establish a process by which the Commission will 
        consult a data dictionary submitted under paragraph (1) in

                for which the piece of content is required to remain 
                available, in the high-reach public content stream, 
                with the goal of providing a near real-time 
                understanding of high-reach and high-engagement public 
                content on the platform.
                    (C) What constitutes a public high-profile account, 
                considering not only that the profile is set to public

                users.
                    (D) Any other matters the Commission considers

        provider of a large covered platform is not required to collect 
        any information about users for the high-reach public content 
        stream that the provider does not collect in the ordinary

        paragraph (1) may require a provider of a large covered 
        platform to make available to the public a version of the high-

        Such regulations may specify that such public version is not 
        required to contain certain information required to be included 
        in the version to which the Commission and certified 
        researchers are granted access because of national security or 
        privacy concerns.

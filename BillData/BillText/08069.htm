            ``(1) Existing stocks and further use.--The Administrator 
        shall permit the continued sale and use of a pesticide whose 
        registration is suspended or canceled under this section, or 
        section 3 or 4, or vacated through a court order for a period 
        of not less than 5 years after the date on which such

            (1) glyphosate has been used safely in United States 
        agriculture for decades;
            (2) glyphosate is one of the most studied herbicides in the 
        world and tens of thousands of studies have been conducted that 
        lead to a scientifically sound consensus that glyphosate is not 
        a carcinogen;
            (3) food security is national security and glyphosate is a 
        necessary tool in ensuring a safe and secure food supply in the 
        United States;
            (4) the existing preemption of State law specified in 
        section 24(b) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and 
        Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136v(b)) expressly preempts any 
        additional warning label requirement by any State for a 
        glyphosate-related product; and
            (5) the amicus curiae brief submitted by the Solicitor 
        General to the Supreme Court of the United States on May 10, 
        2022, related to 997 F.3d 941 (9th Cir. 2021) is fatally flawed 
        in its legal reasoning and is in direct conflict with the 
        statutory language as well as Congressional intent.
    (c) Regulations.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency shall promulgate final regulations making a 
determination specifying that any label of a pesticide product that 
contains glyphosate that is registered under section 3 of the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a) shall not 
contain a cancer warning.

SEC. 6. REINSTATEMENT OF RULE DEFINING WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES.

    The final rule entitled ``The Navigable Waters Protection Rule: 
Definition of `Waters of the United States''' and published in the 
Federal Register by the Environmental Protection Agency on April 21, 
2020 (85 Fed. Reg. 22250 et seq.), shall take effect on the date of the 
enactment of this Act.

        publicly available on the website of the Department of 
        Agriculture and by publication in the Federal Register.

a proposed rule issued under the Packers and Stockyards Act, 1921 (7 
U.S.C. 181 et seq.), including rules related to--
            (1) transparency in poultry grower contracting and 
        tournaments;
            (2) unfair practices and undue preferences under such Act; 
        and
            (3) the scope of violations under such Act with respect to 
        a showing of harm or likely harm to competition.

SEC. 8. APPROVAL OF USE OF PHOSPHOGYPSUM IN GOVERNMENT ROAD PROJECTS.

    The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall 
issue an approval of the use of phosphogypsum in government road 
projects that is identical to the approval issued in the notice titled

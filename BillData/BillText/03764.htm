Federal agency shall comply with the following requirements:
            (1) Notification.--Such Federal agency shall notify the 
        Administrator of such proposed agency action.
            (2) Determination of adverse impact.--The Federal agency, 
        in consultation with the Administrator, and subject to public 
        comment, shall determine whether the proposed agency action 
        will cause an adverse impact on the carbon storage, carbon 
        sequestration, ecosystem, or habitat of a blue carbon area of 
        significance.
            (3) Alternative.--With respect to any proposed action the 
        Administrator determines will have an adverse impact under 
        paragraph (2), the proposing agency, in consultation with the 
        Administrator, shall determine whether there is an alternative 
        action that would prevent such adverse impact and fulfill the 
        purpose of the proposed action. The proposing agency shall not 
        take an action that would cause an adverse impact if an 
        alternative that would not cause such adverse impact is 
        available and would fulfill the purpose of such action.
            (4) Carbon storage offsets.--With respect to a proposed 
        action for which the agency determines no alternative is 
        available under paragraph (3), the proposing agency shall--

                determines necessary to create a coastal or marine blue 
                carbon ecosystem storage offset that, taken in 
                conjunction with the proposed action, results in a long 
                term net increase in carbon storage, lasting an 
                equivalent time period as the carbon storage lost by 
                the adverse impact;
                    (C) demonstrate quantitatively, using the best 
                available science, that the carbon storage offset will 
                result in a net increase in ecological carbon storage 
                and is located in close proximity to the original site 
                to keep the affected communities whole;
                    (D) maintain such carbon storage offset for a 
                period of time to be determined by the Administrator 
                but not less than 100 years; and
                    (E) publish the agency's proposed course of 
                mitigation in the Federal Register for public notice 
                and comment.

for a new authorization or appropriation from a Federal agency 
transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget shall include, if 
such authorization or appropriation may affect a blue carbon area of 
significance, a certification that such agency will use such 
authorization or appropriation in compliance with this section.
    (i) Required Restrictions.--A Federal agency may not enter into a 
lease, easement, right-of-way, or sale of any land designated as a blue 
carbon area of significance unless such agency attaches appropriate 
restrictions to the use of the property to protect the blue carbon area 
of significance.
    (j) Exception.--Preparation, revision, implementation, or 
enforcement of a fishery management plan or its implementing 
regulations under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and 
Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.) that applies to an area that is

                 Subtitle B--Offshore Renewable Energy

SEC. 211. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF OFFSHORE 
              WIND ENERGY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States should aggressively reduce greenhouse 
        gas emissions from United States public lands and oceans and 
        strive to achieve net-zero emissions as soon as possible;
            (2) the United States can and must address this climate 
        crisis by putting Americans to work building the necessary 
        infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions;
            (3) the United States offshore wind resources must be 
        responsibly harnessed in order to both rapidly reduce our 
        carbon emissions and put people back to work while minimizing 
        impacts to the fishing industry; and
            (4) achieving the goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind 
        energy capacity by 2030 is anticipated to result in the 
        creation of tens of thousands of living wage, family supporting 
        union jobs while positioning America to lead a clean energy 
        revolution and tackle the climate crisis.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should rapidly develop its offshore 
        wind resources as a key part of achieving a national goal of 
        net-zero emissions;
            (2) offshore wind lease areas should be determined by a 
        robust and transparent stakeholder process that incorporates 
        early engagement and input from diverse user groups as well as 
        Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments;
            (3) development of offshore wind resources must ensure 
        ecosystem health and the protection of threatened and 
        endangered species and their habitats; and
            (4) permitting agencies must have sufficient resources to 
        carry out a robust and efficient review and permitting process.

TITLE III--CLIMATE-READY FISHERIES, EFFICIENT FISHERY VESSELS, AND BUY 
                            AMERICAN SEAFOOD

SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) American wild-caught seafood is integral to the 
        Nation's food supply and to American food security;
            (2) the seafood supply chain is often long and complex;
            (3) American-caught and American-processed seafood 
        especially from small-scale fishery operations, can be a 
        sustainable healthy source of protein and micronutrients;
            (4) fresh, frozen, dried, and canned domestic seafood can 
        be produced, processed, packaged, and transported in a manner 
        that has a low-carbon footprint;
            (5) marine species that are small, at lower trophic levels, 
        and pelagic typically have the smallest carbon footprint; and
            (6) therefore, any executive agency that purchases seafood 
        products should, to the extent practicable, buy local American-
        caught or American-harvested and American-processed seafood 
        products from fisheries that are not overfished or experiencing 
        overfishing, in order to support sustainable local seafood 
        businesses, reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with the 
        seafood product supply chain, and reduce dependence on imported 
        seafood products.

              PACIFIC COAST, INCLUDING PACIFIC TERRITORIES AND FREELY 
              ASSOCIATED STATES.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section, the following definitions apply:
            (1) Pacific territories and freely associated states.--The 
        term ``Pacific Territories and Freely Associated States'' means 
        each of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern 
        Mariana Islands, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the 
        Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau.
            (2) Undeveloped coastal barrier.--The term ``undeveloped 
        coastal barrier'' has the meaning given the term in section 3 
        of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3502).
    (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior shall prepare and 
submit a report to Congress on ways to integrate the Pacific Coast of 
the United States, including in the Pacific Territories and Freely 
Associated States into the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources 
System.
    (c) Consultation.--The Secretary shall prepare the report required 
under subsection (b)--
            (1) in consultation with the Governors of the affected 
        States, Pacific Territories, and Freely Associated States; and
            (2) after providing an opportunity for the submission and 
        consideration of public comments.
    (d) Contents.--The report required under subsection (b) shall--
            (1) examine the potential for loss of human life and damage 
        to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources, and the 
        potential for the wasteful expenditure of Federal revenues 
        along the Pacific Coast, giving particular attention to 
        tsunami, flood, erosion, and storm damage, and sea level rise 
        impacts;
            (2) consider the biophysical processes needed to maintain 
        habitat functions and coastal resiliency, accounting for 
        climate and land-use change; and
            (3) evaluate ways in which the definition of the term 
        ``undeveloped coastal barrier'' under section 3 of the Coastal 
        Barrier Resources Act (16 U.S.C. 3502) could be expanded to 
        more accurately address the geology and functions of coastal 
        barriers in areas along the Pacific Coast, including in the 
        Pacific Territories and Freely Associated States, including the 
        ways in which coastal bluffs, rocky outcroppings, beaches, 
        wetlands, estuaries, coral reefs, mangroves, and other 
        landforms in such areas function as coastal barriers by 
        absorbing storm impacts, protecting inland communities from sea 
        level rise impacts, providing habitat, and being subject to 
        erosion.
    (e) Preparation and Submission of Maps.--
            (1) Preparation.--As soon as practicable after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prepare maps 
        identifying the boundaries of those undeveloped coastal 
        barriers of the United States along the Pacific Coast, 
        including in the Pacific Territories and Freely Associated 
        States.
            (2) Submission to congress.--Not later than three years 
        after the date of submission of the report under subsection 
        (b), the Secretary shall submit to Congress maps identifying 
        the boundaries of those undeveloped coastal barriers of the 
        United States along the Pacific Coast, including the Pacific 
        Territories and Freely Associated States, that the Secretary 
        considers to be appropriate for inclusion in the John H. Chafee 
        Coastal Barrier Resources System.

        grant under this section, or a qualified holder designated by 
        that coastal State under subsection (g), shall provide matching 
        funds in an amount equal to at least 25 percent of the total 
        cost of the project carried out with the grant. As a condition 
        of receipt of a grant under this section, the Secretary shall 
        require that a coastal State provide to the Secretary such 
        assurances as the Secretary determines are sufficient to 
        demonstrate that the share of the cost of each eligible project 
        that is not funded by the grant awarded under this section has 
        been secured.
            ``(2) Waiver.--The Secretary may waive the application of 
        paragraph (1) for any qualified holder that is an underserved 
        community, a community that has an inability to draw on other 
        sources of funding because of the small population or low 
        income of the community, or for other reasons the Secretary 
        considers appropriate.
            ``(3) In-kind contributions.--A local community designated 
        as a qualified holder under subsection (g) may use funds or 
        other in-kind contributions donated by a nongovernmental 
        partner to satisfy the matching funds requirement under this 
        subsection.
            ``(4) Funding from other federal source.--If financial 
        assistance under this section represents only a portion of the 
        total cost of a project, funding from other Federal sources may 
        be applied to the cost of the project.
            ``(5) Value of a working waterfront.--The Secretary shall 
        treat as non-Federal match the value of a working waterfront or 
        interest in a working waterfront, including conservation and 
        other easements, that is held in perpetuity by a qualified 
        holder, if the working waterfront or interest is identified in 
        the application for the grant and acquired by the qualified 
        holder not later than three years of the grant award date, or 
        not later than three years after the submission of the 
        application and before the end of the grant award period. Such 
        value shall be determined by an appraisal performed at such 
        time before the award of the grant as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate.
            ``(6) Other considerations.--The Secretary shall treat as 
        non-Federal match the costs associated with acquisition of a 
        working waterfront or an interest in a working waterfront, and 
        the costs of restoration, enhancement, or other improvement to 
        a working waterfront, if the activities are identified in the 
        project application and the costs are incurred within the 
        period of the grant award, or, for working waterfront described 
        in paragraph (6), within the same time limits described in that 
        paragraph. Such costs may include either cash or in-kind 
        contributions.

funds made available to the Secretary under this section may be used by 
the Secretary for planning or administration of the program under this

TITLE VIII--INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS, EFFORTS IN THE ARCTIC, AND BUREAU 
              OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TRIBAL RESILIENCE PROGRAM

                  Subtitle A--International Agreements

SEC. 801. LAW OF THE SEA CONVENTION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) As a party to the Law of the Sea Convention, the United 
        States would be a powerful voting Council member of the 
        International Seabed Authority, a body that is critical to 
        negotiations regarding deep seabed mining, which is a practice 
        that could have significant potential climate, environmental, 
        and economic impacts.
            (2) Being party to the Convention and holding membership on 
        the International Seabed Authority is in the United States' 
        best interests in regard to competition with other countries 
        over future rare earth element resources found on the sea 
        floor.
            (3) Without being party to the Convention, the United 
        States cannot play a role in negotiating and providing 
        international legitimacy to claims to the Arctic, an area that 
        is rapidly becoming more accessible due to climate change.
            (4) As a party to the Convention, the United States would 
        be better able to participate in negotiations regarding the 
        management of high seas fish stocks, migratory fish stocks, and 
        marine mammals, which will become more important as the climate 
        continues to change and species shift.
            (5) The Convention imposes minimum requirements for ocean 
        protections; the United States is already meeting or exceeding 
        those requirements and could therefore positively influence 
        international marine conservation by being party to the 
        Convention.
            (6) A diverse array of bipartisan Presidents and lawmakers, 
        military leaders, industry stakeholders, and environmental 
        organizations support ratification of the Convention, finding 
        that it is in the United States' best economic, political, and 
        environmental interest to ratify.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States Senate should give its advice and 
        consent to accession to the Law of the Sea Convention, adopted 
        by the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea in 
        December 1982 and entered into force in November 1994, to 
        establish a treaty regime to govern activities on, over, and 
        under the world's oceans;
            (2) the Law of the Sea Convention builds on four 1958 Law 
        of the Sea conventions to which the United States is a party, 
        namely--
                    (A) the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the 
                Contiguous Zone;
                    (B) the Convention on the High Seas;
                    (C) the Convention on the Continental Shelf; and
                    (D) the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of 
                the Living Resources of the High Seas;
            (3) the Law of the Sea Convention and an associated 1994 
        agreement relating to implementation of the treaty were 
        transmitted to the Senate on October 6, 1994;
            (4) in the absence of advice and consent from the Senate, 
        the United States is not a party to the Convention nor to the 
        associated 1994 agreement;
            (5) becoming a party to the Law of the Sea Convention would 
        give the United States standing to participate in discussions 
        relating to the treaty and thereby improve the ability of the 
        United States to intervene as a full party in disputes relating 
        to navigational rights and defend United States interpretations 
        of the treaty's provisions; and
            (6) becoming a party to the treaty would improve the 
        ability of the United States to achieve the environmental, 
        social, and economic purposes of supporting the implementation 
        and enforcement of international fisheries agreements and the 
        protection of highly migratory species under the Magnuson 
        Stevens Act, the Shark Conservation Act, and the High Seas 
        Driftnet Fishing Moratorium Protection Act.

        made progress toward achieving the targets of the 14th 
        Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations (relating to 
        conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas, and marine 
        resources); and
            (2) plans for future United States actions to achieve those 
        targets.

the enactment of this Act, the Chair shall submit a report to Congress 
recommending key elements of a Strategic Climate Change Relocation 
Program to identify and assist communities that have expressed 
affirmative interest in relocation due to health, safety, and 
environmental impacts from climate change. The report shall--
            (1) identify--
                    (A) areas where climate change impacts make 
                relocation a likely climate change adaptation strategy;
                    (B) communities that have expressed affirmative 
                interest in relocation (in this section referred to as 
                ``sending communities''); and
                    (C) potential relocation areas and communities that 
                have expressed interest in attracting climate migrants 
                (in this section referred to as ``receiving 
                communities'');
            (2) propose criteria to qualify for climate relocation 
        assistance, with preference given to disadvantaged communities 
        where community members have indicated a preference for retreat 
        which would otherwise be challenged to relocate;
            (3) describe the roles and responsibilities of specific 
        Federal agencies in implementing the Strategic Climate Change 
        Relocation Program and how the Program should be coordinated 
        with applicable State and Federal agency plans and programs and 
        identify Federal programs that can be tailored to incentivize 
        self-identification of communities as receiving areas;
            (4) outline the role that State, Tribal, Indigenous, and 
        local governments should play in implementing the Strategic 
        Climate Change Relocation Program, including identification of 
        areas or communities where people leaving areas vulnerable to 
        climate change can consider locating, and the specific 
        resources needed to prepare those communities to be receiving 
        communities in terms of Federal investment in infrastructure, 
        affordable housing, and social services;
            (5) summarize existing Federal and State programs for 
        purchase of individual properties vulnerable to the impacts of 
        climate change and propose how these programs might be 
        restructured, improved, or expanded to incentivize climate 
        change relocation;
            (6) describe measures that governments or other 
        organizations can take to reduce the psychological stress 
        associated with relocation to preserve or support the 
        historical and cultural identity of communities being relocated 
        and to restore and conserve areas that are relocated from as 
        publicly accessible natural assets, and how Federal programs 
        will support these efforts;
            (7) identify and recommend measures to overcome how 
        institutional barriers, such as Federal programs that do not 
        account for Tribal sovereignty, constrain Tribal communities' 
        ability to pursue self-determined management of their resources 
        and built environment;
            (8) identify measures that Congress, Federal agencies, or 
        State and local governments should take to discourage or 
        restrict new development or redevelopment and hard structural 
        measures in areas vulnerable to such significant climate change 
        impacts that they are likely to require a solution that 
        includes relocation, in particular, where the Federal 
        Government could establish stricter funding requirements for 
        postdisaster funding that require updated building codes and 
        land use strategies reflecting climate risk;
            (9) describe existing policies and clarify responsibilities 
        of governments in complying with obligations to maintain public 
        infrastructure and to protect private property, including 
        providing just compensation for any taking of private property;
            (10) propose an application process, available online, and 
        in hardcopy, for States, Tribes, and communities to express 
        affirmative interest in climate relocation assistance, either 
        as a leaving community or receiving community;
            (11) provide guidance on and identify additional funding 
        for re-use planning and operations and maintenance requirements 
        for vacated land, and identify the resources needed to 
        prioritize public access, recreational and sustainable tourism 
        spaces, or conservation areas;
            (12) review efficacy of existing flood mitigation 
        strategies on reducing flood risk to human populations, and 
        identify opportunities to coordinate blue-green infrastructure 
        solutions with buyout programs that increase the resilience of 
        remaining residents; and
            (13) outline the amount and timing of Federal funding that 
        is expected to be needed to implement the Climate Change 
        Relocation Program.
    (f) Development of Report to Congress.--In developing the report 
required under subsection (e), the Chair shall--
            (1) provide for public review and comment of a draft of the 
        report;
            (2) solicit feedback from organizations representing State 
        and local governments;
            (3) engage in consultation with Indian Tribes;
            (4) engage in review by the external advisory panel; and
            (5) evaluate projects implemented under the National 
        Disaster Resilience Competition administered by the Department 
        of Housing and Urban Development.
    (g) Climate Change Strategic Relocation Program Pilot Projects.--

SEC. 1202. QUIET SEAS AND CLEAR SKIES VESSEL SPEED REDUCTION AWARD 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:
            (1) 49 marine mammal species are considered depleted under 
        the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and of those species, 
        42 are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
        Species Act of 1973.
            (2) Climate change is altering marine mammal migration 
        routes and timing.
            (3) Hundreds of threatened and endangered marine mammals, 
        including North Atlantic right whales and blue whales, die from 
        vessel strikes each year.
            (4) Background ambient noise levels have increased 
        significantly since the 1950s and can be attributed to vessel 
        noise, impeding foraging, breeding, communication, and other 
        behaviors of marine animals, including of threatened species 
        and endangered species.
            (5) Slower ship speeds reduce the lethality of vessel 
        strikes on marine life, moderate underwater noise, and provide 
        climate benefits through reduced fuel consumption and lower 
        particulate emissions.
            (6) In 2019, the Vessel Speed Reduction Program in the 
        Santa Barbara Channel region and the San Francisco Bay region 
        saved over 17,000 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, with 
        349 vessels from 15 different companies slowing their speeds 
        for over 99,000 nautical miles.
    (b) Establishment.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the 
Administrator of the EPA and Commandant of the United States Coast 
Guard, shall establish the Quiet Seas and Clear Skies Program (in this 
section referred to as the ``Program'') to--
            (1) reduce air pollution, harmful underwater vessel noise, 
        and the risk of fatal marine mammal ship strikes by encouraging 
        voluntary reduction in the speed of eligible vessels operating 
        within the Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States; and
            (2) annually award Quiet Seas and Clear Skies Excellence 
        Awards under subsection (d) for verified successful 
        participation in, and cooperation with, the Program by shipping 
        companies.
    (c) Program Requirements.--The Administrator shall develop and

        Commandant of the Coast Guard, and input from shipping 
        companies and experts in air quality and marine mammal 
        conservation, prescribe maximum speeds for eligible vessels 
        participating in the Program, except when directed by the Coast 
        Guard to proceed in excess of the speed requirements of the 
        Program for safety purposes, that would--
                    (A) obtain a significant reduction in greenhouse 
                gas and particulate pollution, including black carbon 
                emissions from eligible vessels;
                    (B) protect marine life; and
                    (C) reduce noise generated by eligible vessels.

            (1) require participation in the Program; or
            (2) authorize any action that affects navigational rights 
        and freedoms under international law or navigational safety.
    (g) Definition of Eligible Vessel.--In this section, the term 
``eligible vessel'' means a vessel greater than or equal to 65 feet in 
overall length.
    (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Administrator to carry out this section $4,000,000 
for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026.

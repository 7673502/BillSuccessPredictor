SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Sepsis Data Research, 
Outcomes, and Innovation Act'' or ``LuLu's Law''.

SEC. 2. TREATING AND ELIMINATING THE BURDEN OF SEPSIS.

    Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.

        that sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a 
        dysregulated host response to infection. Such definition shall 
        be standardized across departments, agencies, and other 
        entities within the Department of Health of Human Services.
            ``(2) Nationally notifiable disease.--The Secretary, acting 
        through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, shall take such steps as may be necessary to 
        include sepsis on the list of nationally notifiable diseases

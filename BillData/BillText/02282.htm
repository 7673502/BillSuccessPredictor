                                 A BILL


 
  To repeal certain impediments to the administration of the firearms 
                                 laws.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Records Restoration and 
Preservation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds as follows:
            (1) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of 
        valuable information, and the establishment of effective 
        policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes.
            (2) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun 
        laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed 
        within 24 hours, and by barring the Federal Government from 
        requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops.
            (3) A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg 
        School of Public Health found that the Tiahrt Amendments 
        dramatically increased gun trafficking to the criminal market.
            (4) A 2016 study from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate 
        School of Public Health found that in 2008, 79 percent of all 
        guns recovered by police from crime scenes belonged to someone 
        other than the perpetrator--30 percent had been stolen.
            (5) Every year, more than 123,000 Americans are shot.
            (6) 2020 was one of the deadliest years on record for the 
        United States, with an estimated 19,300 people killed in 
        firearm homicides or non-suicide related shootings, which is a 
        25-percent increase over 2019.
            (7) In 2019, 58.9 percent of firearm homicide victims were 
        Black and 15.9 percent of firearm homicide victims were 
        Hispanic.
            (8) In 2019, the National Tracing Center at the Bureau of 
        Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives processed 450,000 
        trace requests on firearms from Federal, State, and local law 
        enforcement.
            (9) Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun 
        trafficking makes our families and communities safer.
            (10) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law 
        enforcement efforts and give the public vital information 
        needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal 
        guns.

                coverage that are under common ownership (in whole or 
                part) with group health plans, health insurance 
                issuers, or entities providing pharmacy benefit 
                management services or pharmacy benefit administrative 
                services under group health plan or group or individual 
                health insurance coverage receive reimbursement that is 
                greater than the median price charged to the group 
                health plan or health insurance issuer when the same 
                drug is dispensed to enrollees in the plan or coverage 
                by other pharmacies included in the pharmacy network of 
                that plan, issuer, or entity that are not wholly or 
                partially owned by the health insurance issuer or 
                entity providing pharmacy benefit management services.
            (2) Requirement.--The Comptroller General of the United 
        States shall ensure that the report under paragraph (1) does 
        not contain information that would allow a reader to identify a 
        specific plan or entity providing pharmacy benefits management 
        services or otherwise contain commercial or financial 
        information that is privileged or confidential.
            (3) Definitions.--In this subsection, the terms ``group 
        health plan'', ``health insurance coverage'', and ``health 
        insurance issuer'' have the meanings given such terms in 
        section 2791 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg-
        91).

unless such allocation or requirement is consistent with statute, 
regulation, or other Federal law.

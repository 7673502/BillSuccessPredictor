                                 A BILL


 
  To provide access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water on Tribal 
                     lands, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Access to Clean Water Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water is an 
        essential human need and critical to the public health, well-
        being, educational attainment, and economic development of all 
        communities in the United States;
            (2) many countries, along with the United Nations, have 
        recognized the urgency of the need to access reliable, clean, 
        and drinkable water by passing laws or resolutions relating to 
        the human right to water and sanitation, including--
                    (A) recognizing these water and sanitation needs 
                exist among Indigenous peoples; and
                    (B) establishing aggressive targets for achieving 
                universal access to those basic services;
            (3) in the United States, access to reliable, clean, and 
        drinkable water has long been a significant problem in many 
        Native communities, such that nearly half of all households in 
        those communities do not have access to reliable water sources, 
        clean drinking water, or basic sanitation, and are 
        significantly more likely than White households to lack indoor 
        plumbing;
            (4) the trust responsibility of the Federal Government to 
        Indian Tribes requires the Federal Government to ensure the 
        survival and welfare of Indian Tribes, and the failure to 
        provide basic water service cannot be reconciled with that 
        trust responsibility;
            (5) the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had a 
        disproportionate impact on Native communities due to a 
        multitude of factors, including--
                    (A) persistent economic disadvantages;
                    (B) racial inequity; and
                    (C) lack of public health infrastructure, including 
                access to running water;
            (6) on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued Executive 
        Order 14008 (86 Fed. Reg. 7619 (February 1, 2021)), which 
        provides that it is the policy of the Biden Administration to 
        secure environmental justice and spur economic opportunity for 
        disadvantaged communities that have been historically 
        marginalized and overburdened by pollution and underinvestment 
        in housing, transportation, water and wastewater 
        infrastructure, and health care;
            (7) through the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and 
        Jobs Act (IIJA), H.R. 3684, Congress has provided funding for 
        the Indian Health Service and the Environmental Protection 
        Agency to support the construction and repair of Tribal clean 
        water infrastructure but no funding has yet been provided to 
        assist Tribes with operation and maintenance of water 
        infrastructure and such funding is necessary to protect the 
        historic investment in this infrastructure and to offset 
        Tribes' inability to access funding sources relied upon by most 
        municipal water providers;
            (8) technical assistance to Tribes is also necessary to 
        ensure that they are able to access and take advantage of the 
        new construction funding made available through the IIJA, that 
        they develop the managerial, financial, and regulatory 
        framework necessary for a fully functional and self-sustaining 
        utility, and that they are able to engage appropriate outside 
        consultants to assist as needed;
            (9) advances in water technology, including treatment, 
        sensors, and innovative pipeline materials, can assist in--
                    (A) accelerating efforts to provide universal 
                access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water for all 
                Native communities; and
                    (B) enhancing resilience in the face of climate 
                change;
            (10) the COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder that 
        access to reliable, clean, and drinkable water to support basic 
        hygiene is a matter of life or death for all individuals in the 
        United States;
            (11) it is in the interest of the United States, and it is 
        the policy of the United States, that all existing Native 
        communities be provided with safe and adequate water supply 
        systems as soon as practicable; and
            (12) both appropriate funding at the level of unmet need 
        and a ``whole of government'' approach among all Federal 
        agencies are essential to provide a meaningful solution to the 
        lack of access to clean water on Tribal lands.

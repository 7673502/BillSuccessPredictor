_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
   To create a Council on Emergency Response Protocols to ensure the 
 establishment of accessible, developmentally appropriate, culturally 
   aware, and trauma-informed emergency response protocols in public 
 schools, early child care and education settings, and institutions of 
               higher education, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Responsible Emergency 
Protocols for All Students Act'' or the ``PREP for All Students Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The lack of accessible, developmentally appropriate, 
        culturally aware, and trauma-informed emergency response 
        protocols for children and youth in public schools, early child 
        care and education settings, and institutions of higher 
        education is not a trivial issue:
                    (A) In 2016, there were 12,032,000 children from 
                ages 3 to 5 enrolled in preprimary education programs, 
                and almost one-quarter of children under the age of 5 
                are in some form of child care arrangement, including 
                nurseries, child care centers, and preschools.
                    (B) In the 2017-2018 school year--
                            (i) 14 percent of students in grades 
                        kindergarten through grade 12 had a disability; 
                        and
                            (ii) 11 percent of students in 
                        postbaccalaureate programs self-identified as 
                        having a disability.
            (2) As of the date of enactment of this Act, little has 
        been done to integrate specific populations, such as children 
        and youth at various developmental stages or children and youth 
        with disabilities, into emergency preparedness planning.
            (3) In 2018 alone, there were 108 natural disasters in the 
        United States, including severe thunderstorms, floods, 
        wildfires, droughts, earthquakes, and other extreme weather.
            (4) During the 16 academic years from 2000 through 2015, 
        there were 85 fatal fires in dormitories, fraternities, 
        sororities, and off-campus housing, resulting in 118 
        fatalities--an average of approximately 7 per school year.
            (5) The risks associated with natural and manmade disasters 
        have a disproportionate impact on individuals with 
        disabilities. People with disabilities are 2 to 4 times more 
        likely to die or sustain critical injuries during a disaster 
        than people without disabilities.
            (6) Technology plays an increasingly vital role in 
        emergency communications but remains largely inaccessible for 
        many individuals with disabilities.
            (7) The rise of gun violence and gun violence-related 
        deaths has contributed to the expansion of school security 
        technologies and devices. While such technologies and devices 
        have the potential to save lives, they have largely been 
        developed without consideration of the needs of students at 
        various developmental stages or students with disabilities. 
        Thus, there may be inherent biases within these technologies 
        and devices that disadvantage or create bias toward specific 
        populations.
            (8) As of the date of enactment of this Act, 92 percent of 
        schools nationwide have an active shooter lockdown protocol. 
        More than 1,000,000 elementary-age children experienced a 
        lockdown in the 2017-2018 school year, and among that group, at 
        least 220,000 were in kindergarten or prekindergarten.
            (9) While the Department of Homeland Security active 
        shooter emergency guidelines recommend that students and 
        personnel in school and early child care and education settings 
        ``Run, Hide, and Fight'', these strategies can exacerbate 
        danger for young children in prekindergarten and child care 
        centers, and can exclude and put at risk students with a wide 
        range of disabilities.
            (10) At the height of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) 
        pandemic, emergency closures of early education centers, 
        elementary schools, secondary schools, and institutions of 
        higher education created great disruptions in learning and cast 
        a light on educational institutions' lack of preparedness 
        protocols for public health emergencies.
            (11) During the pandemic, early care and education remains 
        indispensable for the development of children and for millions 
        of health care workers, first responders, educators, and 
        essential personnel, and it is imperative that early care and 
        education centers and schools have emergency preparedness plans 
        to ensure the safety of students and educators.
            (12) Emergency preparation drills and real-life lockdowns 
        where danger may be external can create undue stress, fear, and 
        trauma in children, youth, employees, and other specific 
        populations in schools, early child care and education 
        settings, and institutions of higher education.
            (13) Traumatic events have a long-lasting and profound 
        sensory impact on young children, as birth to age 5 is a 
        critical developmental age. Frightening visual stimuli, loud 
        noises, violent movements, and other sensations associated with 
        an unpredictable frightening event, such as in an emergency 
        preparation drill or lockdown, can cause substantial stress. 
        Unlike older children, young children cannot express in words 
        whether they feel afraid, overwhelmed, or helpless, and may 
        have difficulty regulating their behavior and emotions after 
        experiencing trauma.
            (14) There is an increasing need to ensure the 
        establishment of accessible, developmentally appropriate, 
        culturally aware, and trauma-informed emergency response 
        protocols, including gun violence response and prevention 
        protocols, natural disaster preparedness procedures, fire 
        drills, and other emergency preparation drills or lockdown 
        procedures, in public schools, early child care and education 
        settings, and institutions of higher education.

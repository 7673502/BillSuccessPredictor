SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF CERTAIN DRUG CARTELS AS FOREIGN 
              TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that each of

designation as a foreign terrorist organization as set forth in section 
219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189).
    (b) Designation.--The Secretary of State shall designate each of 
the following Mexican drug cartels as a foreign terrorist organization 
under such section 219:
            (1) The Reynosa/Los Metros faction of the Gulf Cartel.
            (2) The Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date

                    (A) a detailed report on each of the drug cartels 
                listed in section (2)(b) and any other cartels the 
                Secretary may identify, including the criteria met for 
                designation as a foreign terrorist organization as set 
                forth in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality 
                Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
                    (B) for each of the cartels designated under 
                subsection (b), if the Secretary determines that the 
                drug cartel does not meet the criteria set forth under 
                such section 219, a detailed justification as to which 
                criteria have not been met.
            (2) Designation of additional cartels.--Not later than 30 
        days after the submission of the report the Secretary shall 
        designate any cartel or any faction thereof as a foreign 
        terrorist organization listed in the report that met the 
        criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist organization as 
        set forth in section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act 
        (8 U.S.C. 1189).

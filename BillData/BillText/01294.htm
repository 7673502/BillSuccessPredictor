      To amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to prohibit the 
 participation of foreign entities in the administration of elections 
                          for Federal office.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign-Free 
Elections Act''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--

        citizens, it is unacceptable to have any foreign participation 
        in these elections; and
            (2) elections in the United States should be carried out 
        with the highest degree of integrity and safeguards to ensure 
        legality and United States control, in order to prevent the 
        disenfranchisement of legal voters.

SEC. 2. PROHIBITING PARTICIPATION OF FOREIGN ENTITIES IN ADMINISTRATION 
              OF FEDERAL ELECTIONS.

    ``(b) Role of Nonprofit Organizations.--A nonprofit organization

        1938, as amended (22 U.S.C. 611(b));
            ``(3) any partnership, association, corporation, or other

such Act (52 U.S.C. 21111) is amended by striking ``and 303'' and 
inserting ``303, and 304''.

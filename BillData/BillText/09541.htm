                petition is filed or joined by the owner of the 
                technical measure proposed to be designated or whose

        respect to each proposed technical measure, the Register, in 
        making a recommendation under paragraph (3), shall consider 
        whether the criteria set forth in subsection (c)(1)(A) have 
        been met, and, in addition, shall take into account--

                notices received by the service provider pursuant to 
                section 512, taking into consideration the scale of the 
                platform and existing systems to identify or protect

                service providers should be exempt from the subset of 
                service providers covered by the proposed technical 
                measure, such as corporate or not-for-profit websites 
                that permit user comments or posts, but have never or 
                rarely had infringing activity on their services;

        recommendation on each proposed technical measure, and each 
        proposed revision or rescinding of a previous designation of a 
        technical measure, that is considered under the rulemaking 
        process under this subsection, and after consulting with the

                                 A BILL


 
To address the psychological, social, and emotional needs of racial and 
ethnic minorities who experience trauma associated with law enforcement 
                   violence, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Investing in Community Healing Act 
of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, African 
        Americans are more likely to have face-to-face contact with law 
        enforcement and are 2.5 times more likely to experience a 
        threat or use of nonfatal force by police.
            (2) Research shows that young men who have experienced 
        these law enforcement practices display higher levels of 
        stress, anxiety, and trauma associated with the interaction.
            (3) Witnessing or experiencing invasive encounters with law 
        enforcement can also be an everyday stressor for racial and 
        ethnic minorities, leading to physiological and psychological 
        strain.
            (4) Racial and ethnic minorities face inequities in 
        accessing mental health services.
            (5) Addressing the stigma in some communities of color 
        associated with receiving mental health services and informing 
        individuals about available treatment can encourage better 
        utilization of these services.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that it is imperative that a 
comprehensive public health approach to addressing trauma and mental 
health care be focused on care delivery that is culturally sensitive 
and competent.

SEC. 4. RESEARCH ON ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERACTIONS 
              WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in 
this Act referred to as the ``Secretary''), acting through the Director

health effects associated with interactions with law enforcement.
    (b) Effects Among Racial and Ethnic Minorities.--The research under 
subsection (a) shall include research on--
            (1) the health consequences, both individual and community-
        wide, of trauma related to violence committed by law 
        enforcement among racial and ethnic minorities; and
            (2) the disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality 
        associated with such trauma.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Secretary shall--
            (1) complete the research under this section; and

        and the Navajo Tribe of Indians provides for the education of 
        the citizens of the Navajo Nation.
            (2) The Navajo Nation created and chartered the Navajo 
        Community College by Resolution CN-95-68 as a wholly owned 
        educational entity of the Navajo Nation.
            (3) In 1971, Congress enacted the Navajo Community College 
        Act (Public Law 92-189; 25 U.S.C. 640a et seq.).
            (4) The Navajo Nation officially changed the name of the 
        Navajo Community College to the Dine College by Resolution CAP-
        35-97.
            (5) The purpose of the Dine College is to provide 
        educational opportunities to the Navajo people and others in 
        areas important to the economic and social development of the 
        Navajo Nation.
            (6) The educational philosophy of the Dine College is to 
        apply principles of Sa'ah Naaghai Bik'eh Hozhoon (Dine

        training of the mind and heart.
            (7) The United States has a trust and treaty responsibility

        opportunities for Navajo people.
            (8) Significant portions of the Dine College's 
        infrastructure are dilapidated and pose a serious health and 
        safety risk to students, employees, and the public.
            (9) This Act is consistent with Executive Order 13592 (76 
        Fed. Reg. 76603, relating to improving American Indian and 
        Alaska Native educational opportunities and strengthening

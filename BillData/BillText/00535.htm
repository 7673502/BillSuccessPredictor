                    ``(A) In general.--If a portion of any excess 
                amount described in subsection (a)(3) is paid to a 
                State, the State shall allocate at least 5 percent of 
                such portion for distributing payments to special 
                districts in the State that submit to the Governor of 
                the State or the entity designated by the Governor to 
                distribute such payments (referred to in this paragraph 
                as the `designated payment entity') a request for a 
                payment during the COVID-19 emergency and information

                designated payment entity has determined, on the basis 
                of a good faith effort, is accurate.

                has experienced or is likely to experience during the 
                COVID-19 emergency--

                        district during the COVID-19 emergency and the 
                        need of the special district to supplement 
                        projected revenue.

                        district shall not exceed the amount of 
                        expenditures made by the special district for 
                        any quarter of calendar year 2019.

                        Infrastructure Security Agency of the 
                        Department of Homeland Security), the amount 
                        paid to the special district may exceed the 
                        limit applicable under clause (ii).
                            ``(iv) Rule of construction.--Nothing in 
                        the preceding clauses of this subparagraph 
                        shall be construed as requiring payment of an 
                        amount sufficient to provide a special district 
                        with full operational funding during the COVID-
                        19 emergency.

                is determined that a payment made to a special district 
                did not comply with the requirements of the preceding 
                subparagraphs, or was otherwise fraudulent or improper, 
                the special district shall be liable for the debt owed 
                to the Federal Government under subsection (f), unless 
                all or a part of the basis for such determination is 
                that the determination required under subparagraph (A) 
                regarding the accuracy of the information demonstrating 
                the need for the payment was not made in good faith, in

                not later than 60 days after the State receives a 
                payment from any excess amount described in subsection 
                (a)(3).

                paragraph, the term `COVID-19 emergency' means the 
                public health emergency declared by the Secretary of 
                Health and Human Services pursuant to section 319 of

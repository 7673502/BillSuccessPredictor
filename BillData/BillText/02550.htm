To require GAO review of certain TSA screening protocols, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Traveling Parents Screening 
Consistency Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL REVIEW.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a review of 
the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) implementation of 
the Bottles and Breastfeeding Equipment Screening Act (Public Law 114-
293), as well as the effectiveness of TSA in ensuring screening 
protocol clarity and screening consistency relating to the screening of 
formula, breast milk, purified deionized water for infants, and juice. 
Such review shall include the following:
            (1) Consider whether TSA effectively manages consistency of 
        screening protocol applications for formula, breastmilk, 
        purified deionized water for infants, and juice.
            (2) Evaluate the need for TSA to update and revise 
        procedures for such screening.
            (3) Assess whether TSA effectively tracks passenger 
        complaints related to such screening to monitor trends and 
        identify inconsistencies.
            (4) Evaluate TSA's communications and information sharing 
        practices for passengers, air carriers, and airports relating 
        to screening protocols for such screening.
            (5) Evaluate TSA's policies regarding the screening of 
        passengers with nursing products, including the extent to which 
        such passengers are more likely to receive secondary screening.
            (6) Make recommendations for improving TSA's overall 
        screening practices relating to such screening.
                                 &lt;all&gt;

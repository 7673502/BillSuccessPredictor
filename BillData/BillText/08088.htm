SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) India is the second most populous country in the world 
        with a population of approximately 1,334,000,000 people and is 
        the fifth largest economy in the world with a nominal gross 
        domestic product of approximately $2,940,000,000,000.
            (2) India is among the countries most vulnerable to climate 
        change, with hundreds of millions of people susceptible to 
        events exacerbated by climate change, such as the spread of 
        infectious diseases, sea level rise and extreme flooding, 
        droughts, storms, and landslides triggered by extreme weather.
            (3) India releases approximately 2,500,000,000 tons (carbon 
        dioxide equivalent) of greenhouse gases annually, making it the 
        third largest greenhouse gas emitter after the People's 
        Republic of China and the United States.
            (4) India is one of the largest energy markets in the world 
        and is projected to be the largest source of global energy 
        demand growth through 2040. Installed power capacity in India 
        more than doubled between 2011 and 2021.
            (5) Per capita energy consumption in India is relatively 
        low among emerging economic powers.
            (6) Reliable access to power is crucial for the storage of 
        vaccines and antiretroviral and other lifesaving medical drugs, 
        as well as for the operation of modern lifesaving medical 
        equipment.
            (7) Access to power can also provide improved information 
        and communication technologies that can greatly improve health 
        and education outcomes, as well as economic and commercial 
        opportunities.
            (8) In 2000, only 43 percent of the population of India had 
        access to power. That percentage more than doubled between 2000 
        and 2020, with approximately 700,000,000 people in India 
        gaining access to electricity during that period.
            (9) Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritized improving 
        citizen access to electricity and electrifying every household 
        in India.
            (10) The Power for All initiative of the Government of 
        India aims to provide electricity to all households in India 24 
        hours a day, 7 days a week.
            (11) Without action, climate change threatens to push 
        millions more people into poverty. Investments in clean energy 
        offer an opportunity to curb climate change while combating 
        poverty and increasing capacity to respond to the impacts of 
        climate change.
            (12) As of June 2020, coal makes up the largest domestic 
        source of energy supply and electricity generation for India. 
        In October 2020, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy 
        reported that renewable energy comprises approximately 12 
        percent of energy generation in India.
            (13) India imports 80 percent of its oil needs, and that 
        amount is projected to increase in the coming decades due to 
        aging oil fields and a lack of new oil discoveries in India. 
        India is increasing its oil refining capacity to maintain 
        supply to meet the rising domestic demand for energy.
            (14) India is projected to surpass the People's Republic of 
        China in oil consumption by 2030.
            (15) On September 22, 2020, the People's Republic of China 
        announced a pledge to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2060 
        in its updated Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris 
        Agreement, done at Paris December 12, 2015, but given the need 
        to accelerate the reduction of global emissions along a 2050 
        timeline, that pledge is insufficient to avoid an increase of 2 
        degrees Celsius in the global average temperature.
            (16) India, in contrast, is demonstrating that climate 
        action is a priority through concrete steps including a climate 
        plan compatible with the goal of limiting global average 
        temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius.
            (17) India's unconditional emissions target, as outlined in 
        the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution of India to the 
        Paris Agreement, aims to reduce emissions intensity of gross 
        domestic product by 33 percent to 35 percent below 2005 levels 
        by 2030.
            (18) In its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution, 
        India has also pledged to increase the share of its installed 
        electricity capacity that comes from nonfossil fuel sources to 
        40 percent by 2030 and create an additional 2,500,000,000 to 
        3,000,000,000 tons of carbon sinks.
            (19) In 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced an ambitious 
        domestic target of installing 450 gigawatts of renewable energy 
        capacity by 2030.
            (20) India is among the top 5 clean energy producers 
        globally. Installed electricity capacity from renewables in 
        India grew by 144 percent from 2014 to 2020, and between 2014 
        and 2019 there was approximately $42,000,000,000 in investment 
        in the renewable energy sector in India.
            (21) Numerous global funds, private equity firms, and 
        multilateral finance institutions are continuing to invest 
        billions of dollars in the growing renewable energy sector in 
        India.
            (22) India leads the International Solar Alliance, a 75-
        country initiative to which the United States does not yet 
        belong, to mobilize $1,000,000,000,000 in solar energy 
        investment by 2030.
            (23) Increased ownership of appliances and cooling needs 
        could lead to a doubling or even tripling of energy use in 
        India by 2040. One billion air conditioning units are expected 
        to be in use in India by 2050.
            (24) Under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on 
        Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, done at Montreal 
        September 16, 1987, India has agreed to freeze its 
        manufacturing and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons in 2028.
            (25) In 2005, the United States and India established a 
        formal energy cooperation dialogue, the United States-India 
        Energy Dialogue, which included engagement on clean, low carbon 
        technologies. In 2009, the United States and India expanded the 
        United States-India Energy Dialogue to advance clean and 
        sustainable energy development. The expansion in 2009 included 
        the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative focusing on 
        research into, deployment of, and access to clean energy.
            (26) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research 
        element of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, 
        commonly referred to as ``PACE-R'', consists of research 
        consortia under the Joint Clean Energy Research and Development 
        Center launched in 2010 by the Department of Energy and the 
        Government of India with support from the private sector. PACE-
        R has focused on solar power, advanced biofuels, energy 
        efficiency in buildings, and smart grids and energy storage.
            (27) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Deployment 
        element of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, 
        commonly referred to as ``PACE-D'', funds programs to improve 
        energy efficiency, grid connectivity, clean energy finance, and 
        more.
            (28) The Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Access element 
        of the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy initiative, commonly 
        referred to as ``PEACE'', has focused on finance and technology 
        innovation, skills development, and ecosystem strengthening for 
        clean energy.
            (29) In 2015, the United States and India launched the 
        U.S.-India Clean Energy Finance Task Force, which draws on the 
        finance expertise of the governments and private sectors of 
        both countries to tailor business and finance models to scale 
        India's clean energy sector.
            (30) Since 2015, the United States has supported the 
        Partnership for Climate Resilience, which links United States 
        Government climate scientists with their counterparts in India 
        to produce climate data and information to inform local 
        decisionmakers.
            (31) In 2018, the United States Government established the 
        Asia Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy 
        initiative, commonly referred to as ``Asia EDGE'', to support 
        sustainable and secure energy markets throughout the Indo-
        Pacific. Asia EDGE integrates elements of the Partnership to 
        Advance Clean Energy initiative along with new programs such as 
        the South Asia Group for Energy.
            (32) In 2018, the Governments of India and the United 
        States elevated the energy partnership to the U.S.-India 
        Strategic Energy Partnership to advance energy security, expand 
        energy innovation, and increase stakeholder engagement. That 
        partnership included pillars of cooperation on power and energy 
        efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable growth, and oil and 
        gas. The Governments of India and the United States also 
        continued clean energy research and development under the 
        Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research.
            (33) In 2021, the United States Government, through the 
        United States Agency for International Development, awarded 
        approximately $9,200,000 to support the Coalition for Disaster 
        Resilient Infrastructure, which the Government of India 
        launched in September 2019 at the United Nations Climate Action 
        Summit.
            (34) In 2021, at the Leaders Summit on Climate, the United 
        States and India launched the U.S.-India Climate and Clean 
        Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership to mobilize finance toward and 
        accelerate clean energy deployment, demonstrate and scale 
        innovative clean technologies, and build capacity to measure, 
        manage, and adapt to the risks of climate-related impacts. The 
        Partnership has two main tracks, the Strategic Clean Energy 
        Partnership (led by the Department of Energy) and the Climate 
        Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue (led by the Office of 
        the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate), which build on and 
        subsume previous, aforementioned processes.

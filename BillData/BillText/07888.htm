Improvement Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES SECURITY COOPERATION WITH 
              BAHRAIN.

     It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to maintain a strong relationship with Bahrain and 
        support its military efforts;
            (2) Bahrain has a critical role as host of the United 
        States Navy's Fifth Fleet and the United States Naval Forces 
        Central Command;
            (3) Bahrain is a major defense and security cooperation 
        partner of the United States, as recognized when the United 
        States designated Bahrain as a major non-NATO ally in 2002;
            (4) there should be an increase in exchanges between 
        defense officials and law enforcement of the United States and 
        Bahrain at the strategic, policy, and tactical levels, 
        especially for the purposes of--
                    (A) enhancing cooperation on defense planning;
                    (B) improving intelligence sharing to combat 
                terrorism; and
                    (C) improving interoperability between the Ministry 
                of Interior and the United States Navy's Fifth Fleet;
            (5) the United States should ensure Bahrain has 
        capabilities with regards to its air, missile, and unmanned 
        aerial system defense assets to support peace efforts in the 
        region;
            (6) it is important for the United States to be a source of 
        consistent and reliable defense assets for Bahrain;
            (7) the United States should deepen interoperability with 
        Bahrain in defense capabilities, including--
                    (A) maritime and air domain awareness;
                    (B) integrated air and missile defense systems; and
                    (C) counter unmanned aircraft system measures;
            (8) the Secretary of Defense should prioritize including 
        Bahrain in military exercises to the greatest extent possible, 
        increasing security cooperation and readiness between Bahrain 
        and the United States; and
            (9) it is in the best interest of the United States and 
        Bahrain to work together to oppose any efforts of terrorism or 
        radical extremism in the Middle East.

assessment of the efforts of the Department of Defense to--
            (1) increase exchanges between defense officials and law 
        enforcement of the United States and Bahrain at the strategic, 
        policy, and tactical levels, especially for the purposes of--
                    (A) enhancing cooperation on defense planning;
                    (B) improving intelligence sharing to combat 
                terrorism; and
                    (C) improving interoperability between the public 
                security forces and the United States Fifth Fleet;
            (2) ensure that Bahrain has capabilities with regards to 
        its air, missile, and unmanned aerial system defense assets to 
        support peace efforts in the region; and
            (3) deepen interoperability with Bahrain in defense 
        capabilities, including--
                    (A) maritime and air domain awareness;
                    (B) integrated air and missile defense systems; and
                    (C) counter unmanned aircraft system measures.

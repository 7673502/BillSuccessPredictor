SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON MISUSE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

(6 U.S.C. 455) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(a) Seal.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Department shall have a seal, the 
        design of which shall be subject to the approval of the 
        President.
            ``(2) Protection of seal.--Except with the written 
        permission of the Secretary, no person may knowingly use the 
        seal, or any colorable imitation thereof, of the Department in 
        a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that 
        the Department or any organizational component or element of 
        the Department has approved, endorsed, or authorized such use.
            ``(3) Construction.--Nothing in this subsection may be

        officers and employees of the Department in their course of 
        their official duties.
            ``(4) Existing design.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), 
        nothing in this subsection renders unlawful the use of any seal 
        of the Department the design of which was lawful as of the date 
        of the enactment of this subsection.''.

SEC. 2. TREATMENT OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT BEING REPAID.

    Section 203 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709) is amended 
by inserting after subsection (r) the following new subsection:
    ``(s) Treatment of Student Loan Debt Being Repaid.--
            ``(1) In general.--In determining eligibility of single-
        family mortgages, and mortgagors under such mortgages, for 
        insurance under this title, for purposes of any calculation of 
        the amount of liabilities of a mortgagor, or comparison of the 
        amount of such liabilities to the income of the mortgagor, the 
        Secretary shall consider a covered educational liability to 
        be--
                    ``(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), in 
                the same monthly amount as the amount that the 
                mortgagor is actually required to pay on a monthly 
                basis in connection with such liability; or
                    ``(B) in the case of a mortgagor whose required 
                monthly payment under such liability is $0, the amount 
                equal to 0.5 percent of the outstanding balance of the 
                loan in connection with such liability.
            ``(2) Covered educational liability.--For purposes of this 
        subsection, the term `covered educational liability' means a 
        liability--
                    ``(A) that is a student loan incurred for 
                educational purposes;
                    ``(B) that is required to be repaid through 
                payments made on a regular basis; and
                    ``(C) for which documentation has been provided 
                that is sufficient, in the determination of the 
                Secretary, to demonstrate that the liability complies 
                with the requirements under subparagraphs (A) and 
                (B).''.

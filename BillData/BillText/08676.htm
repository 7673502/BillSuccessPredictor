SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Salton Sea Public Health and 
Environmental Protection Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FEDERAL SALTON SEA MANAGEMENT ACRES.

    Title XI of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment 
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:

``SEC. 1102. RESTORATION PROGRAM.

    ``(a) Restoration Program.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting 
through the Bureau of Reclamation, shall provide for a program within 
the Bureau's Salton Sea Program Office to improve water quality, 
provide for dust mitigation, protect the public's health, and provide 
for environmental and habitat restoration at the Salton Sea in 
California.
    ``(b) Federal Salton Sea Management Acres.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
        provide for such measures as such Secretary determines 
        appropriate for dust control and habitat conservation, 
        consistent with State and local requirements, with respect to 
        an acreage within the Salton Sea of the same size as the 
        acreage for which the State of California provides for dust 
        control and habitat conservation under the Salton Sea 
        Management Program and the State Water Board Order. Such 
        Secretary shall, to the maximum extent possible when carrying 
        out this requirement, provide such measures for an equivalent 
        number of acres of dust control and of habitat conservation.
            ``(2) Calculation.--The Secretary of the Interior may 
        calculate the satisfaction of the Federal Salton Sea Management 
        Acres obligation described in paragraph (1) in three-year 
        increments to account for variability in acres available and 
        appropriate for management.
            ``(3) Coordination with the state of california.--
                    ``(A) Memorandum of understanding.--Not later than 
                180 days after the date of enactment of this section, 
                the Secretary of the Interior shall seek to conclude a 
                memorandum of understanding with the State of 
                California and the Salton Sea Authority to coordinate 
                Federal and State activities relating to the 
                construction, operation, and maintenance of Federal 
                Salton Sea Management Acres and Salton Sea Management 
                Program activities. Such memorandum of understanding 
                shall include a schedule delineating the timeframe for 
                the accomplishment of the establishment of Salton Sea 
                Management Acres and consideration of the effects of 
                such memorandum of understanding on affected 
                disadvantaged communities.
                    ``(B) Access.--The Secretary of the Interior shall 
                make Federal lands within the Salton Sea available to 
                the State of California for activities under the Salton 
                Sea Management Program and the State Water Board Order 
                and shall give priority to such activities.
            ``(4) State responsibilities.--Nothing in this section 
        shall modify the State of California's responsibilities or 
        associated timelines under the State Water Board Order.
            ``(5) Support from the secretary of agriculture.--The 
        Secretary of Agriculture shall, in issuing funding or other 
        types of support under such authority as is available to such 
        Secretary, prioritize support and funding to assist the 
        Secretary of the Interior in fulfilling the responsibilities 
        described in this subsection.
            ``(6) Delegation to the state of california.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of the Interior 
                may delegate such Secretary's responsibilities under 
                this subsection to the State of California through a 
                cooperative agreement or other contractual agreement 
                only upon the provision by such Secretary to the State 
                of adequate Federal funding to assure the requirements 
                of this section are met, including funding for 
                operations and maintenance of Federal Salton Sea 
                Management Acres. Such Secretary may award grants to 
                the State for completion of this responsibility.
                    ``(B) Agreement pending funding not restricted.--
                Subparagraph (A) shall not be construed to prohibit the 
                Secretary of the Interior from entering such an 
                agreement prior to the provision of such adequate 
                Federal funding.

              SEIZING ASSETS OF CERTAIN RUSSIAN CITIZENS.

    (a) Authority of President.--The President of the United States is 
authorized and requested to commission, under officially issued letters 
of marque and reprisal, so many of privately armed and equipped persons 
and entities as, in the judgment of the President, the service may 
require, with suitable instructions to the leaders thereof, to employ 
all means reasonably necessary to seize outside the geographic 
boundaries of the United States and its territories any yacht, plane, 
or other asset of any Russian citizen who is on the List of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons maintained by the Office of 
Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury.
    (b) Security Bonds.--No letter of marque and reprisal shall be 
issued by the President without requiring the posting of a security 
bond in such amount as the President shall determine is sufficient to 
ensure that the letter be executed according to the terms and 
conditions thereof.

SEC. 2. LIMITING CERTAIN LATE ENROLLMENT PENALTIES UNDER THE MEDICARE 
              PROGRAM.

    (a) Parts A and B.--Section 1839(b) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395r(b)) is amended--
            (1) in the first sentence, by inserting ``for each of the 
        first 12 months in which such individual is so enrolled'' after 
        ``shall be increased''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new sentences: ``In 
        the case of an individual who is subject to an increase under 
        this subsection for one or more months with respect to a 
        continuous period of eligibility and who terminates a coverage 
        period during such continuous period of eligibility and 
        subsequently reenrolls during the same continuous period of 
        eligibility, such individual shall be subject to an increase 
        under this subsection for each of the first 12 months in which 
        such individual is so reenrolled (or, in the case such 
        individual was subject to less than 12 months of an increase 
        under this subsection with respect to a previous enrollment 
        during the same continuous period of eligibility, for each of 
        the first 12 months beginning with the month after the last 
        month of application of any otherwise applicable increase under 
        this subsection). In calculating the amount of any increase 
        imposed under this subsection pursuant to the preceding 
        sentence with respect to the termination of coverage and 
        reenrollment of an individual, there shall only be taken into 
        account months that are described paragraph (2) of the second 
        sentence of this subsection with respect to such termination 
        and reenrollment.''.
    (b) Part D.--Section 1860D-13(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395w-113(b)(1)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``, for each of the first 12 months in 
        which such individual is enrolled in a prescription drug plan 
        under this part with respect to such continuous period,'' after 
        ``subsection (a)''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new sentences: ``In 
        the case of an individual who is subject to an increase under 
        this subsection for one or more months with respect to a 
        continuous period of eligibility and who terminates a coverage 
        period during such continuous period of eligibility and 
        subsequently reenrolls during the same continuous period of 
        eligibility, such individual shall be subject to an increase 
        under this subsection for each of the first 12 months in which 
        such individual is so reenrolled (or, in the case such 
        individual was subject to less than 12 months of an increase 
        under this subsection with respect to a previous enrollment 
        during the same continuous period of eligibility, for each of 
        the first 12 months beginning with the month after the last 
        month of application of any otherwise applicable increase under 
        this subsection). In calculating the amount of any increase 
        imposed under this subsection pursuant to the preceding 
        sentence with respect to the termination of coverage and 
        reenrollment of an individual, the term `uncovered month' shall 
        only include those months occurring during the period beginning 
        with such termination and ending with such reenrollment.''.

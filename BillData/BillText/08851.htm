this section may be filed in any calendar year if the OASDI trust fund

year following such calendar year is projected, based on the 
intermediate projections in the most recent (as of January 1 of such 
calendar year) annual report issued under section 201(c)(2), to be less

        custodial parents.
            (2) Descriptions of how employers will be recruited to 
        participate in such program and how the State will solicit 
        input from employers in the design and implementation of such

            (3) A description of how the State will promote long-term

SEC. 9. REQUIRING BIOLOGICAL FATHERS TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR MEDICAL 
              EXPENSES INCURRED DURING PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY.

    (a) In General.--Section 454 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
654) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (33), by striking ``and'' after the 
        semicolon;

        pocket medical expenses (including health insurance premiums or 
        similar charge, deductions, cost sharing or similar charges, 
        and any other related out-of-pocket expenses) the mother of the 
        child is responsible for that are incurred during, and

        provided that the mother requests the payment of such

    (b) Effective Date.--

            (2) Delay if state legislation required.--In the case of a 
        State plan under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act 
        which the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines

        appropriating funds) in order for the plan to meet the 
        additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by this 
        Act, the State plan shall not be regarded as failing to comply 
        with the requirements of such part solely on the basis of the

        the first day of the first calendar quarter beginning after the 
        close of the first regular session of the State legislature

SEC. 10. PREGNANT STUDENTS' RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATIONS, AND RESOURCES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Female students who are enrolled at institutions of 
        higher education and experiencing unplanned pregnancies may 
        face pressure that their only option is to receive an abortion 
        or risk academic failure.
            (2) 27.6 percent of all abortions in the United States are 
        performed on women of college age, between the ages of 20 and 
        24, according to a 2019 report by the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention.
            (3) A significant proportion of abortions in the United 
        States are performed on women of college age who may be unaware 
        of their rights under title IX of the Education Amendments of 
        1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) or deprived of an alternative to 
        receiving an abortion.
            (4) Additionally, women on college campuses may fear 
        institutional reprisal, loss of athletic scholarship, and 
        possible negative impact on academic opportunities.
            (5) An academic disparity exists because of the lack of 
        resources, support, and notifications available for female 
        college students who do not wish to receive an abortion or who 
        carry their unborn babies to term.
    (b) Notice of Pregnant Student Rights, Accommodations, and 
Resources.--Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1092) is amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(n) Pregnant Students' Rights, Accommodations, and Resources.--

order to promote improvements in maternal and child well-being, 
financial stewardship, child development, parenting, and access to 
social services and other community resources.
    ``(b) Application.--The Secretary may not award funds made 
available under this subsection on a noncompetitive basis, and may not

        ability to choose to receive federally funded social services 
        from religious organizations.

        applicable provision of law that requires or provides for a 
        religious exemption or accommodation that is equally or more 
        protective of a religious organization's religious exercise, an

        social services program shall not discriminate against a 
        covered beneficiary in the provision of a federally funded 
        program on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or a 
        refusal to hold a religious belief.
            ``(2) Special rule.--It shall not be considered 
        discrimination under paragraph (1) for a program funded by 
        Federal financial assistance to refuse to modify any components 
        of the program to accommodate a covered beneficiary who 
        participates in the organization's program.
            ``(3) Alternative services.--If a covered beneficiary has 
        an objection to the character or affiliation of the private 
        organization from which the beneficiary receives, or would 
        receive, services as part of the federally funded social 
        services program, the appropriate Federal, State, or local 
        governmental entity shall provide to such beneficiary (if 
        otherwise eligible for such services) within a reasonable 
        period of time after the date of such objection, a referral for 
        alternative services that--
                    ``(A) are reasonably accessible to the covered 
                beneficiary; and
                    ``(B) have a substantially similar value to the 
                services that the covered beneficiary would initially 
                have received from such organization.
            ``(4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `covered 
        beneficiary' means an individual who applies for or receives 
        services under a social services program.

religious organization, shall not be waived because of the religious 
organization's participation in, or receipt of funds from, a social 
services program funded with Federal financial assistance.
    ``(f) Limited Audit.--
            ``(1) In general.--A religious organization providing

        assistance may segregate Federal funds and any required 
        matching funds provided for such program into a separate 
        account or accounts. Only the separate accounts consisting of 
        Federal funds and any required matching funds shall be subject 
        to audit by the Federal Government with respect to an audit 
        undertaken for the purposes of oversight of Federal financial 
        assistance.

        providing services for a social services program using Federal 
        financial assistance contributes the organization's own funds 
        in addition to those funds required by a matching requirement 
        or agreement to supplement Federal funds, the organization may 
        segregate the organization's own funds that are not matching 
        funds into separate accounts, or commingle the organization's 
        own funds that are not matching funds with the matching funds. 
        If those funds are commingled, the commingled funds may all be 
        subject to audit by the Federal Government.

        fees, against an entity or agency that committed such 
        violation.
    ``(h) Federal Preemption of State and Local Laws.--With respect to 
any Federal financial assistance provided to a religious organization 
for the provision of a social service program, or such assistance 
commingled with State or local funds, no State or political subdivision 
of a State may adopt, maintain, enforce, or continue in effect any law, 
regulation, rule, or requirement covered by the provisions of this 
section, or a rule, regulation, or requirement promulgated under this 
section.
    ``(i) Construction.--The provisions of this section shall supersede 
all Federal law (including statutory and other law, and policies used 
in the implementation of that law) that is enacted or issued before the 
date of enactment of this section. No provision of law enacted after 
the date of the enactment of this section may be construed as limiting, 
superseding, or otherwise affecting this section, except to the extent 
that it does so by specific reference to this section.
    ``(j) Severability.--If any provision of this section or the 
application of such provision to any person or circumstance is held to 
be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section and the application 
of the provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be 
affected thereby.

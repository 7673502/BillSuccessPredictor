    To amend the Natural Gas Act to authorize expedited approval of 
  applications to export natural gas to certain allies of the United 
                    States, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expediting Natural Gas Exports to 
Allies Act''.

SEC. 2. NATURAL GAS EXPORTS TO ALLIES AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS.

    (a) Finding.--Congress finds that expediting the approval of 
natural gas export applications for projects intended to increase the 
capacity of the United States to export natural gas to allies and 
strategic partners will--
            (1) empower United States natural gas exporters to better 
        assist the strategic and national security interests of the 
        United States and allies and strategic partners of the United 
        States; and
            (2) lead to job growth, economic development, and energy 
        security.
    (b) Natural Gas Exports.--Section 3(c) of the Natural Gas Act (15 
U.S.C. 717b(c)) is amended--
            (1) by striking ``(c) For purposes'' and inserting the 
        following:
    ``(c) Expedited Application and Approval Process.--
            ``(1) Definition of covered nation.--
                    ``(A) In general.--In this subsection, the term

                            ``(ii) during the period described in

                        Act; and
                            ``(ii) ending on December 31, 2026, or such

                        interests of the United States.
            ``(2) Expedited approval.--Except as provided in paragraph 
        (3), for purposes'';
            (2) in paragraph (2) (as so designated), by inserting ``the 
        exportation of natural gas to a covered nation,'' before ``or 
        the exportation''; and
            (3) by adding at the end the following:
            ``(3) Exclusions.--

                restrictions imposed by the United States.
                    ``(B) Nations designated by congress.--The 
                Commission shall not grant expedited approval under 
                paragraph (2) of an application for exportation of 
                natural gas to any nation designated by an Act of 
                Congress as excluded from such expedited approval for 
                reasons of national security.''.
    (c) Effect.--The amendments made by subsection (b) shall not affect 
any Federal authorization to export natural gas from the United States 
to a foreign nation or to import natural gas into the United States 
from a foreign nation that is in effect on the date of enactment of 
this Act.

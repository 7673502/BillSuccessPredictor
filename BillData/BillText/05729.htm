    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Government Integrity is Not for 
Trade or Sale Act of 2021'' or the ``GIFTS Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. CONDITIONS FOR DONATION AGREEMENT.

    (a) In General.--Any covered contract entered into by an entity of 
the Federal Government, including an agency or an instrumentality, 
shall include terms and conditions agreed upon by any party to such 
contract that include prescriptive requirements that reflect the 
termination conditions described in subsection (b).
    (b) Termination Conditions.--The entity of the Federal Government 
described in subsection (a) may revoke any rights to name, designate, 
or redesignate the subject of any gift or donation (referred to in this 
section as ``naming rights'') contained in the contract described in 
such subsection without incurring liability or creating an obligation 
to return the gift or donation that is the subject of such contract to 
the donor under the following conditions:
            (1) A certain period of time has elapsed after the date of 
        the contract, given that such period--
                    (A) is at least 20 years; or
                    (B) is otherwise agreed to by such entity and the 
                donor.
            (2) In the reasonable view of such entity--
                    (A) an act, including a criminal act or an ethical 
                violation, has been committed before, on, or after the 
                date of the contract, by--
                            (i) the donor or an agent of such donor; or
                            (ii) an individual with respect to which 
                        naming rights were awarded pursuant to the 
                        contract; and
                    (B) because of the act described in subparagraph 
                (A), the revocation of such rights is necessary to 
                protect the reputation or integrity of the Federal 
                Government.
    (c) Definition of Covered Contract.--In this Act, the term 
``covered contract'' means any agreement or contract entered into by an 
entity of the Federal Government to--
            (1) accept a gift or donation from a donor; and
            (2) provide to the donor, or a third party as designated, 
        naming rights in connection with the acceptance of such gift or 
        donation.

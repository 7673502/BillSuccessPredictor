SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Expanding Access to Family Planning

    (a) In General.--There is established a Title X Clinic Fund to be 
administered through the Office of the Secretary of the Department of 
Health and Human Services (referred to in this section as the ``Office 
of the Secretary''), to provide for expanded and sustained national 
investment in clinics providing family planning services supported 
under title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.) 
(referred to in this section as ``title X clinics'').
    (b) Funding.--There is appropriated to the Office of the Secretary 
for the Title X Clinic Fund, out of any monies in the Treasury not 
otherwise appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2032--
            (1) $500,000,000 for necessary expenses for grants and 
        contracts under title X of the Public Health Service Act (42 
        U.S.C. 300 et seq.); and
            (2) $50,000,000 for infrastructure, including the 
        construction and renovation (including equipment) of title X 
        clinics.
    (c) Availability.--Amounts appropriated under subsection (b) shall 
remain available until expended.
    (d) Conditions on Funding.--
            (1) Prohibition.--No recipient of funds made available 
        under this section that makes a subaward for the provision of 
        title X services may prohibit an entity from participating in 
        such subaward program for reasons other than the entity's 
        inability to provide such title X services.
            (2) Pregnancy counseling.--In the case of services provided 
        by a title X clinic that receives funding made available under 
        this section, all pregnancy counseling shall be nondirective, 
        and, with respect to all patients of the title X clinic with a 
        positive pregnancy test, the following shall apply:
                    (A) All such patients shall be given the 
                opportunity to be provided information and counseling 
                regarding each of the following options:
                            (i) Prenatal care and delivery.
                            (ii) Infant care, foster care, and 
                        adoption.
                            (iii) Pregnancy termination.
                    (B) If the patient requests such information and 
                counseling, such patient shall be provided with 
                neutral, factual information and nondirective 
                counseling on each option described in subparagraph 
                (A), including referral upon request, except with 
                respect to any option about which the patient indicates 
                no interest in receiving such information and 
                counseling.
                                 &lt;all&gt;
